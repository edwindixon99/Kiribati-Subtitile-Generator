<i>Water.</i>

<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,774 --> 00:00:08,412
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:10,383
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:14,687
<i>My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days.</i>

6
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:16,326
<i>A time of peace.</i>

7
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:20,183
<i>When the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom,...</i>

8
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:22,945
<i>...Fire Nation, and Air Nomads.</i>

9
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:27,074
<i>But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

10
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:33,286
<i>Only the Avatar mastered all four elements.</i>

11
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:36,588
<i>Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders.</i>

12
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:42,413
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

13
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:48,242
<i>A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war.</i>

14
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:50,739
<i>Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe...</i>

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,116
<i>...journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation.</i>

16
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:58,072
<i>Leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.</i>

17
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:02,209
<i>Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads.</i>

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,306
<i>And that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope.</i>

19
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:12,154
<i>I still believe that somehow the Avatar will return to save the world.</i>

Thanks to Acastus and Pandora.

23
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:58,633
It's not getting away from me this time.

24
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:03,065
Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.

25
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,013
Sokka, look!

26
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:17,605
Shhh~ Katara, you're gonna scare it away.

27
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:20,253
Mmmm, I can already smell it cookin'!

28
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:23,432
But Sokka! I caught one!

29
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:25,802
Hey!

30
00:02:25,803 --> 00:02:26,855
Ugh!

31
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:32,922
Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?

32
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:36,601
Ah~ It's not magic. It's waterbending, and it's...

33
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:40,912
Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah...

34
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:44,809
Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.

35
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,602
You're calling me weird?

36
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:48,918
I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself...

37
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:53,015
...everytime I see my reflection in the water.

38
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,632
Watch out!

39
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,510
Go left! Go left!

40
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:25,506
You call that left?

41
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:26,607
You don't like my steering.

42
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:30,225
Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.

43
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:31,423
So it's my fault?

44
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:33,323
I knew I should have left you home.

45
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:37,012
Leave it to a girl to screw things up.

46
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:42,105
You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained...

47
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:46,113
...ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you!

48
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:50,111
Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp...

49
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:51,904
...while you've been off playing soldier!

50
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:53,903
Uh... Katara?

51
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:56,512
I even wash all the clothes!

52
00:03:56,513 --> 00:04:01,605
Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, not pleasant!!

53
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:03,606
Katara! Settle down!

54
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:06,702
No, that's it. I'm done helping you.

55
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:11,224
From now on, you're on your own!

56
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:25,606
Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.

57
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,608
You mean I did that?

58
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:30,814
Yup. Congratulations.

59
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:05,420
He's alive! We have to help.

60
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:10,456
Katara! Get back here! We don't know what that thing is!

61
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:47,014
Finally. Uncle, do you realize what this means?

62
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:49,325
I won't get to finish my game?

63
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:53,926
It means my search. It's about to come to an end.

64
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:59,208
That light came from an incredibly powerful source. It has to be him!

65
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:05,905
Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.

66
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:10,231
I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.

67
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:16,802
Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?

68
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:20,906
I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar.

69
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:25,024
Helmsman, head a course for the light!

70
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:44,613
Stop!

71
00:06:58,314 --> 00:06:59,953
Stop it!

72
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:13,708
I need to ask you something.

73
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:14,964
What?

74
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:17,104
Please... come closer.

75
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:19,556
What is it?

76
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,168
Will you go penguin sledding with me?

77
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,542
Uh... sure. I guess.

78
00:07:27,076 --> 00:07:28,382
What's going on here?

79
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:29,582
You tell us!

80
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,821
How'd you get in the ice? And why aren't you frozen?

81
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:36,172
I'm not sure.

82
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:47,219
Appa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy.

83
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:58,444
Haha! You're okay!

84
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:05,752
What is that thing?

85
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,452
This is Appa, my flying bison.

86
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:12,641
Right. And this is Katara, my flying sister.

87
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:25,792
Don't worry. It'll wash out.

88
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:28,840
So, do you guys live around here?

89
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,140
Don't answer that!

90
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,829
Did you see that crazy bolt of light? He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.

91
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,564
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy.

92
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:40,765
You can tell by that evil look in his eye.

93
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,519
The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.

94
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,919
I'm A...

95
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:02,597
I'm Aang.

96
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:06,535
You just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air.

97
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:08,335
Really? It felt higher that that.

98
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:10,526
Ah, you're an airbender!

99
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:11,526
Sure am.

100
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:14,300
Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders...

101
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:16,691
I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness.

102
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:20,595
I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.

103
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:27,716
Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift.

104
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,488
We'd love a ride! Thanks!

105
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:34,995
Oh, no... I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.

106
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:39,361
Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home?

107
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:43,738
You know... before you freeze to death?

108
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:50,074
Okay. First time flyers, hold on tight!

109
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:52,478
Appa, yip yip!

110
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:03,595
Come on, Appa. Yip yip.

111
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:06,613
Wow. That was truly amazing.

112
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:12,567
Appa's just tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see.

113
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:16,863
Why are you smiling at me like that?

114
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:19,834
Oh... I was smiling?

115
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,031
I'm going to bed now.

116
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,399
Yep. A man needs his rest.

117
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,199
Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.

118
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,169
Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him.

119
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:01,074
Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.

120
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:05,835
Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does.

121
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:09,979
This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.

122
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,418
Hey.

123
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,585
Hey. Whatcha thinkin' about?

124
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:25,570
I guess I was wondering...

125
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:31,114
...your being an airbender and all... if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar.

126
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:38,049
Uhh... no. I didn't know him... I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry.

127
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,853
Okay. Just curious. Goodnight.

128
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:43,449
Sleep tight.

129
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,361
Aang! Aang, wake up!

130
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:36,957
It's okay. We're in the village now. Come on, get ready. Everyone's waiting to meet you.

131
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:57,255
Aang, this is the entire village. Entire village, Aang.

132
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:03,085
Uh... why are they all looking at me like that?

133
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:04,366
Did Appa sneeze on me?

134
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,817
Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years.

135
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:12,833
We thought they were extinct until my granddaughter and grandson found you.

136
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:13,858
Extinct'?

137
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,961
Aang, this is my grandmother.

138
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,753
Call me Gran Gran.

139
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:22,428
What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this.

140
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:27,007
It's not for stabbing. It's for airbending.

141
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,508
Magic trick! Do it again!

142
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:35,199
Not magic, airbending. It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.

143
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,965
You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly.

144
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:41,960
Check again!

145
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:46,139
Whoa... it's flying...

146
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,005
...it's amazing!

147
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:06,143
Oh, my watchtower!

148
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:11,244
That was amazing.

149
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,972
Great. You're an airbender,...

150
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:21,188
...Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long.

151
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:22,762
You're a waterbender!

152
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:25,054
Well... sort of. Not yet.

153
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:29,899
All right. No more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores.

154
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,776
I told you! He's the real thing, Gran Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me.

155
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:38,343
Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.

156
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,275
But he's special. I can tell.

157
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:44,359
I sense he's filled with much wisdom.

158
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,202
Sthee? Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.

159
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:57,588
Again.

160
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:08,471
No! Power in firebending comes from the breath. Not the muscles.

161
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:11,989
The breath becomes energy in the body.

162
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,734
The energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.

163
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:18,912
Get it right this time.

164
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:21,966
Enough. I've been drilling this sequence all day.

165
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,577
Teach me the next set. I'm more than ready.

166
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:29,517
No, you are impatient. You have yet to master your basics.

167
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:32,242
Drill it again!

168
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,746
The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.

169
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:41,475
He must be over a hundred years old by now.

170
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:43,863
He's had a century to master the four elements.

171
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:47,222
I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.

172
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:51,776
You will teach me the advanced set!

173
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:58,176
Very well. But first I must finish my roast duck.

174
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:05,249
Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender.

175
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,592
In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing.

176
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:13,540
For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?

177
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:16,456
I gotta pee!

178
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:19,051
Listen! Until your fathers return from the war,...

179
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:21,500
...they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe.

180
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,053
And that means no potty breaks.

181
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:25,664
But I really gotta go.

182
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:30,703
Ugh... okay... who else has to go?

183
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:38,499
Have you seen Aang? Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.

184
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,796
Wow! Everything freezes in there!

185
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:47,983
Ugh! Katara, get him out of here. This lesson is for warriors only.

186
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,347
Stop! Stop it right now!

187
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,813
What's wrong with you? We don't have time for fun and games with a war going on.

188
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:02,599
What war? What are you talking about?

189
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,711
You're kidding, right?

190
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:08,111
Penguin!

191
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,241
He's kidding, right?

192
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,012
Aang?

193
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:26,271
Hey, come on little guy.

194
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:29,064
Wanna go sledding?

195
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:34,382
Heh heh, I have a way with animals.

196
00:17:37,118 --> 00:17:42,394
Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.

197
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:48,419
You got a deal! Just one little problem. I'm an airbender, not a waterbender.

198
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,196
Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?

199
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:55,734
No. You're looking at the only waterbender on the whole South Pole.

200
00:17:55,735 --> 00:18:00,386
This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water.

201
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:04,368
What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right?

202
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:06,732
Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.

203
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:11,497
Maybe. But we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time.

204
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:16,050
It's not exactly... turn right at the second glacier.' It's on the other side of the world.

205
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:18,687
But you forget, I have a flying bison.

206
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:22,165
Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole.

207
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,329
Katara, we're gonna find you a master!

208
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,892
That's... I mean, I don't know.

209
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:29,554
I've never left home before.

210
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:31,394
Well, you think about it.

211
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:35,411
But in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?

212
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:38,634
Okay, listen closely my young pupil.

213
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:45,115
Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. Observe.

214
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:13,614
I haven't done this since I was a kid!

215
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:16,496
You still are a kid!

216
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:40,917
Whoa... what is that?

217
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:46,824
A Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my people.

218
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:53,436
Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it. The ship could be booby trapped.

219
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:58,573
If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear.

220
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,948
This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl.

221
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:50,361
It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.

222
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:52,064
Okay, back up.

223
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:56,829
I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. I've never seen any war.

224
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,125
Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?

225
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,566
I don't know... a few days, maybe?

226
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:06,062
I think it was more like a hundred years!

227
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:10,577
What? That's impossible. Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old man to you?

228
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:15,698
Think about it. The war is a century old. You don't know about it because...

229
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:22,716
...somehow, you were in there that whole time. It's the only explanation.

230
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:26,616
A hundred years! I can't believe it.

231
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:31,777
I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this.

232
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:34,894
I did get to meet you.

233
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:38,572
Come on. Let's get out of here.

234
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:47,942
Aang? Let's head back. This place is creepy.

235
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,190
What's that you said about booby traps?

236
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,598
Hold on tight!

237
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:25,180
The last airbender. Quite agile for his old age.

238
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:31,672
Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar...

239
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:39,489
...as well as his hiding place.

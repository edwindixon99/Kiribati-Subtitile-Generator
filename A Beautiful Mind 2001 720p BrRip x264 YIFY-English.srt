1
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,680
Mathematicians
won the war.

2
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,319
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes-

3
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,680
and built the A-bomb.

4
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,959
Mathematicians...
like you.

5
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,599
The stated goal of the Soviets
is global Communism.

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,799
In medicine or economics,

7
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,040
in technology or space,

8
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,840
battle lines are being drawn.

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,480
To triumph,
we need results-

10
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,239
publishable,
applicable results.

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,439
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?

12
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,719
The next Einstein?

13
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,640
Who among you will be
the vanguard...

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,359
of democracy, freedom,
and discovery?

15
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,879
Today, we bequeath
America's future...

16
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,400
into your able hands.

17
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,199
Welcome to Princeton,
gentlemen.

18
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,000
It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

19
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
No, he has to have it
all for himself.

20
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,680
It's the first time
the Carnegie Prize...

21
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,639
has been split.
Hansen's all bent.

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,680
Rumor is he's got his sights
set on Wheeler Lab,

23
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,120
the new military
think tank at M.I.T.

24
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,800
They're only taking
one this year.

25
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,919
Hansen's used
to being picked first.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,520
Oh, yeah,
he's wasted on math.

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,319
He should be running
for president.

28
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,879
There could be
a mathematical explanation...

29
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,400
for how bad your tie is.

30
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,439
Thank you.

31
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:16,000
Neilson,
symbol cryptography.

32
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,240
Neils here broke
a Jap code.

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,840
Helped rid the world
of fascism.

34
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,039
At least that's what
he tells the girls,
eh, Neils?

35
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,879
The name's Bender.
Atomic physics.

36
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,919
- And you are?
- Am I late?

37
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,879
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Sol.

38
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,919
Oh, good.
Uh, hi.

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,639
- Sol. Richard Sol.
- The burden of genius.

40
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,719
- There he is.
- So many supplicants,
and so little time.

41
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,319
Mr. Sol.
How are you, sir?

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,639
Ah, Bender.
Nice to see you.

43
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,039
Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
Ah, thank you.

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,439
I'll take another.

45
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,639
Excuse me?

46
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,000
A thousand pardons.
I simply assumed you
were the waiter.

47
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,719
Play nice, Hansen.
Nice is not Hansen's
strong suit.

48
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,560
Honest mistake.

49
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, Martin Hansen.

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,800
It is Martin, isn't it?
Why, yes, John, it is.

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,039
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

52
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,159
I've read your pre-prints-

53
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,840
both of them.

54
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,759
The one on Nazi ciphers,

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,520
and the other one
on non-linear equations,

56
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,360
and I am
supremely confident...

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,759
that there is not
a single seminal...

58
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,439
or innovative idea
in either one of them.

59
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,079
Enjoy your punch.

60
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,920
Gentlemen, meet John Nash,

61
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,600
the mysterious
West Virginia genius.

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,160
The other winner
of the distinguished
Carnegie Scholarship.

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
Oh, okay. Oh, yeah?

64
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,439
Of course.

65
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,839
Oh, Christ.

66
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,560
The prodigal
roommate arrives.

67
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,279
Roommate?

68
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,920
Oh, God, no.

69
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,000
Ugh.

70
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,439
Did you know that having
a hangover is-

71
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,879
is not having enough water
in your body...

72
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,879
to run your Krebs cycles?

73
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,759
Which is exactly
what happens to you...

74
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,319
when you're dying
of thirst.

75
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,240
So, dying
of thirst...

76
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,399
would probably feel...

77
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,959
pretty much like
the hangover...

78
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,199
that finally
bloody kills you.

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,920
John Nash?

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,800
Hello.

81
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,319
Charles Herman.

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,279
Pleased to meet you.

83
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,160
All right, well done.

84
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,920
Well, it's official.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm almost human again.

86
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,759
Officer, I saw
the driver who hit me.

87
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,439
His name was Johnny Walker.

88
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,439
Whew.

89
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,920
Well, I got in last night
in time for...

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,079
English department
cocktails.

91
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,680
Cock was mine,

92
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
the tail belonged
to a particularly lovely
young thing...

93
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,240
with a passion for...

94
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,720
D.H. Lawrence.
You're not easily
distracted, are you?

95
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,040
I'm here to work.
Hmmm, are you? Right.

96
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,279
I see.
Crikey!

97
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,480
Is my roommate a dick?

98
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,040
Hmm?

99
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Listen.

100
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,480
If we can't break the ice,

101
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,680
how about we drown it?

102
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,920
So what's your story?

103
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,959
You the poor kid
that never got to go
to Exeter or Andover?

104
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,480
Despite my privileged
upbringing,

105
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,879
I'm actually
quite well-balanced.

106
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,279
I have a chip
on both shoulders.

107
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,079
Maybe you're
just better...

108
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
with the old integers
than you are with people.

109
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,879
My first grade teacher,
she told me...

110
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,839
that I was born
with two helpings of brain,

111
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,480
but only half
a helping of heart.

112
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,240
Wow!
She sounds lovely!

113
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,720
The truth is that l-

114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,079
I don't like people much.

115
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,199
And they don't
much like me.

116
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,439
But why,

117
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,120
with all your obvious
wit and charm?

118
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,519
Seriously, John.

119
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,519
Mathematics-

120
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,240
Mathematics is
never going to lead you
to a higher truth.

121
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,199
And you know why?

122
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,639
'Cause it's boring.

123
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,240
It's really boring.

124
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,519
You know half these schoolboys
are already published?

125
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,920
I cannot waste time
with these classes...

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,639
and these books.

127
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,480
Memorizing
the weaker assumptions
of lesser mortals!

128
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,560
I need to look through...

129
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,600
to the governing dynamics.

130
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,680
Find a truly original idea.

131
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,639
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.

132
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,959
It's the only way
that I'll ever-

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,639
Matter.

134
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,960
Yes.

135
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,799
All right,
who's next?

136
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,519
No, I've played enough "Go"
for one day, thank you.

137
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,399
Come on.
I- I hate this game.

138
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,039
Cowards, all of you!

139
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,000
None of you rise
to meet my challenge?

140
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,600
Come on, Bender.
Whoever wins,

141
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,600
Sol does his laundry
all semester.

142
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,279
Does that seem unfair
to anyone else?
Not at all.

143
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,559
- Look at him.
- Nash!

144
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,159
Taking a reverse
constitutional?

145
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm hoping to extract
an algorithm...

146
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,919
to define
their movement.

147
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,200
Oh.
Psycho.

148
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,000
Hey, Nash, I thought
you dropped out.

149
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,600
You ever going
to go to class or-

150
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,919
Classes will
dull your mind.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,320
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

152
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,240
Oh, oh, I didn't
know that.

153
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Nash is going to stun us all
with his genius.

154
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,919
Which is another way
of saying...

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,879
he doesn't have
the nerve to compete.

156
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,039
You scared?

157
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,480
Terrified.

158
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,879
Mortified.
Petrified.

159
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,559
Stupefied... by you.

160
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,080
No starch.

161
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,039
Pressed and folded.

162
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,759
Let me ask
you something, John.

163
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,600
Be my guest, Martin.

164
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,360
Bender and Sol here
correctly completed...

165
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,399
Allen's proof
of Peyrot's Conjecture.

166
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,440
Adequate work...

167
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,120
without innovation.

168
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,879
Oh. I'm flattered.
You flattered?

169
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,080
Flattered.

170
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,240
And I've got
two weapons briefs...

171
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,600
under security review
by the D.O.D.

172
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,759
Derivative drivel.

173
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,519
But Nash achievements:

174
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,840
zero.

175
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,639
I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual
question coming?

176
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,960
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,919
Huh?

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
How will it feel
when I'm chosen
for Wheeler...

179
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,440
and you're not?

180
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,960
What if you lose?

181
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,600
Ah, there it is.

182
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,639
You should not have won.

183
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,080
Hmmm.

184
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,600
I had the first move,
my-my play was perfect.

185
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,120
The hubris
of the defeated.

186
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,320
The game is flawed.

187
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,960
Gentlemen,
the great John Nash.

188
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,240
You've been in here
for two days.

189
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,960
You know Hansen's
just published another paper?

190
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,120
I can't even find a topic
for my doctorate.

191
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,120
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

192
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,840
This is a group
playing touch football.

193
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,120
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over bread crumbs.

194
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,519
And this here is a woman
who is chasing a man
who stole her purse.

195
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,600
John, you watched
a mugging.

196
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,039
That's weird.

197
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,679
In competitive behavior
someone always loses.

198
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,320
Well, my niece knows that,
John, and she's about this high.

199
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,600
See, if I could derive
an equilibrium...

200
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,120
where prevalence is
a non-singular event,

201
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,440
where nobody loses,

202
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,440
can you imagine the effect
that would have...

203
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,279
on conflict scenarios,
and arms negotiations...
When did you last eat?

204
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,720
When did you last eat?
...currency exchange?

205
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,440
You know, food.

206
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,360
You have no respect
for cognitive reverie,
you know that?

207
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
Yes. But pizza-

208
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,159
Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.

209
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,200
And of course beer.

210
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,960
I have respect for beer.

211
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,639
I have respect for beer!

212
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,039
Good evening, Neils.Hey, Nash.

213
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,960
Who's winning? You or you?

214
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,600
Evening, Nash.Hey, guys.

215
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,480
Hey, Nash.

216
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,159
He's looking
at you for sure.

217
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,279
Hey, Nash.

218
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,879
Neils is trying
to get your attention.

219
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,200
You're joking. Oh, no.

220
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,600
Go with God.
Come back a man.

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,559
Fortune favors the brave.
Bombs away.

222
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,440
Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success...

223
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,399
dramatically improve
with each attempt.

224
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
This is going
to be classic.

225
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,840
Maybe you want
to buy me a drink.

226
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,759
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say...

227
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,480
in order for you
to have intercourse with me,

228
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,080
but could we assume
that I said all that?

229
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,919
Essentially we're talking
about fluid exchange, right?

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,799
So, could we just
go straight to the sex?

231
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,679
Oh, that was sweet.

232
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,559
Have a nice night,
asshole!

233
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
Ladies, wait!

234
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,440
l-

235
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,559
I especially liked
the bit about fluid exchange.

236
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,639
It was really charming.

237
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,200
Walk with me, John.

238
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,399
I've been meaning
to talk with you.

239
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,279
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

240
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,720
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.

241
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,759
Wheeler, sir.
That would be
my first choice.

242
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,240
And actually,
I don't really have
a second choice, sir.

243
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,360
John, your fellows
have attended classes.

244
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,279
They've written papers.
They've published.

245
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,039
I'm still searching, sir,
for my-

246
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,759
Your original idea, I know.
Governing dynamics, sir.

247
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,440
It's very clever, John,
but I'm afraid...

248
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,799
it's just not nearly
good enough.

249
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,440
May l?
Thank you.

250
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,080
I've been working
on manifold embedding.

251
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,159
My bargaining stratagems
are starting to show
some promise.

252
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,799
If you could just
arrange another meeting,

253
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
if you'd be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein-

254
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,799
I've repeatedly asked
you for that.
Now, John.

255
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,240
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his-
John? John.

256
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,720
Do you see what they're
doing in there?

257
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,360
Congratulations. Thank you so much.

258
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,159
Congratulations,
Professor Max.

259
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,519
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

260
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,879
It's the pens.

261
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,120
Reserved for a member
of the department...

262
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,000
that makes the achievement
of a lifetime.

263
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,639
Now, what do you see, John?

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,320
Recognition.

265
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,039
Well done, Professor.
Well done.

266
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
Well, try seeing
accomplishment.

267
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,240
Is there a difference?

268
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,559
John,

269
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,759
you haven't focused.

270
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,799
I'm sorry,
but up to this point,

271
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,440
your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

272
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,279
Good day.

273
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,159
And my compliments
to you, sir.

274
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Thank you so much.

275
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,039
I can't see it.

276
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,639
- Aah!
-Jesus Christ, John.

277
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,000
I can't fail.

278
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,840
This is all I am.
Come on, let's go out.

279
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,799
I got to get
something done.
John!

280
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,600
- I can't keep
staring into space.
-John, enough!

281
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,080
Got to face the wall,
follow their rules,
read their books,

282
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,600
You want to do
some damage? Fine-

283
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,679
But don't mess around.
do their classes.

284
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,759
Come on!
Go on, bust your head!

285
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,440
Kill yourself.

286
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,759
Don't do it.
Don't mess around.

287
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,519
Bust your head!
Go on,

288
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,440
bust that worthless head
wide open.

289
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,519
Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is your problem?!

290
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,319
It's not my problem.

291
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,480
And it's not your problem.

292
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,599
It's their problem.

293
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,640
Your answer isn't
face the wall.

294
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,960
It's out there...

295
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,559
where you've been working.

296
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,319
That was heavy.

297
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,839
That Isaac Newton fellow
was right.

298
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,640
He was onto something.
Clever boy.

299
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,759
Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it in a minute.

300
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,079
Oh, God.

301
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,559
Incoming, gentlemen.Ay-yi-yi.

302
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,039
Deep breaths.

303
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,759
Nash, you might
want to stop...

304
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,920
shuffling your papers
for five seconds.

305
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,000
I will not buy
you gentlemen beer.

306
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,519
Oh, we're not here
for beer, my friend.

307
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,400
Oh.

308
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,039
Does anyone else feel
she should be moving
in slow motion?

309
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,640
Will she want
a large wedding, ya think?

310
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,119
Shall we say swords,
gentlemen?

311
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,039
Pistols at dawn?
Have you remembered nothing?

312
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,319
Recall the lessons
of Adam Smith,

313
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,279
the father
of modern economics.

314
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,079
"In competition...

315
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,720
individual ambition
serves the common good."

316
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,000
- Exactly.
- Every man for himself, gentlemen.

317
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,960
And those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

318
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,799
I'm not gonna strike out.

319
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,240
You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

320
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,240
- I don't think he said that.
- Nobody move-

321
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,279
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

322
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,920
Oh, God. He may have
the upper hand now,

323
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,079
but wait until he
opens his mouth.

324
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,200
Remember the last time?

325
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,400
Oh, yes, that was one
for the history books.

326
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,839
- Adam Smith needs revision.
- What are you talking about?

327
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,440
If we all go for the blonde,

328
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,279
we block each other.

329
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,480
Not a single one of us
is gonna get her.

330
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,079
So then we go
for her friends,

331
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,839
but they will all
give us the cold shoulder...

332
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,359
because nobody likes
to be second choice.

333
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,240
Well, what if no one goes
for the blonde?

334
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,920
We don't get
in each other's way,

335
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,799
and we don't insult
the other girls.

336
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,000
That's the only way we win.

337
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,440
That's the only
way we all get laid.

338
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,960
Adam Smith said...

339
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,359
the best result comes...

340
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,559
from everyone
in the group doing...

341
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,079
what's best
for himself, right?

342
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,079
That's what he
said, right?

343
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,960
Right.
Incomplete.

344
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Incomplete, okay?

345
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,559
Because the best result
will come...

346
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,200
from everyone
in the group...

347
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,839
doing what's best
for himself...

348
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,599
and the group.

349
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,799
Nash, if this is some way
for you to get the blonde
on your own,

350
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,480
you can go to hell.
Governing dynamics.

351
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,440
Governing dynamics.
Adam Smith...

352
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,119
was wrong.

353
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,839
Oh, here we go. Careful, careful.

354
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,960
Thank you.

355
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T."

356
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
You do realize this
flies in the face...

357
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,440
of a 1 50 years
of economic theory?
Yes, I do, sir.

358
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,319
That's rather presumptuous,
don't you think?

359
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,160
It is, sir.

360
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,599
Well, Mr. Nash,

361
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,480
with a breakthrough
of this magnitude,

362
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:27,440
I'm confident you will get
any placement you like.

363
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,200
Wheeler Labs,

364
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,720
they'll ask you to recommend
two team members.

365
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,319
Yes!

366
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,279
Stills and Frank
are excellent choices.

367
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,160
Sol and Bender, sir.

368
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,759
Sol and Bender are
extraordinary mathematicians.

369
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,759
Has it occurred to you
that Sol and Bender...

370
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,319
might have plans
of their own?

371
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,640
We made it!

372
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,559
Wheeler, we made it!

373
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:06,079
Cheers, cheers, cheers!
To- Oh! Oh!

374
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,599
Okay, awkward moment,
gentlemen.

375
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,799
Umm...

376
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,680
Hmm.

377
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,200
Governing dynamics.

378
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,200
Congratulations, John.
Thanks.

379
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,119
Toast!
To Wheeler Labs!

380
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
To Wheeler!

381
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,599
General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

382
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,359
Dr. Nash, your coat?

383
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,359
Thank you, sir.

384
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,240
Doctor. General, this is
Wheeler team leader
Dr. John Nash.

385
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,000
Glad you could
come, Doctor.

386
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,440
Hello.

387
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,319
Right this way.

388
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,000
We've been intercepting
radio transmissions
from Moscow.

389
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,440
The computer can't
detect a pattern,

390
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,160
but I'm sure
it's code.

391
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,440
Why is that, General?

392
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,920
Ever just know
something, Dr. Nash?

393
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,960
Constantly.

394
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,200
We've developed several ciphers.

395
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,119
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data...

396
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,079
Doctor?
6-7-3-7,

397
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,000
0-3-6...

398
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,960
8-4-9-4.

399
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,279
9-1 -4-0-3-4.

400
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
I need a map.

401
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,039
46-1 3-08,

402
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:02,599
67-46-90.

403
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,599
Starkey Corners, Maine.

404
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,400
48-03-01 ,

405
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,720
91 -26-35.

406
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,559
Prairie Portage,
Minnesota.

407
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,480
These are latitudes
and longitudes.

408
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,200
There are a least 1 0 others.

409
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,640
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.

410
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,920
Extraordinary.

411
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,279
Gentlemen, we need
to move on this.

412
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,079
Who's Big Brother?
You've done your country
a great service, son.

413
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,279
- Captain!
- Yes, sir.

414
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:40,640
Accompany Dr. Nash.

415
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,519
What are the Russians
moving, General?

416
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,119
Captain Rogers
will escort you...

417
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,920
to the unrestricted
area, Doctor.

418
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,559
Thank you.

419
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,920
Dr. Nash, follow me, please.

420
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:01,000
None of those who have
said they don't like the method...

421
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,880
have told us
any other method they could use
that would be effective.

422
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
And when you hear... It's Dr. Nash.

423
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,920
All right.

424
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,599
Thank you, sir.
Home run at the Pentagon?

425
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,200
Have they actually
taken the word "classified"

426
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,480
out of the dictionary?

427
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh, hi.
The air conditioning
broke again.

428
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,039
How am I supposed to be
in here saving the world...

429
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,839
if I'm melting?
Our hearts go
out to you.

430
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,799
You know, two trips
to the Pentagon in four years.

431
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,039
That's two more
than we've had.

432
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,759
It gets better,
John.

433
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,279
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

434
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,200
You know, the Russians
have the H-bomb,

435
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,279
the Nazis are repatriating
South America,

436
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,519
the Chinese have
a standing army of 2.8 million,

437
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:53,960
and I am doing
stress tests on a dam.

438
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,680
You made the cover
of Fortune... again.

439
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,240
Please note the use
of the word "you," not "we."

440
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,680
That was supposed
to be just me.

441
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,039
Oh.

442
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,200
So not only do they rob me
of the Fields Medal,

443
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,160
now they put me on the cover
of Fortune magazine...

444
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,599
with these hacks,
these scholars of trivia.

445
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,200
John, exactly what's
the difference...

446
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,920
between genius
and most genius?

447
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,680
Quite a lot.

448
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,480
He's your son.

449
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,319
Anyway, you've got
1 0 minutes.

450
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,039
I've always got 1 0 minutes.

451
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,279
Before your new class?

452
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:32,519
Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?

453
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,000
You are a doctor, John,
and no.

454
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:39,240
Now, come on, you know the drill,
we get these beautiful facilities,

455
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,319
M.I. T. gets America's
great minds of today...

456
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,359
teaching America's
great minds of tomorrow.

457
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Poor bastards.

458
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,920
Now, have a nice
day at school.

459
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,359
The bell's ringing.

460
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,680
The eager young minds
of tomorrow.

461
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,400
Can we leave one open,
Professor?

462
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,839
It's really hot, sir.

463
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,400
Your comfort comes second...

464
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
to my ability
to hear my own voice.

465
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,960
Personally,

466
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,880
I think this class will be
a waste... of your-

467
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,720
and what is
infinitely worse-

468
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,079
my time.

469
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,880
However, here we are.

470
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,599
So you may attend or not.

471
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,759
You may complete
your assignments
at your whim.

472
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,960
We have begun.

473
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,960
Miss.

474
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,480
Excuse me!

475
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,920
Excuse me!
Hey, hey!

476
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,680
Hi!

477
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,559
Um, we have
a little problem.

478
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,599
It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed...

479
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,160
and extremely noisy
with them open.

480
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,480
So, I was wondering
if there was any way you could,

481
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,279
I don't know,
maybe work someplace else...

482
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,000
for about 45minutes?

483
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,799
- Not a problem.
- Thank you so much!

484
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,720
At a break!
Got it!

485
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,400
Let's go. Clean it up a little bit.

486
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,359
As you will find
in multivariable calculus,

487
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,119
there is often...

488
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,799
a number of solutions
for any given problem.

489
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,559
As I was saying,
this problem here...

490
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,240
will take some of you
many months to solve.

491
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,000
For others among you,

492
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,319
it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

493
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,279
Professor Nash.

494
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,920
William Parcher.

495
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,359
Big Brother...
at your service.

496
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,920
What can I do
for the Department of Defense?

497
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,599
- Are you here to give me a raise?
- Let's take a walk.

498
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,640
Impressive work
at the Pentagon.
Yes, it was.

499
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,039
Oppenheimer used to say,

500
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,519
"Genius sees the answer
before the question."

501
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,440
You knew Oppenheimer?

502
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,079
His project was
under my supervision.

503
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,039
Which project?

504
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,599
That project.

505
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,279
It's not that simple,
you know?

506
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,920
Well, you ended
the war.

507
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,440
We incinerated 1 50,000 people
in a heartbeat.

508
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,279
Great deeds come
at great cost, Mr. Parcher.

509
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,839
Well, conviction,
it turns out,

510
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,039
is a luxury of those
on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

511
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,680
I'll try
and keep that in mind.

512
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,480
So, John, no family,

513
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,319
no close friends-

514
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,839
Why is that?

515
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,799
I like to think it's
because I'm a lone wolf.

516
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,920
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

517
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,759
Well, there are
certain endeavors...

518
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,559
where your lack
of personal connection...

519
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,599
would be considered
an advantage.

520
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,599
This is a secure area.
They know me.

521
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,720
Have you ever
been here?

522
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,519
We were told during
our initial briefing...

523
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,480
that these warehouses
were abandoned.

524
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,640
That's not
precisely accurate.

525
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,960
By telling you
what I'm about to tell you,

526
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,680
I am increasing
your security clearance...

527
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,319
to top secret.

528
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,880
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

529
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,240
Get it?

530
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,200
What operation?

531
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,519
Those are a good idea.

532
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,720
This factory is in Berlin.
We seized it
at the end of the war.

533
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,440
Nazi engineers
were attempting...

534
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,000
to build a portable
atomic bomb.

535
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,599
The Soviets reached
this facility before we did,

536
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,240
and we lost the damn thing.

537
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,519
The routing orders
at the Pentagon,

538
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,679
they were about this,
weren't they?

539
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,400
The Soviets aren't
as unified as people believe.

540
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,920
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svobga,

541
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,239
"the New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb...

542
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,800
and intends to detonate it
on U.S. soil.

543
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,559
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

544
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,119
Man is capable of as much atrocity
as he has imagination.

545
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,840
New Freedom has sleeper agents
here in the U.S.

546
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,719
McCarthy is an idiot,

547
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,760
but unfortunately
that doesn't make him wrong.

548
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,559
New Freedom communicates
to its agents...

549
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,360
through codes imbedded
in newspapers and magazines,

550
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,960
and that's
where you come in.

551
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:56,119
You see, John,
what distinguishes you...

552
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,880
is that you are,

553
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,480
quite simply,

554
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:03,159
the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.

555
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,360
What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?

556
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,079
Commit this list
of periodicals to memory.

557
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:24,039
Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes,

558
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,719
decipher them.

559
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:29,760
Place your chin
on the chin rest.

560
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,440
Stare into the light.
Pulse 88, regular.

561
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,199
Okay, this may be
a little uncomfortable.

562
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,760
That's got
a little zap to it,
doesn't it?

563
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,920
He just implanted
a radium diode.

564
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Don't worry, it's safe.

565
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,719
The isotope decays
predictably.

566
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,840
As a result,
these numbers change overtime.

567
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,159
They're the access codes
to your drop spot.

568
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:01,880
So what am I now,
a spy?

569
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:15,519
- Come.

570
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,760
Boy, you must be
really important.

571
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,519
It's all right, Mike.

572
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,760
What are you
working on?

573
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,599
Classified.

574
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,119
Everyone waited half an hour.

575
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:52,159
For?
Class.

576
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:54,239
You missed class today.

577
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,920
Oh. I suspect that...

578
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,159
nobody missed me.

579
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,239
The problem that you left
on the board-

580
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,320
I solved it.

581
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,519
Oh, no you didn't.
You didn't even look.

582
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:14,440
I never said
that the vector fields
were rational functions.

583
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,599
Your solution is elegant.

584
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:25,239
Though on this
particular occasion,

585
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:28,159
ultimately incorrect.

586
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,159
- You're still here.
- I'm still here.

587
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,599
Why?

588
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:58,039
I'm wondering,
Professor Nash,

589
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,440
if I can ask you to dinner.

590
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,400
You do eat, don't you?

591
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,800
Oh, on occasion, yeah.

592
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,400
Table for one.
Prometheus alone
chained to the rock...

593
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,679
with the bird
circling overhead,
you know how it is.

594
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,719
No, I expect
that you wouldn't-

595
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,440
you wouldn't know, uh-

596
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:26,239
If you leave your address
with my office,

597
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,280
I'll pick you up
Friday at 8:00...

598
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,800
and we'll eat.

599
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,079
One more thing.
Do you have a name,

600
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:43,519
or should I just
keep calling you "Miss"?

601
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,559
Governor,

602
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,039
may I present-
Miss Alicia Larde.

603
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,880
Miss Alicia Larde.
How do you do?

604
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,840
Professor, please.
You and the governor.

605
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,480
Wait, one second.
I'm sorry.

606
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,440
I want a copy of this.

607
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,639
First big date and all,
you know.

608
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,639
So, you boys need
to look good.

609
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,800
Which is not a state
you find yourselves in...

610
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,880
altogether naturally.

611
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,280
There. Better.

612
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,239
- I'm surprising him.
- You just keep on surprising him.

613
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,039
Professor.

614
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:41,039
God must be a painter.

615
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,320
Why else would we
have so many colors?

616
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,280
So you're a painter?

617
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,960
That's not actually
what I said,

618
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:54,679
but, yes-

619
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,800
I am.

620
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,000
Here.

621
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,880
Me.

622
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,400
Your date?

623
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,960
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

624
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,039
That's a plan.

625
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,039
Champagne would be lovely.

626
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,239
I'll be outside.

627
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,320
I will get the champagne.

628
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,159
Oh, thank you.

629
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,800
Thank you for that.

630
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,119
No, keep it.

631
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,280
I believe in deciding things
will be good luck.

632
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,119
Do you?

633
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:50,039
No.

634
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,000
I don't believe in luck.

635
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:58,639
But I do believe
in assigning value to things.

636
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,360
Oh.

637
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,880
I once tried
to count them all.

638
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,480
I actually made it
to 4,348.

639
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,760
You are exceptionally odd.

640
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,559
I bet you're very
popular with the girls.

641
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,039
A pair of odd ducks, then.

642
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,599
Mmm.

643
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,000
Pick a shape.

644
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,920
What?

645
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,039
Pick a shape.
An animal-
anything.

646
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,920
Okay.

647
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,400
An umbrella.

648
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,679
Do it again.

649
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,280
Do it again.
All right.

650
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,960
What would you like?
Do, uh...

651
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,440
an octopus.

652
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:20,480
You don't talk much, do you?

653
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:23,199
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

654
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:25,000
I don't mean work.

655
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,280
I find that polishing
my interactions...

656
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,199
in order to make
them sociable requires
a tremendous effort.

657
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,280
I have
a tendency to expedite
information flow...

658
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:43,760
by being direct.

659
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,119
I often don't get
a pleasant result.

660
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:48,400
Try me.

661
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,000
All right.

662
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,400
I find you attractive.

663
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:00,480
Your aggressive
moves towards me...

664
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,239
indicate that you
feel the same way.

665
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,000
But still,
ritual requires that we...

666
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:07,679
continue with a number
of platonic activities...

667
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,920
before we have sex.

668
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,119
I am proceeding
with those activities,

669
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:15,079
but in point
of actual fact,

670
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:19,079
all I really want to do
is have intercourse with you
as soon as possible.

671
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:23,199
Are you gonna
slap me now?

672
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
How was that result?

673
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:07,000
What are you doing?

674
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,800
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned reoccurrences...

675
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,440
within periodicals
over time. And you?

676
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:18,599
You talk funny,
Mr. Nash.

677
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:24,519
Do I know you?

678
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,840
My uncle says
you're very smart...

679
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,519
but not very nice,

680
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:30,599
so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

681
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:32,599
And who might
your uncle be?

682
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:35,039
The prodigal roommate...

683
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:36,920
returns.

684
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:42,840
Come here.
Charles, Charles, Charles.

685
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,920
My sister...

686
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,199
got herself killed
in a car crash.

687
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:54,760
Not too far now,
Marcee!

688
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,760
Her cowboy husband
was too drunk...

689
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,199
to know that he was
too drunk to drive.

690
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,599
So, I took her in.

691
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,079
She's so small.
She's young, John.
That's how they come.

692
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:11,079
I'm at Harvard...

693
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:13,760
doing the great
author's workshop.

694
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,800
D.H. bloody Lawrence.

695
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,920
I really do think you should
buy yourself a new book.

696
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:22,960
Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.

697
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,079
How are you, John?

698
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:29,079
At first all my work
here was trivial,

699
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:31,679
but a new assignment
came up and-

700
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,679
I can't really tell you
any details.

701
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,960
Top secret?
Black bag? Black ops?

702
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,079
Something like that.

703
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:42,719
And, uh...
Yes?

704
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,639
Well, l- I met a girl.

705
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,519
No! A human girl?
Homo sapiens.

706
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:49,639
A biped?
Yup. And contrary
to all probabilities,

707
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:51,599
she finds me attractive
on a number of different levels.

708
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:52,960
Really?

709
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,119
God, that's wonderful.

710
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,880
There's no accounting
for taste, is there?

711
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,880
Should I marry her?

712
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,840
Oh, God. Right.

713
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,039
I mean, everything's
going well.

714
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,599
The job is fine.
I have enough money.

715
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:11,320
It all seems to add up.

716
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,159
But how do you know
for sure?

717
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,320
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

718
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,360
That's the only
sure thing I do know.

719
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,000
Good evening.

720
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,400
Alicia, please don't
be angry.

721
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,920
I just lost track
of time at work...

722
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
again.
Mm-hmm.

723
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,400
I'm sorry.

724
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,320
I didn't have time
to wrap it.

725
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,760
Happy birthday.

726
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,840
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

727
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,679
they create
a full wavelength dispersal,

728
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,639
so if you look inside it,
you can see-

729
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,239
- Every possible color.
- Every possible color.

730
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,679
Yeah.

731
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,039
Remember you said that time
God must be a painter,

732
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,760
because of all the colors,
at the governor's house?

733
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,559
you said that.

734
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:13,719
I didn't think
you were listening.

735
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,079
I'm always listening.

736
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,679
It's beautiful.

737
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,840
Alicia, does our
relationship warrant
long-term commitment?

738
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,599
'Cause I need
some kind of proof,

739
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:48,800
some kind of verifiable,
empirical data.

740
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,239
I'm sorry,
just give me a moment...

741
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:01,559
to redefine
my girlish notions
of romance.

742
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:06,840
A proof?

743
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,440
Verifiable data.

744
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:11,039
Um... okay.

745
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,480
Well, how big
is the universe?

746
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,079
Infinite.

747
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:19,360
How do you know?

748
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,119
I know because
all the data indicate it.

749
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:22,840
But it hasn't
been proven yet?
No.

750
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,639
You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?

751
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,559
I don't, I just believe it.

752
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,119
Mmm.

753
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:32,800
It's the same
with love, I guess.

754
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,639
Now,

755
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:43,760
the part that
you don't know...

756
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,559
is if I want
to marry you.

757
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:10,760
Smile for the camera!

758
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,239
Well done!

759
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,159
Oh, sweet pea.

760
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:18,880
I love you.
Congratulations.

761
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,639
Hey, Sol.

762
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,840
You look beautiful.

763
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,039
Hi, how are you?

764
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,679
Hey, Sol.

765
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,639
Bye bye. Bye, now.

766
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,639
- Bye!
- Bye!

767
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,280
Be safe!

768
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:07,000
Get in.
Hurry.

769
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,079
They're following us.

770
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:18,039
Who's-
Who's following us?

771
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,679
The drop's been
compromised.

772
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:21,559
- Get down!

773
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:24,559
- Stay down.

774
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:53,280
- Here, take this.
- I ain't shooting anybody.

775
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,960
- Take the goddamn gun!
- No!

776
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:57,559
Son of a-

777
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,519
You stay back.
Don't move.

778
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,719
John?

779
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:10,079
Hi.

780
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,039
Where were you?

781
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:19,719
S-Sol-
Yeah, I talked to Sol.

782
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,320
He said you left
the office hours ago.

783
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,159
Why didn't you
call me?

784
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,960
Are you all right?

785
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,519
Honey?

786
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,559
John...

787
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:49,559
Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

788
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:52,800
John,
open the door.

789
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,280
Come on, open the door!
Let me in!

790
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,239
Talk to me!

791
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:01,719
John!

792
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,719
Open the door!

793
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,360
Watch for cars, kids.

794
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:05,079
John.

795
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:07,480
William.

796
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:09,760
This is not what
I signed on for.

797
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,719
Every time
a car backfires
or a door slams-

798
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,440
I understand-
better than you
could possibly imagine.

799
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,159
You need
to calm down, John.

800
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:29,760
Now listen to me.
We're closing in
on the bomb,

801
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,119
in large part
due to your work.

802
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,719
Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?

803
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,480
William, my circumstance
has changed.

804
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:39,800
Alicia's pregnant.

805
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:50,719
I told you attachments
were dangerous.

806
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,639
You chose to marry
the girl.

807
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:56,159
I did nothing
to prevent it.

808
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,159
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety...

809
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:03,320
is for you to continue
your work.

810
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,880
Well, I'll just quit.

811
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,679
You won't.

812
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:09,280
Why would I not?

813
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,320
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

814
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,039
You quit
working for me,

815
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:17,679
I quit working for you.

816
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,360
Parcher!

817
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,840
Parcher!

818
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:39,159
John, you all right?

819
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:00,440
John?

820
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:02,039
Turn it off!
Turn off the light!

821
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:07,239
Why would you
do that?

822
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,920
Why would you
turn the light on?

823
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,400
What is wrong
with you?

824
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,280
You have to go
to your sister's.

825
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,880
I left the car out the back.
You take Commonwealth.

826
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,880
No side streets,
you stay where it's crowded.
John, I'm not going anywhere!

827
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,280
When you get to your sister's,
you wait for me to call you.

828
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,360
No, I'm not going.
Just get your things.

829
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,880
I'm not leaving-
Stop! Stop it!

830
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,440
Please, Alicia.

831
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:31,639
I'll explain
when I can.

832
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:18,039
Uncle John!

833
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,119
Uncle John!

834
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,559
- Hey, baby girl!

835
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:28,320
Wow, someone
needed a hug!

836
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,880
I saw you on the slate
and I thought to myself,

837
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,079
"How can I miss seeing
a guest lecture...

838
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:35,199
by the inimitable
John Nash?"

839
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,000
What's wrong?

840
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:44,960
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

841
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,760
Well, now you tell me,
what is it?

842
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,960
Professor Nash!

843
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,159
Welcome!

844
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,519
After?

845
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,880
So, we see that
the- the zeroes,

846
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,440
of the Reimann
Zeta function,

847
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:09,119
correspond
to singularities...

848
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:12,320
in space-time,

849
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,159
singularities
in space-time-

850
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,679
and conventional
number theory...

851
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:26,880
It breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

852
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:43,639
Sometimes
our expectations...

853
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:46,039
are betrayed
by the numbers.

854
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,000
Variables are impossible
to assign any...

855
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,519
rational value.

856
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:12,599
Professor Nash!

857
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,480
- Hold it!
- Professor Nash?

858
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,519
Professor Nash,

859
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:31,880
let's avoid a scene, shall we?

860
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,880
What do you want?

861
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,480
My name is Rosen,

862
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,440
Dr. Rosen.
I'm a psychiatrist.

863
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:41,480
Forgive me
if I don't seem
persuaded.

864
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:44,119
I'd like you
to come with me, John.

865
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:46,920
Just for a chat.

866
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:49,880
It appears I have
no choice.

867
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,320
Oh-hh!

868
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,639
Help me!
Somebody!

869
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,960
Somebody!

870
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:11,360
Help me!
Get off me!

871
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,639
I know who you are!
I know who you are!

872
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:15,320
No, no, no,
no, don't.

873
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,159
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

874
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:19,000
Call somebody!
Call somebody, Charles!

875
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:20,480
They're Russians!
Steady the leg.

876
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:22,239
Get away from me.

877
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,440
Stay away from me!

878
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:31,559
There, now.

879
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:33,400
All better.

880
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,039
Everything's
all right here.

881
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,800
Watch your head.

882
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,880
John?

883
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,840
Can you hear me?

884
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:32,000
Go easy now.

885
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:34,840
Thorazine takes
a little while
to wear off.

886
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,000
Sorry about
the restraints.

887
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:42,519
You've got one hell
of a right hook.

888
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:45,599
Where am l?

889
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:47,239
Ahem.

890
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,559
MacArthur
Psychiatric Hospital.

891
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:55,159
I find that
highly unlikely.

892
01:04:55,239 --> 01:04:56,639
You made
a mistake.

893
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:00,480
My work is non-military
in application.

894
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:02,920
Which work
is that, John?

895
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,719
I don't know
anything.

896
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,239
There's no good
in keeping secrets, you know.

897
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,960
Charles?

898
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,800
Charles?

899
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,320
I didn't mean to get you
involved in this.

900
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:37,360
I'm- I'm sorry.

901
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:43,800
Charles?

902
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:52,039
The prodigal roommate
revealed.

903
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,880
"Saw my name
on the lecture slate."

904
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,000
You lying son
of a bitch!

905
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,679
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

906
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,239
How do you say,
"Charles Herman" in Russian?

907
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,679
How do you say it
in Russian?

908
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,920
There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.

909
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,440
He's right there.
He's right there.

910
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:16,480
Stop!
I don't know anything!

911
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,119
Stop!
l- I don't know anything!

912
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,199
My name is John Nash.

913
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:24,800
I'm being held
against my will.

914
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,320
Somebody call
the Department of Defense.

915
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,119
My name is John Nash.

916
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:31,559
I'm being held
against my will!

917
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,800
What's wrong with him?

918
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,519
John has
schizophrenia.

919
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:47,199
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

920
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,440
But-
But his work.

921
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:54,679
He deals
with conspiracies...

922
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:57,800
Yes, yes, I know.

923
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,880
In John's world,
these behaviors
are... accepted,

924
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,519
encouraged.

925
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:06,880
As such, his illness
may have gone untreated...

926
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,639
far longer
than is typical.

927
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:11,159
What do you mean?
How long?

928
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:13,280
Possibly since
graduate school?

929
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,480
At least that's when
his hallucinations
seem to have begun.

930
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:18,760
What are you
talking about?
What hallucinations?

931
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,960
One, so far,
that I am aware of.

932
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,320
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

933
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,679
Charles
isn't imaginary.

934
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:30,239
He and John
have been best friends
since Princeton.

935
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,159
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

936
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,000
He's always in town
for so little time,
lecturing.

937
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:38,719
Was he at your wedding?
He had to teach.

938
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,360
Have you ever
seen a picture of him,

939
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,880
talked to him
on the telephone?
This is ridiculous.

940
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,079
I phoned Princeton.

941
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:46,880
According to their
housing records,

942
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,760
John lived alone.

943
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:54,880
Now, which is more likely-
that your husband,

944
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,119
a mathematician
with no military training,

945
01:07:57,159 --> 01:07:59,519
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians-

946
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:01,159
You're making him
sound crazy.

947
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:04,320
...or, that he has
lost his grip on reality?

948
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:08,320
Now the only way
I can help him...

949
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,639
is to show him
the difference...

950
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:12,360
between what's real...

951
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,519
and what is in his mind.

952
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:18,880
Come on.

953
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,720
What's he been
working on?

954
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,600
His work
is classified.

955
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,840
He mentioned
a supervisor...

956
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,279
by the name
of William Parcher.

957
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:33,239
Maybe Mr. Parcher
can clarify things
for us.

958
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:35,680
But I can't get to him
without clearances.

959
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,119
You want me to help you get...

960
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:40,119
the details
of my husband's work?

961
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:43,520
John thinks
I'm a Russian spy.

962
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,479
Is that what
you think?

963
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,319
What did
the doctor say?
Is he sick?

964
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:53,920
I don't know.

965
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,800
I want to see what John's
been working on.

966
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,720
You know you can't
go in his office.
It's classified, Alicia.

967
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,680
Stop. Oh!

968
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:15,279
Oh, my God.

969
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:21,079
Oh, my God.

970
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:30,600
Why didn't you
say something?

971
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,560
Alicia,
John's always been...

972
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,880
a little weird.

973
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,079
He said he was
doing code-breaking,

974
01:09:38,119 --> 01:09:40,199
that it was eyes-only.

975
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:43,159
Top secret, part
of the military effort.
Was he?

976
01:09:43,239 --> 01:09:45,600
Well,
it was possible,
you know?

977
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,039
Directives come down
all the time...

978
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:48,439
that some of us
aren't cleared for.

979
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,880
- It was possible.
- Possible, but...

980
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,640
not likely.

981
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:56,960
Lately, he'd become
so much more agitated...

982
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,079
and then
when you called-

983
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:01,640
So, is this all
he's been doing
every day?

984
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,960
Cutting out
magazines?

985
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:08,039
Well, not all.

986
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,239
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

987
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:34,319
I missed you.
I missed you.

988
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,520
I have to talk
to you.

989
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,560
Okay.

990
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,520
Alicia, I've been
thinking about it,

991
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,039
and I do realize
that my behavior...

992
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:54,079
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you...

993
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,479
must have appeared
insane.

994
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,680
I left you
with no other choice.

995
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,800
I do understand...

996
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,640
and I'm truly sorry.
That's okay.

997
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,119
Everything's
gonna be all right.

998
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,640
Everything's
gonna be all right.

999
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,520
We just have to talk quietly.

1000
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,039
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

1001
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:21,560
I'm gonna tell you
everything now.

1002
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,000
It's breaking
with protocol...

1003
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,920
but you need
to know,

1004
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,680
because you
have to help me
get out of here.

1005
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:34,199
I've been doing
top secret work
for the government.

1006
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:35,960
There's a threat
that exists...

1007
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:38,560
of catastrophic
proportions.

1008
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,399
I think the Russians
feel my profile is too high.

1009
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:43,720
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.

1010
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,039
They're keeping me here
to try to stop me...

1011
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:48,319
from doing my work.
You have to get to Wheeler.

1012
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:50,359
You have to find
William Parcher.
Stop.

1013
01:12:50,439 --> 01:12:53,239
He can help us.
Stop. Stop. Stop!

1014
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,520
I went to Wheeler.

1015
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,159
Good, good.

1016
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:03,199
There is no
William Parcher.

1017
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:05,439
Of course there is.

1018
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:07,479
I've been working for him.
Doing what?

1019
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,560
Breaking codes?

1020
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,640
Dropping packages
in a secret mailbox...

1021
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,560
for the government
to pick up?

1022
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:16,800
How could you
know that?

1023
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,920
Sol followed you.

1024
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,319
He thought it
was harmless.
Sol followed me?

1025
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:33,560
They've never
been opened.

1026
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:38,720
It isn't real.

1027
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,880
There is
no conspiracy, John.

1028
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:46,840
There is
no William Parcher.

1029
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,199
It's in your mind.

1030
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,199
Do you
understand, baby?

1031
01:13:55,239 --> 01:13:57,800
You're sick.

1032
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,840
You're sick, John.

1033
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,479
John!

1034
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,359
John!

1035
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:15,960
Code red.

1036
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:18,399
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

1037
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:21,880
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

1038
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,640
John?

1039
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:38,039
John?

1040
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,119
The implant's gone.

1041
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:45,039
I can't find it.

1042
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,640
It's gone.

1043
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,479
You see, the nightmare
of schizophrenia...

1044
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,800
is not knowing
what's true.

1045
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,279
Imagine...

1046
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:31,359
if you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places...

1047
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:34,279
and the moments
most important to you...

1048
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:36,760
were not gone, not dead,

1049
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,199
but worse-

1050
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:41,119
had never been.

1051
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,399
What kind of hell
would that be?

1052
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:53,239
Administering
insulin.

1053
01:15:54,279 --> 01:15:56,439
8.42AM.

1054
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,880
How often?

1055
01:16:55,399 --> 01:16:58,199
Five times a week
for 1 0 weeks.

1056
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:23,840
John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.

1057
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,560
And Hansen is running
the department now.

1058
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,199
So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.

1059
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:31,520
Yeah.

1060
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,720
John won't come near
the campus, though.

1061
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,600
I think he's ashamed.

1062
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,520
Hey. Hey.

1063
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,600
Want this?

1064
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:45,159
So, Alicia, how-
how are you holding up?

1065
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:47,880
Well, the delusions
have passed.

1066
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,119
They're saying
with the medication...

1067
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:51,720
and low stress
environment-

1068
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,479
No, l- I mean,
how are you?

1069
01:18:01,479 --> 01:18:03,640
I think often
what I feel...

1070
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,800
is obligation.

1071
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,960
Or guilt
over wanting to leave.

1072
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:17,239
Rage against John,
against God and-

1073
01:18:19,239 --> 01:18:20,479
But...

1074
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:25,520
then I look at him...

1075
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:31,159
and I force myself to see
the man that I married.

1076
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:33,920
And he becomes that man.

1077
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:38,199
He's transformed
into someone that I love.

1078
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:43,479
And I'm transformed
into someone who loves him.

1079
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:48,159
It's not all the time,

1080
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:50,920
but...

1081
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,640
it's enough.

1082
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,560
I think John is
a very lucky man...

1083
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,239
Alicia.

1084
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,279
So unlucky.

1085
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,159
This is us. This is it?

1086
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:11,840
It's nice.
It's near where I work.

1087
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,279
John? You've a visitor.

1088
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,720
Hi.

1089
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,279
Hi.

1090
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:22,159
I hope it's okay.

1091
01:19:29,319 --> 01:19:30,840
Hey ya, chief.

1092
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,680
- Cigarette?
- Ah, no, thanks.

1093
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,760
I quit, actually.

1094
01:19:40,279 --> 01:19:42,520
Hello.
Hey, John.

1095
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,239
Have you met
Harvey?

1096
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:47,680
Umm, l...

1097
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,840
-John, there's no-
- Relax, it's okay.

1098
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,439
There's no point
in being nuts if you can't
have a little fun.

1099
01:19:53,479 --> 01:19:55,399
Jesus Christ, John.

1100
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:57,039
I should have known.

1101
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:00,239
Here you go.

1102
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,560
I can take those later.

1103
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,119
You're supposed
to take them now.

1104
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:09,640
- Can I bring you something?
- I'm okay.

1105
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,159
Okay.

1106
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,479
So, um... yeah.
I- I was in town...

1107
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,600
giving a workshop.

1108
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,600
I go back tonight.

1109
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,840
You know, Bender,
he really wanted...

1110
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:27,239
to stop by
and you know, see you.
You know, say hi.

1111
01:20:27,319 --> 01:20:28,920
Squeamish?

1112
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,319
Yeah.

1113
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,760
I suppose
I would be, too.

1114
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,720
But alas,
I'm stuck with me.

1115
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:42,119
I'm trying to solve
the Reimann hypothesis.
Uh-huh.

1116
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,439
Oh, yeah?

1117
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,520
I figured if-
if I dazzle them,

1118
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,680
they will have
to reinstate me.

1119
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:55,560
But it's difficult
with the medication,

1120
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:58,920
because it's hard to...

1121
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,399
see the solution.

1122
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,279
You know, John,
you should go easy.

1123
01:21:13,319 --> 01:21:16,199
There are other
things besides-

1124
01:21:16,279 --> 01:21:17,520
besides work.

1125
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,880
What are they?

1126
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:41,000
Shh-hh.

1127
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,840
Shh.

1128
01:21:56,399 --> 01:21:58,319
What are you
thinking about?

1129
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:03,199
What do people do?

1130
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:05,600
It's life, John.

1131
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,560
Activities available,

1132
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,119
just add meaning.

1133
01:22:17,239 --> 01:22:19,319
You could try
leaving the house.

1134
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:22,680
You know, maybe...

1135
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,760
talk to people.

1136
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,439
You could try
taking out the garbage.

1137
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,199
And there's some more-
there's some more in...

1138
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:09,439
Who- Who were
you talking to?

1139
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:11,479
Garbage man.

1140
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:22,840
Garbage men don't come
at night.

1141
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:27,439
I guess around here
they do.

1142
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,680
Sorry.

1143
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,560
Is it the medication?

1144
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:41,720
I don't know
what to do.

1145
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:01,560
My mother's
going to keep the baby
a little longer tonight.

1146
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,800
I can get three hours
of overtime.

1147
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,680
I'm going to bed.

1148
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:40,920
- Good night.
- Good night.

1149
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,239
It's good to see you, John.

1150
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:01,279
It's been a while.

1151
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,239
Parcher?

1152
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:05,319
Yes, sir.

1153
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,119
You're not real!

1154
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:12,840
Of course I am.
Don't be ridiculous.

1155
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:19,600
I don't think that I would
go that way, John.

1156
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:23,319
It's time for you
to get back to work.

1157
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:26,239
The bomb is in
its final position...

1158
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:27,760
here in the U.S.

1159
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:30,840
Knowing
your situation...

1160
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,439
requires you keep
a low profile,
"Mohammed,"

1161
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,520
we've brought
the mountain to you.

1162
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,439
We've narrowed the bomb's
location to somewhere...

1163
01:28:57,479 --> 01:28:59,199
on the eastern seaboard.

1164
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:03,720
But we haven't been able
to pinpoint its exact position.

1165
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,479
Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.

1166
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,199
Here, look at this, John.

1167
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,279
What?

1168
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:18,640
What?

1169
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:24,600
- Dr. Rosen said-
- Rosen! That quack!

1170
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,560
"Schizophrenic break
from reality," right?

1171
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,479
Psychological bullshit!

1172
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,439
Look at me, John.

1173
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,800
John, look at me.

1174
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,439
Do I look
like I'm imagined?

1175
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,680
Wheeler has
no record of you.

1176
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,119
Do you think we list
our personnel?

1177
01:29:45,159 --> 01:29:48,199
John, I'm sorry you had
to go through all this.

1178
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:51,560
I've gone to a great deal
of trouble to get you back.

1179
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,239
I can restore
your status at Wheeler.

1180
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:56,920
I can let the world
know what you did.

1181
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,439
But I need you now, soldier.

1182
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:07,479
I was so scared
you weren't real.

1183
01:30:15,479 --> 01:30:17,319
There's a storm
coming.

1184
01:30:17,399 --> 01:30:19,560
I'm just going to grab
the laundry, okay?

1185
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,560
I'll draw his bath.

1186
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,399
It's okay.

1187
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,479
Okay.

1188
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,800
John?

1189
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:14,079
I've almost got it!
Charles, you just
watch the baby.

1190
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:15,279
I've got one more to close!

1191
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:17,199
- No!
- I'll be right there.

1192
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:19,800
- Oh, God.

1193
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,399
I need a towel.

1194
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:27,479
Shhh.

1195
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,119
Charles was watching him.
He was okay.

1196
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:30,920
There is no one here.

1197
01:32:32,279 --> 01:32:34,119
- Charles was watching him.
- There is no one here!

1198
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:36,000
He's been injected
with a cloaking serum.

1199
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:37,760
I can see him
because of a chemical...

1200
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,880
that was released
into my bloodstream...

1201
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,319
when my implant dissolved.

1202
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,760
I couldn't tell you,
it was for your own protection!

1203
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:48,000
Alicia!

1204
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:56,800
- No!
- Hello, I need
Dr. Rosen's office, please.

1205
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,520
You've got
to stop her, John.

1206
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,960
You leave her out of this.

1207
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:06,239
- Who are you talking to?
- It's not her fault.

1208
01:33:06,279 --> 01:33:08,479
-John.
- She'll compromise us again.

1209
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,840
- No, she won't.
- You'll go back to the hospital.

1210
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,920
-John, answer me!
- Countless people will die.

1211
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,560
Alicia, please,
put the phone down.

1212
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,119
- I can't let that happen.
- Yes, hello?

1213
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,359
Hi, I need Dr. Rosen.
Is he in?

1214
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:21,800
I'm sorry, John.

1215
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,359
No-oo!

1216
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,479
Alicia?

1217
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,399
You know
what you have to do, Nash.

1218
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:31,840
- Get away from me.
- She's too great a risk.

1219
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,079
Get away!

1220
01:33:34,119 --> 01:33:36,079
I didn't mean
to hurt you!

1221
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:41,039
Finish her.
She knows too much now.

1222
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:45,279
Uncle John?

1223
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:47,279
Take care of her,
you pathetic piece of shit,

1224
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:48,640
or I'll take care of you.

1225
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:50,079
John,

1226
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,680
Christ, John,
please do what he says.

1227
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,399
Move, soldier.

1228
01:33:55,479 --> 01:33:56,880
Now.

1229
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,119
Uncle John?

1230
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:00,720
John, please!

1231
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,720
Now!

1232
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:05,600
Alicia and Charles never
coexist in the same...

1233
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,439
interactive field.
Alicia and Parcher...

1234
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:16,520
- Let's play!

1235
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,199
...Charles, and Marcee cannot
coexist with Alicia.

1236
01:34:19,239 --> 01:34:20,880
I understand.

1237
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,439
She never gets old.

1238
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:44,399
Marcee can't be real.
She never gets old.

1239
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,319
You see them now?

1240
01:35:26,199 --> 01:35:27,840
Yes.

1241
01:35:30,039 --> 01:35:32,239
Why did you
stop your meds?

1242
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:36,640
Because I couldn't
do my work.

1243
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,560
I couldn't help
with the baby.

1244
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,319
I couldn't-

1245
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,880
I couldn't respond
to my wife.

1246
01:35:46,119 --> 01:35:48,359
You think that's better
than being crazy?

1247
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:51,399
We'll need to start you
on a higher run...

1248
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:53,359
of insulin shocks
and a new medication.

1249
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:55,000
No.

1250
01:35:55,079 --> 01:35:56,840
There has
to be another way.

1251
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:01,119
Schizophrenia is degenerative.
Some days maybe symptom-free,

1252
01:36:01,159 --> 01:36:02,760
but over time,
you are getting worse.

1253
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,760
It's a problem.
That's all it is.

1254
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,520
It's a problem
with no solution.

1255
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,279
And that's what I do,
I solve problems.

1256
01:36:10,359 --> 01:36:11,920
That's what I do best.
This isn't math.

1257
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,680
You can't come up
with a formula...

1258
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,640
to change the way
you experience the world.

1259
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:18,399
- All I have to do is apply my mind.
- There's no theorem, no proof.

1260
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:21,039
- You can't reason
your way out of this.
- Why not? Why can't l?

1261
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:23,800
Because your mind
is where the problem is
in the first place.

1262
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,840
I can do this.

1263
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,399
I can work it out.
All I need is time.

1264
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:36,680
Is that the baby?

1265
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:40,760
The baby's at my mother's, John.

1266
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,680
Without treatment, John,

1267
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,600
the fantasies
may take over...

1268
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,039
entirely.

1269
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:20,319
You almost ready?

1270
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:24,479
Rosen's waiting outside.

1271
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:27,119
I can't go back
to that hospital.

1272
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,920
I won't come home.

1273
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:38,439
He said that
if you said that,

1274
01:37:39,159 --> 01:37:42,760
he has commitment
papers for me to sign.

1275
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:46,720
Well, maybe you
won't sign them.

1276
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:50,439
Maybe you'll just
give me some time.

1277
01:37:53,239 --> 01:37:55,159
I will try
to figure this out.

1278
01:37:57,439 --> 01:37:59,199
Whatever you do,

1279
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:02,439
Rosen is right
about one thing.

1280
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,920
You shouldn't be here.

1281
01:38:07,239 --> 01:38:09,079
I'm not safe anymore.

1282
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,439
Would you have
hurt me, John?

1283
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:27,039
I don't know.

1284
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:31,600
Maybe you should let
Dr. Rosen drive you
to your mother's.

1285
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:38,199
Rosen said to call if you try
and kill me or anything.

1286
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,079
You want to know
what's real?

1287
01:40:01,319 --> 01:40:03,199
This.

1288
01:40:10,199 --> 01:40:12,079
This.

1289
01:40:17,159 --> 01:40:19,000
This.

1290
01:40:20,359 --> 01:40:22,439
This is real.

1291
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:27,920
Maybe the part...

1292
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,279
that knows the waking
from the dream,

1293
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,479
maybe it isn't here.

1294
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,560
Maybe it's here.

1295
01:40:44,039 --> 01:40:46,279
I need to believe...

1296
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:49,640
that something
extraordinary is possible.

1297
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,520
Come.

1298
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:01,439
Hello, Martin.

1299
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,000
Jesus Christ.

1300
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,159
No. I-

1301
01:42:11,239 --> 01:42:14,159
I don't have that one.
My savior complex...

1302
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:15,600
takes on a completely
different form.

1303
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:20,359
I heard what happened
and well,

1304
01:42:20,439 --> 01:42:22,760
I- I wanted to write
and I tried you at MacArthur's...

1305
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:24,840
but you'd left, and I just...

1306
01:42:36,439 --> 01:42:38,399
This is Helinger's old office.

1307
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:40,000
Yeah.

1308
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:42,479
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1309
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,119
Seems that you won
after all, Martin.

1310
01:42:48,439 --> 01:42:51,279
They were wrong, John.
No one wins.

1311
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:53,960
Please, please have a seat.

1312
01:42:54,039 --> 01:42:56,840
God, it's so good
to see you.

1313
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,159
What brings you
back to Princeton?

1314
01:43:01,239 --> 01:43:02,560
John?

1315
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,680
John, I'm sorry,
but you have to tell him.

1316
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,760
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!

1317
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,359
Tell him your work is critical.

1318
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:11,600
John, please!

1319
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:28,039
Is there any chance
that you could ignore
what I just did?

1320
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:32,399
Of course,
what are old friends for?

1321
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:35,960
Is that what we are, Martin?
Friends?

1322
01:43:36,039 --> 01:43:38,039
John, of course.

1323
01:43:38,119 --> 01:43:40,760
Of course.
We always have been.

1324
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,600
Alicia and I think that-

1325
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,439
that fitting in,

1326
01:43:49,479 --> 01:43:51,399
being part of a community,

1327
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,279
might do me some good.

1328
01:43:55,359 --> 01:43:57,159
That a certain level
of attachment,

1329
01:43:57,239 --> 01:43:59,159
familiar places,
familiar people,

1330
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,279
might help me...

1331
01:44:02,359 --> 01:44:04,760
elbow out these-

1332
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:10,800
these certain delusions
that I have.

1333
01:44:15,319 --> 01:44:17,840
It's a lot to ask,
and now that I'm here,

1334
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,199
I'm quite certain
that you will just say no.

1335
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:28,079
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.

1336
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:37,840
Huh.

1337
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,800
Will you be needing an office?

1338
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,720
No.

1339
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:55,199
No, I could just work
out of the library.

1340
01:44:55,279 --> 01:44:57,720
Well, this guy tries
to wander into the library,

1341
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:00,840
but he doesn't have I.D.
Why can't people read
their memos, huh?

1342
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,560
Then he goes
totally nuts.

1343
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:04,800
Not real! You're not real.

1344
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,640
There's no mission.

1345
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,920
Oh, shit. Shit.

1346
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,560
Not real!
You are not real!

1347
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,439
Is this what you are, soldier?

1348
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:15,720
Some useless ghoul?

1349
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,720
The local madman?

1350
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,319
I'm not a soldier.
You're gonna end up
in a cell!

1351
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:22,560
Old, worthless,
discarded.

1352
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:23,800
There's no mission.

1353
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:25,439
And while you rock
and drool,

1354
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,000
the world will
burn to ashes!

1355
01:45:27,079 --> 01:45:29,439
You are not real!
You are not real!

1356
01:45:29,479 --> 01:45:31,079
You're still talking
to me, soldier.

1357
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:34,319
There's no mission!
I'm not a soldier!

1358
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:35,960
John? John?

1359
01:45:36,039 --> 01:45:37,800
John, John, John, John.

1360
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,199
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

1361
01:45:39,239 --> 01:45:40,720
John, John!
It's okay.

1362
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,840
I just heard what happened,
I'm sorry. John-

1363
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,000
I'm not a soldier.
John. Hey, Nash.

1364
01:45:45,079 --> 01:45:48,359
Nash, hey.
Hey, you're all right.

1365
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,880
Nash, Nash,
hey, hey, hey.

1366
01:45:55,479 --> 01:45:58,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1367
01:45:58,319 --> 01:45:59,439
John?

1368
01:46:01,479 --> 01:46:04,000
You should've seen their faces.

1369
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:06,720
Everybody was
just staring at me.

1370
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,319
John...

1371
01:46:08,399 --> 01:46:11,439
you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1372
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,640
I know.

1373
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,800
But then,
on the way home,

1374
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:20,600
Charles was there.

1375
01:46:24,279 --> 01:46:27,479
Sometimes, I really miss
talking to him.

1376
01:46:30,279 --> 01:46:32,560
Maybe Rosen's right.

1377
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:36,000
Maybe I have to think
about going back into
the hospital again.

1378
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:37,960
No.

1379
01:46:38,039 --> 01:46:40,199
Come here.

1380
01:46:43,399 --> 01:46:46,119
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1381
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:12,479
John, now, you can't
ignore me forever.

1382
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,680
Charles, you've been
a very good friend to me.

1383
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,359
The best.

1384
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,640
But I won't talk to you again.

1385
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,960
I just can't.

1386
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,399
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1387
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,479
Good-bye.

1388
01:47:54,359 --> 01:47:56,119
Good-bye.

1389
01:48:09,479 --> 01:48:11,880
I was wondering if I might
audit your course.

1390
01:48:13,239 --> 01:48:16,119
It's- It's an honor,
Professor Nash.

1391
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,199
Is something wrong?

1392
01:48:22,439 --> 01:48:24,640
This will be
my first class.

1393
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,399
Good morning,

1394
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:32,600
eager young minds.

1395
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,800
It's never
gonna work, John.

1396
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,279
You're just
humiliating yourself.

1397
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:00,800
It's pathetic!

1398
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,840
You are being
pathetic.

1399
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,840
I'm ashamed of you.

1400
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,920
Oh, man!

1401
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:39,399
Are you coming?
You're gonna be late.

1402
01:49:42,079 --> 01:49:43,840
Dad, you've got my books.
What?

1403
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,479
You've got my books.

1404
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:47,880
Oh, right.

1405
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,319
Thanks.

1406
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:51,960
Good-bye.
Bye.

1407
01:49:52,039 --> 01:49:53,760
See you tonight.

1408
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,720
Bye, honey.

1409
01:51:24,439 --> 01:51:25,960
Did you just solve Reimann?

1410
01:51:26,039 --> 01:51:28,119
Well, what
do you think?

1411
01:51:28,199 --> 01:51:31,119
Huh.
That's an analog
to Frobenius...

1412
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,079
for noncommutative
extensions.

1413
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:36,399
Yes, it is.

1414
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:39,319
But it only appears
to work sporadically, so, no.

1415
01:51:39,399 --> 01:51:41,439
But...

1416
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,720
I believe I'm
making progress.

1417
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:46,600
You're-

1418
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:49,399
You're John Nash, right?

1419
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:53,760
Toby Kelly.
Hello.

1420
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,560
I've been studying
your equilibrium.

1421
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:57,560
The one you wrote
here, at Princeton.

1422
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:00,039
To come up with something
totally original, the way you did.

1423
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:01,479
You know, I was young.

1424
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,039
Umm...

1425
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:05,399
I've been developing
a theory.

1426
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:21,199
I believe I can prove...

1427
01:52:21,279 --> 01:52:23,920
that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

1428
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,279
That everything,
everything is connected.

1429
01:52:26,359 --> 01:52:28,920
That it's all part
of the same subject.

1430
01:52:30,079 --> 01:52:31,880
When was the last time
you ate?

1431
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:34,399
Excuse me?
You know, food.

1432
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:36,359
Oh, uh-

1433
01:52:36,439 --> 01:52:38,319
My wife,

1434
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:40,159
she loves mayonnaise.

1435
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:43,359
Oh, thank you.

1436
01:52:43,399 --> 01:52:44,560
Thank you.

1437
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:47,359
Go on.

1438
01:52:47,399 --> 01:52:49,399
The function...

1439
01:52:49,479 --> 01:52:51,359
is in the two categories.
Um-hmm.

1440
01:52:55,359 --> 01:52:56,920
Alicia!

1441
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,560
Alicia!

1442
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:02,720
...coming together
at maximum speed of...

1443
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:04,760
Let us say
10milesperhour.

1444
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:08,000
So you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle B,

1445
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:10,920
and the fly, who can travel
at20milesan hour,

1446
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,560
leaves the tire
of bicycle B and it flies...

1447
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:14,680
to the tire of bicycle A
and backwards and forwards...

1448
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:17,000
and so on and so forth
until the two bikes collide...

1449
01:53:17,079 --> 01:53:18,760
and the poor little fly
is squashed.

1450
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:20,880
- This is the important thing...

1451
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,920
about actually focusing in
and comprehending...

1452
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,920
the area that you're
dealing with.

1453
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,720
Mathematics is very specific,
and it is an art form,

1454
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:30,000
no matter what these
people around here
will tell you,

1455
01:53:30,079 --> 01:53:31,439
especially the people
from biology.

1456
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,000
Don't listen to any
of those people.

1457
01:53:33,079 --> 01:53:35,279
Let me go back
to what you were doing before.

1458
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:38,520
I might want to steal this,
write a book and get famous.

1459
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,800
I was thinking
that I might teach.

1460
01:53:43,159 --> 01:53:45,159
A classroom
with 50 students...

1461
01:53:45,239 --> 01:53:48,079
can be daunting
for anyone.

1462
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:50,880
John, besides,
you're a terrible
teacher.

1463
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,720
I'm an acquired
taste, Martin.

1464
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:57,600
I was hoping there still
might be something
I could contribute.

1465
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,560
What about the-

1466
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,640
Well, you know.

1467
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:03,960
Are they gone?

1468
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:12,520
No, they're not gone.

1469
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:14,119
And maybe they
never will be.

1470
01:54:14,199 --> 01:54:15,880
But I've gotten used
to ignoring them...

1471
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:19,199
and I think as a result
they've kind of given up on me.

1472
01:54:19,279 --> 01:54:21,119
You think that's
what it's like...

1473
01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:24,720
with all our dreams
and our nightmares, Martin?

1474
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:27,720
You've got to keep
feeding them for them
to stay alive?

1475
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:31,119
John, they-
haunt you, though.

1476
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:35,720
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody's haunted by their past.

1477
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,479
Well, good-bye.

1478
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,880
John, I'll talk
to the department.

1479
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,520
Maybe
in the spring.

1480
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:53,640
Hey, Nash?

1481
01:54:55,239 --> 01:54:59,119
You- You scared?

1482
01:55:01,479 --> 01:55:03,359
Terrified.

1483
01:55:03,399 --> 01:55:05,680
Mortified.
Petrified.

1484
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:08,359
Stupefied by you.

1485
01:55:08,439 --> 01:55:09,760
Now you ought best
ring Alicia,

1486
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:11,800
or you're gonna get me...
I'll ring her.

1487
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:13,159
in an awful
lot of trouble.

1488
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,600
Thanks, Professor.
Good-bye.

1489
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:20,520
Have a nice day.
Good-bye.

1490
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:23,359
Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.

1491
01:55:23,399 --> 01:55:25,319
Professor Nash?

1492
01:55:28,439 --> 01:55:30,920
Can you see him?
Yeah.

1493
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,520
You sure?
Uh-huh.

1494
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,680
Positive?
He's within your vision?

1495
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,279
- Okay. Good.

1496
01:55:36,359 --> 01:55:39,239
Forgive me, I'm just
always suspicious of new people.

1497
01:55:39,319 --> 01:55:41,560
See you next week,
Professor.
See you next week.

1498
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,359
So now that I know
that you're real,

1499
01:55:44,439 --> 01:55:46,800
who are you,
and what can I
do for you?

1500
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:50,119
Professor, my name
is Thomas King...

1501
01:55:50,199 --> 01:55:51,279
Thomas King?
Mm-hm.

1502
01:55:51,359 --> 01:55:52,760
and I'm here
to tell you...

1503
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:55,760
that you're
being considered
for the Nobel Prize.

1504
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,600
Forgive me, but I'm just
a little stunned.

1505
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:08,039
Over the past few years
your equilibrium...

1506
01:56:08,119 --> 01:56:10,600
has become a cornerstone
of modern economics.

1507
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:12,840
Suddenly everybody
likes that one.

1508
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:17,039
What about my work
on other some such projects-
manifold embedding?

1509
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:20,199
The application
of your bargaining problem...

1510
01:56:20,279 --> 01:56:24,399
to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases-

1511
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:26,119
Antitrust cases?
Yes.

1512
01:56:26,199 --> 01:56:28,399
I never would have
considered that.

1513
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:30,000
Well...
Have I just reached...

1514
01:56:30,079 --> 01:56:32,680
some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1515
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:34,560
No, no, you haven't.

1516
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:36,560
'Cause, I wouldn't
have thought of that.

1517
01:56:41,479 --> 01:56:43,479
Shall we have tea?

1518
01:56:45,359 --> 01:56:47,600
Oh, I don't go in there.
I usually just...

1519
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:49,479
take my sandwich
in the library.

1520
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:53,359
Come on, John.
Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.

1521
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:55,399
M-Most-

1522
01:56:55,479 --> 01:56:57,279
Most commercially
available brands of tea...

1523
01:56:57,359 --> 01:56:58,920
are not suitable
to my palate.

1524
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,640
I'm not-

1525
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:03,720
There are some
Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough-

1526
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:06,279
I enjoy the flavor
that they have-

1527
01:57:06,359 --> 01:57:08,000
I have not been
in this room...

1528
01:57:08,079 --> 01:57:10,960
for some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.

1529
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,119
Why, thank you,
young lady.

1530
01:57:16,399 --> 01:57:18,640
Things have certainly
changed around here.

1531
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,880
I have a son that age.

1532
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,800
Harvard.

1533
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,880
Hmm.

1534
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,399
I would have thought
the nominations...

1535
01:57:31,479 --> 01:57:33,840
for the Nobel Prize
would have been secret.

1536
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,600
I would have thought
you'd only find out...

1537
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:37,199
if you won or lost.

1538
01:57:37,279 --> 01:57:39,359
That is generally
the case, yes.

1539
01:57:39,439 --> 01:57:41,479
But these are
special circumstances.

1540
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,960
The awards
are substantial.

1541
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,359
They require
private funding.
As such,

1542
01:57:49,439 --> 01:57:52,279
the image
of the Nobel is...

1543
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,439
I see. You came here
to find out if I was crazy?

1544
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:59,840
Find out if I would...

1545
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,800
screw everything up
if I actually won?

1546
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:06,279
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and squawk
like a chicken,

1547
01:58:06,359 --> 01:58:07,680
things of this nature?

1548
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:10,119
Something
like that, yes.

1549
01:58:11,079 --> 01:58:13,000
Would I
embarrass you?

1550
01:58:16,399 --> 01:58:18,439
Yes, it is possible.

1551
01:58:21,079 --> 01:58:23,079
You see, l-

1552
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:26,000
I am crazy.

1553
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:30,000
I take the newer
medications,

1554
01:58:33,279 --> 01:58:36,119
but I still see things
that are not here.

1555
01:58:38,279 --> 01:58:40,399
I just choose
not to acknowledge them.

1556
01:58:42,439 --> 01:58:44,199
Like a diet of the mind,

1557
01:58:44,279 --> 01:58:46,600
I choose not to indulge
certain appetites.

1558
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:51,680
Like my appetite
for patterns.

1559
01:58:53,239 --> 01:58:57,039
Perhaps my appetite
to imagine and to dream.

1560
01:58:58,039 --> 01:58:59,880
Professor Nash.

1561
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:07,119
It's good to have
you here, John.

1562
01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:09,039
Thank you.

1563
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:17,319
It's an honor, sir.
Thank you very much.

1564
01:59:17,399 --> 01:59:19,000
A privilege,
Professor.

1565
01:59:23,159 --> 01:59:24,560
Professor.

1566
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:32,600
Nicely done, John.
Thank you, Tom.

1567
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:35,399
Thank you.

1568
01:59:35,479 --> 01:59:38,039
Thank you.

1569
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,039
Thank you, Ed.

1570
01:59:55,319 --> 01:59:58,119
That was certainly
most unexpected.

1571
02:00:18,279 --> 02:00:20,439
Thank you.

1572
02:00:24,359 --> 02:00:26,600
I've always believed in numbers.

1573
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:29,119
In the equations and logics...

1574
02:00:29,199 --> 02:00:31,039
that lead to reason.

1575
02:00:31,119 --> 02:00:33,920
But after a lifetime
of such pursuits,

1576
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:36,359
I ask,

1577
02:00:36,439 --> 02:00:38,880
what truly is logic?

1578
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:41,960
Who decides reason?

1579
02:00:43,359 --> 02:00:46,640
My quest has taken me
through the physical,

1580
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:48,520
the metaphysical,

1581
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,800
the delusional...

1582
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,800
and back.

1583
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:59,520
And I have made
the most important
discovery of my career.

1584
02:01:01,399 --> 02:01:04,560
The most important discovery
of my life.

1585
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:10,359
It is only in the mysterious
equations of love...

1586

1
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:42,370
Help!
Me house is on fire!
Me house is on fire!

2
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:50,294
Call the fire brigade!

3
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,298
Don't worry. Come along.
Hurry up. Hurry up.

4
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,176
Well done, lads!

5
00:02:57,261 --> 00:02:59,303
Fill 'em up!

6
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:01,597
Pass the buckets!

7
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:04,559
There must be another way
of doing the credits.

8
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:06,561
That's right!

9
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:10,940
Every time they make
a Robin Hood movie,
they burn our village down.

10
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,953
Leave us alone,
Mel Brooks!

11
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,496
Yeah.

12
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,000
Yeah.

13
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,168
Yo, yo, yo!
Check it out.

14
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:33,921
Prince John and the sheriff
They was runnin' the show

15
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,007
Raisin' the taxes
'cause they needed the dough

16
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:38,426
A reign of terror
took over the land

17
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:40,636
They were
shakin' down the people
just to beat the band

18
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,930
I said hey
Hey

19
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,391
I said hey
Hey

20
00:03:45,517 --> 00:03:47,894
I said
Hey, nonny, nonny
and a ho-ho-ho

21
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,192
The people were unhappy
Morale was low

22
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:57,653
They had no place to turn to
There was nowhere to go

23
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,114
They needed a hero
but no one could be found

24
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,284
'Cause Robin Hood
was out of town
I said hey

25
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:04,785
Hey

26
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,662
I said hey
Hey

27
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:11,208
I said
Hey, nonny, nonny
and a ho-ho-ho

28
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:17,048
He was put into the slammer
by his Arab foe

29
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,926
And in a little while
he would be no more
I said hey

30
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,261
- Hey
- I said hey

31
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,805
Hey
I said

32
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,807
Hey, nonny, nonny
Hey, nonny, nonny

33
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,685
Hey, nonny, nonny
and a whoa, whoa, whoa

34
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,646
Check it out

35
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:56,671
Ow!
Ow!

36
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,474
Ah, hello, hello!

37
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,727
Welcome, welcome
to le dungeon!

38
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:18,734
Hello, I'm Falafel,
maître d' dungeon.

39
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,612
Please allow me to show you
to your cell. Come.

40
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,410
Duck.

41
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,453
I always forget
about that.

42
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,915
I'm so sorry,
but we cannot seat you
without the proper attire.

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,459
- See?
-

44
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:39,588
Irving.

45
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,092
Help me.

46
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,803
Ah!
That's much better.

47
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,764
And now I leave you
in the capable hands
of Muktar.

48
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:52,101
He's our head guard.

49
00:05:52,227 --> 00:05:55,521
Please, it's better
you cooperate with him.

50
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,523
He's a tough guy.

51
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,027
And if there’s anything
you require, please don't
hesitate to scream.

52
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:04,030
Coming!

53
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,490
We're so busy!

54
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:09,035
Follow me!

55
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:14,915
Please sit.

56
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:22,965
Robin of Loxley,
where is your king?

57
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:25,968
King? King?

58
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,970
And which king
might that be?

59
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:31,515
King Richard, King Louis,
King Kong?

60
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,517
Larry King?

61
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:38,147
Impertinent English dog!
You shall talk.

62
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,941
I don't think so.

63
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:44,445
Chuchim, please,

64
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,405
the tongue looseners.

65
00:06:51,787 --> 00:06:53,704
Speak, you dog.

66
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,082
Speak!
Uh-uh.

67
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:02,088
Ooh!

68
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,177
What did he say?

69
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,429
You don't wanna know.

70
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,150
You very brave
for a not-at-homeboy.

71
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,277
Oh, thank you.

72
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:29,365
I've been in this place
for a while. Perhaps I can
be of some service to you.

73
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:33,285
- Do you have any questions?
- What are you in for?

74
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:38,249
-Jaywalking.
- Oh. I see.

75
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,634
It's not gonna be easy
getting out of here.

76
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:51,971
What we need
is a great feat
of strength.

77
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,140
Feat of strength?

78
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,433
Au contraire!

79
00:07:56,518 --> 00:08:01,564
Now that you are here
with me, what we have
is great strength of feet!

80
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,652
- Don't follow.
- Do as I do.

81
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,530
Put your feet on the bar,
both feet.

82
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,492
Now, on the count
of kick—

83
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,995
Kick!
Ha-ha!

84
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,917
- What was that noise?
- Uh, noise? Noise?

85
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,919
Uh— Uh, uh, uh, uh-

86
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:27,089
The noise you heard
was the breaking
of this poor man's heart.

87
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,049
Yes, that's it!
Ohh!

88
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:33,345
- What?
- He's decided to save his
life by betraying his king.

89
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,599
- Tsk, tsk, tsk.
- Oh, yes, that's it.

90
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,809
Oh, damn my eyes.

91
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:42,354
So go. Go tell your superiors
before he changes his mind.

92
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:45,107
Oh, by the love of Allah,
this is a wonderful thing!

93
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:47,568
Go.

94
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,196
It will mean
a big promotion for me.

95
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,406
Go!

96
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,700
Good news
is always rewarded!

97
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,203
Please go.

98
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,086
- On the other hand-
-

99
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,132
bad news
is severely punished.

100
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,134
Aah!

101
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,721
Now is our chance.

102
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,600
Quick, follow me!

103
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,519
You get that chain,
I'll get this one.
Righto!

104
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,942
We're free!

105
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,364
We're free!
We're going home!

106
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:41,914
Move out of the way!

107
00:09:47,796 --> 00:09:51,257
Come on.
Take my hand.

108
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,139
All right,
on the count of three!

109
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:02,101
One, two, three!

110
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:15,155
I just told them
the good news, and-

111
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,157
and-

112
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,203
and I'm in deep shit.

113
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,889
It is a very long journey
from Africa to England,
my friend.

114
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,850
Well.

115
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:45,519
I owe you a great debt
of gratitude, my friend.

116
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,521
I am called
Robin of Loxley.

117
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,566
My name is Asneeze,
father of Ahchoo.

118
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,776
Bless you.
No, no, no, no, no.

119
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:56,280
Ahchoo is my son.
He's in England,
your country.

120
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,449
He's an exchange student.

121
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:00,951
I'd like you
to look after him.

122
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:05,748
He's in need of guidance.
He is headstrong and cocksure.

123
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,293
Or is it
the other way around?

124
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,838
Say no more.
I vow on the sacred word
of Loxley,

125
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:16,091
I give you
my undying pledge,
my solemn oath...

126
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:19,219
on my father's honor,
on the blood of my heart,

127
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,263
on the word of my soul-
Good.

128
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:23,932
on the very
center of my being,
that nothing shall—

129
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,436
You must go now,
or you will miss the tide.

130
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,773
Yes, yes.
Well, farewell,
my friend.

131
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,318
And not to worry.
I'll find Ahchoo.

132
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:37,571
Good-bye, my friend.
Farewell.

133
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,074
Safe journey!

134
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:16,485
Home! Home!

135
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,155
England! Ahh!

136
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,410
Mmm! Mwah!

137
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,966
Oh, a horse. A horse.
My kingdom for a horse.

138
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,901
Get him!

139
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,824
Hold him.

140
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,119
Ahchoo?

141
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,163
Bless you!

142
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,669
Man, I hope someone's getting
a video of this thing.

143
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,883
- Damn!
-

144
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,843
That must be him.

145
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,726
Watch my back!

146
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:36,315
Your back just
got punched twice.

147
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,984
Thank you.

148
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,619
Hey, thanks, man.
You're welcome.

149
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,663
Who are you anyway?

150
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,082
I think now is not the time
for introductions.

151
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,084
Time out!

152
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,755
Excuse me, bad guys.
I am running out of air.

153
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,798
Gotta get pumped.

154
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,179
Huh?
Huh?

155
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,391
Okay, honkies.
Time in!

156
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:16,730
By the by, do you know
praying mantis?

157
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,107
You're looking at him.

158
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:39,086
Let's get out of here!

159
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,088
Yeah, boy!

160
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,048
Go ahead, punk!

161
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,050
They're witches!
They're mad!

162
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:47,302
They're possessed!
They're crazy!

163
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:51,932
Good work.
Thanks, man.

164
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,981
You haven't seen
the last of us!

165
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,996
You've seen the last of us.

166
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,884
There she is, Loxley Hall,

167
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,554
home of my family
for seven generations.

168
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:33,140
Let's go!

169
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,934
Move it!
Come on. Let's go!

170
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:38,145
That's it, boys.
Let's go. Move it.

171
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,772
That's it!
Keep it going!

172
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,774
Keep it going!

173
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:46,153
Yes, come on, come on.
Move it, move it.

174
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,739
Here we go.
Stop the castle!
Stop the castle!

175
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:54,745
You there!
I demand to know what
is going on here!

176
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,788
Read it and weep.

177
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,543
Hey, what up
with that?

178
00:16:01,628 --> 00:16:03,462
"Hear ye, hear ye.

179
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,881
"For failure
to pay back taxes,

180
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,884
"all the lands,
castle and properties
of the family of Loxley...

181
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,886
"shall be taken
in lieu of payment.

182
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,222
Signed, Prince John's
royal accountant,
H.M.R. Blockhead"?

183
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,224
This is a sham!

184
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,894
I vow here and now
I will restore my castle
to its rightful place.

185
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,563
Yeah, yeah.
You vow, we move!

186
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,608
Let's go, boys!
Take it out!

187
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:32,741
So long!
Move it!

188
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,495
Keep it going!
Come on!

189
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,497
That's a boy!

190
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,263
Blinkin?

191
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:57,724
Who's that?
It's Blinkin.

192
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,310
Our family's
loyal, blind servant.

193
00:17:02,063 --> 00:17:04,731
I gotta get
the horse, man.
Good.

194
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,859
Blinkin!
Uh, be right out.

195
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,283
Blinkin!

196
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:17,994
Master Robin,
is that you?
Yes!

197
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:20,497
Back from
the Crusades?
Yes!

198
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:23,458
And alive?
Yes.

199
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,211
Oh, happy day!

200
00:17:28,131 --> 00:17:32,134
I'm quite sure
there was a door there.

201
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:35,721
Master Robin!

202
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,724
You lost your arms
in battle.

203
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:40,976
How— How terrible!

204
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,311
But you grew
some nice boobs.

205
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:45,313
Blinkin, I'm over here.

206
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,567
Oh. Uh, later.

207
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:52,446
Blinkin, listen to me.
They've taken the castle.

208
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:55,699
I thought it felt
a bit drafty.

209
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,701
Ohh!

210
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,455
This never would have happened
if your father was alive.

211
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:03,373
He's dead?

212
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,417
Yes.

213
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:08,712
And my mother?
She died of pneumonia
whilst—

214
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,964
Oh, you were away!

215
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,551
My brothers?
They were all killed
by the plague.

216
00:18:15,887 --> 00:18:17,804
My dog Pongo?

217
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:19,848
Run over by a carriage.

218
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,017
My goldfish Goldy?

219
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,311
Eaten by the cat.

220
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:28,064
My cat?
Choked on the goldfish.

221
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,612
Oh, it's good to be home,
ain't it, Master Robin?

222
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,989
Oh! Oooh!
Wait a minute.

223
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,033
Wait a minute.

224
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,035
What is that?

225
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,039
Oh, your father wanted me
to give you this.

226
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,875
He said that inside
is the key...

227
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,003
to the greatest treasure
in all the land.

228
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,881
Ohh.
May I keep it?

229
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,177
Um, no, Blinkin.
I think I ought to honor
my father's wishes.

230
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,471
Of course.

231
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:14,319
Come, Blinkin.
Let us leave this
depressing foundation.

232
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,030
We have much to do
and less time to do it in.

233
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,990
Yes.

234
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,035
Hey. Hey, Robin,
wait up.

235
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,704
Oh, well done, Ahchoo.

236
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:27,165
Yeah, he was running fast,
but I caught his ass.

237
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,710
Who's that?
Blinkin, I'd like you
to meet Ahchoo.

238
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:32,879
A Jew? Here?

239
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,549
No, no.
Not a Jew. Ahchoo.

240
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:38,593
Hey, put it there.
How do you do?

241
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,595
I've been better.

242
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,389
- What is that?
- Help me! Help me!

243
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:48,395
Aah, save me!
Save me!

244
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,068
Looks like a runaway
white boy.

245
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:57,863
All right. Steady on.
What's the matter?

246
00:19:57,989 --> 00:20:01,366
They're after me.
Who is?

247
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,967
Over that boy hand!

248
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,515
Hand over that boy.

249
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:30,228
Who demands it?
The sheriff
of Rottingham.

250
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,650
And what
has the boy done?

251
00:20:35,735 --> 00:20:38,153
He was caught poaching
in the king's forest.

252
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,323
He "deered"
to kill a king's dare.

253
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:46,286
Dared to kill a king's deer.

254
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,331
And this
is an offense?

255
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:53,877
One punishable by death.
Where have you been?

256
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,504
Fighting with King Richard
in the Crusades.

257
00:20:56,589 --> 00:21:00,300
Unfortunately,
my father couldn't get me
into the National Guard.

258
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:02,928
Whoa-oh!

259
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,264
How dare you talk to me
in that fashion?

260
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,309
Who are you?
I am Robin of Loxley.

261
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,311
Oh, yes, yes,
I've heard of you.

262
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,730
They say you're pretty handy
with a sword.

263
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,774
Let's find out!

264
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,998
I was angry at you
before, Loxley,

265
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,877
but now I'm really
pissed off!
Pissed off?

266
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,088
If I was that close
to a horse's wiener,

267
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,924
I'd be worried about
getting pissed on.

268
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,928
You know, this wasn't
a very smart thing for you
to have done, Loxley.

269
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,972
I'll pay for this!

270
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,352
You'll pay for this!

271
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,271
Kill them!

272
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,111
Wait, I've...
changed my mind.

273
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,905
Wise decision.

274
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:08,159
So, until we meet again,

275
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,245
have a safe journey.

276
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,956
Ooh! Ooh! Ow!
Oh! Ah!

277
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,000
Mind the big rocks!

278
00:22:19,714 --> 00:22:23,633
Shut up, you bloody fools!

279
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:26,594
Good riddance
to bad rubbish.

280
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:31,099
Oh, thank you
for saving me life,
milord.

281
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,768
I shall tell all that I see
that there is one man
in England...

282
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,271
who's not afraid to
stand up to Rottingham
and his men.

283
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,606
Good. Tell them that.

284
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,651
And tell them also
that I vow to put an end
to the injustice,

285
00:22:41,736 --> 00:22:44,279
right the wrongs,
end the tyranny,

286
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,699
restore the throne,
protect the forest,

287
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,618
introduce folk dancing,

288
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,787
demand a four-day
work week...

289
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:55,582
and affordable health care
for Saxons and Normans.

290
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:59,502
Yes, yes. Good, good.
Well, it's getting dark.

291
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,504
I gotta go home
alone now.

292
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,715
Right, right.
Good-bye.

293
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:12,307
What an unusual child.

294
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,266
Hmm.

295
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,482
Where is the one

296
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:24,986
That I love most of all

297
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,490
When will I hear him call

298
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:32,410
Marian, Marian

299
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,497
He is the one

300
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:39,918
Who can make my life whole

301
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:45,423
Joyful forevermore

302
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:49,094
I've waited so patiently

303
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,847
For a true love

304
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,518
When will he come for me

305
00:23:56,602 --> 00:24:00,438
Where is he
Where is he, oh

306
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,197
Where is the man

307
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:13,827
Who carries the key

308
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:16,287
When will he be

309
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:19,374
With his Marian

310
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,459
Marian

311
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:24,504
I cannot wait

312
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:28,716
Till he sets my heart free

313
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:33,388
Oh, when will I know him

314
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,392
When will I see him

315
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:41,229
When will I hear him

316
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,314
Say Marian

317
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:47,777
My love

318
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,072
Oh!

319
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:53,408
Hurry up, mein lady!

320
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,494
You better get out
of that tub...

321
00:24:56,579 --> 00:24:59,330
before that thing
begins to rust.

322
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:01,791
All right, Broomhilde.

323
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:08,214
Hurry, hurry.
It's freezing.

324
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,764
Button up.
You're going to catch
your death of cold.

325
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,893
Oh, these castles
are so drafty.

326
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,149
Toasty warm.

327
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:30,904
Oh, Broomhilde, look.

328
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,489
A happy little bluebird.

329
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,205
Hello.

330
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:45,835
Ah. This means
I must make a wish.

331
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,588
I hope against hope,

332
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,798
I wish against wish...

333
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:54,928
that the heavens bring me
a kind, wonderful, gentle man...

334
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:58,139
who possesses the key
to my...

335
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,018
heart.

336
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:04,812
Good-bye,
my little friend.

337
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,941
Ooh, that happy
little bluebird...

338
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:11,236
has left a happy
little doo-doo on your hand.

339
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:29,003
Prince John,
I must speak with you.

340
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:32,674
All right, everybody.
Later, later.

341
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,301
See you later.
Oh!

342
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,183
Sire.

343
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,185
I have news.

344
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,896
What sort of news
do you have?

345
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:49,899
Not bad news, is it?
You know I can't take
bad news.

346
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:54,362
The day started out so good.
Had a good night's sleep.
Had a good B.M.

347
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,614
I don't want to hear
any bad news.

348
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,700
Now, what type
of news is it?

349
00:26:58,784 --> 00:27:01,786
Well, to be perfectly frank,
it's bad!

350
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,872
I knew it!

351
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:08,376
I knew it was bad news!

352
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,006
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.

353
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:17,802
Maybe if you tell me
the bad news in a good way,
it won't sound so bad.

354
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,473
The bad— The bad news
in a good way?

355
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:25,476
Yes, I can do that.
Bad news in a good way.

356
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,478
Um— Well, here goes.

357
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:34,986
Wait till you hear this.
I just bumped into
Robin of Loxley.

358
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,905
He's back from the Crusades.

359
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,493
You know,
he just beat the crap
out of me and my men.

360
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:49,167
He— He hates you,
and he loves
your brother Richard.

361
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,297
And-

362
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:00,428
he wants to
see you hanged!

363
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:03,348
You-

364
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:06,851
We're— We're—
We're in an awful lot
of trouble!

365
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:13,107
What, are you crazy?

366
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:16,527
Why are you laughing?
This is terrible news!

367
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:19,364
Well, I-I-
You-You told me-

368
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:21,616
I was just trying
to soften the blow.

369
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,369
Well, you blew it.

370
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,788
This is a knotty problem,
sire, not easily solved.

371
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,790
Yes, you're right.

372
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:32,043
What to do?

373
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:35,213
What to do?
What to do?

374
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:39,217
Got it! Latrine!

375
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:40,093
The weird creature
in the tower, the one
who protects my future.

376
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:43,471
The weird creature
in the tower, the one
who protects my future.

377
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,973
Oh, yes, Latrine.

378
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,934
Is she ugly!

379
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:56,359
Latrine? Latrine,
where are you?
I must talk with you!

380
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,820
Latrine! Latrine!
No!

381
00:28:58,904 --> 00:29:02,657
Oh, it's you.
There's a new threat
to my power.

382
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:06,494
What can you tell me
about Robin of Loxley?

383
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,664
Robin of Loxley?
Robin of Loxley.

384
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,833
Let me see.

385
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,003
Raven's egg,

386
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,339
blood of a hen!

387
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,299
Little bit more blood,
yes.

388
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,679
Eyeballs of a crocodile.

389
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,350
Testicles of a newt.

390
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,437
I guess he's
a transsexual now!

391
00:29:32,563 --> 00:29:35,273
Yeah. Ugh.
Yes.

392
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,572
Mmm!

393
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,368
Robin of Loxley
is handsome and brave.

394
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:51,205
He seeks to regain
his family's honor.

395
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,417
The little sod
could be trouble.

396
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:56,419
Are you certain?
Certain?

397
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:59,755
You want certain,
hire yourself a witch.
I'm just your cook.

398
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,467
Here. Eat this.

399
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,887
Hmm, looks fabulous.

400
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:08,890
Looks like a seder
at Vincent Price's house.

401
00:30:16,482 --> 00:30:20,318
Such an unusual name, Latrine.
How did your family
come by it?

402
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:22,987
We changed it
in the ninth century.

403
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,698
You mean,
you changed it...

404
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,992
to Latrine?

405
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,453
Yeah.
Used to be Shithouse.

406
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:34,582
It's a good change.

407
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,668
It's a good change.

408
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:41,631
Now, what about
this Robin fellow, huh?

409
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:44,091
How can I stop him?

410
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,928
Maybe I could devise...

411
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,930
a magic potion,

412
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:52,600
one that would make him
unable to perform
the slightest task.

413
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,021
But in return,
you must help me.

414
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:01,275
What, are you kidding?
Name it. Anything you want.

415
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,071
Put in a good word
for me with the sheriff
of Rottingham.

416
00:31:05,155 --> 00:31:07,573
I've got the hots for him.

417
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,202
Hmm.

418
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,664
I keep a likeness of him
in my boudoir.

419
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,916
Oh. Ohh!

420
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,460
Oh! Oh, Rotty!

421
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:22,380
Rotty, Rotty, Rotty!

422
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:24,507
I am amazed,

423
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,635
to think that a handsome
blade like the sheriff
of Rottingham...

424
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,596
would ever want
a creature like you.

425
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,269
Well, if you’re gonna
puncture my dreams,

426
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:39,063
you can forget about
my promise to help you.

427
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,817
No, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

428
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,819
Wait.

429
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,446
Maybe if we
got him drunk.

430
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,161
Very drunk.

431
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,163
You got a shot.

432
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:04,755
Ooh, good!

433
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,226
Whoa.

434
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,315
Dismount.

435
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,281
Wait here.
I'll go make sure
it's safe.

436
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:52,345
I say, would you mind,
um, awfully,
getting out of the way?

437
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,223
I say, not until
you pay the toll.

438
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,434
Toll? What toll?

439
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:02,229
Well, the toll you pay
for crossing me bridge.

440
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,231
I'm not paying
any toll.

441
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,901
This bridge is
on my family's land.

442
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,903
Well, it used to be
my family's land.

443
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,448
Hey. Hey, you're—
you're Robin of Loxley!

444
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,450
Hey!

445
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,827
Yeah!

446
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:18,829
And who might you be?

447
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:21,082
Oh, they call me
Little John.

448
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,584
Uh, but don't let
my name fool you.

449
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,545
In real life,
I'm very big.

450
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,840
I'll take your word for it.
Now let me pass.

451
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:32,426
Uh- No.

452
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,722
Sorry,
but a toll is a toll,

453
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,724
and a roll is a roll,

454
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:42,186
and if we don't get no tolls,
then we don't eat no rolls.

455
00:33:43,689 --> 00:33:45,606
I made that up.

456
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,193
It's very fascinating.
I'm afraid I'm going
to have to hurt you.

457
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:52,822
Oh, yeah. My pleasure.
Will!

458
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,123
Thank you.

459
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:04,208
Hey, Blinkin.

460
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,335
Did you say,
"Abe Lincoln"?

461
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,630
No, I ain't
say Abe Lincoln!
I said, "Hey, Blinkin."

462
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:11,632
Hold the reins, man.

463
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,344
Damn.

464
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,472
Hey, Robin, Robin.

465
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,683
Excuse me.
No, excuse me.

466
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:23,227
Hey, look, man.
You don't have to do this.

467
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:27,815
Look, this ain't exactly
the Mississippi.

468
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,152
I'm on one side, see?
I'm on the other side.

469
00:34:31,236 --> 00:34:35,156
I'm on the east bank.
I'm on the west bank.

470
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,950
It is not that critical.

471
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:41,537
Not the point.
It's the principle
of the thing.

472
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,664
Yeah.

473
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,084
Nice knowing you.

474
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:23,871
Aah!

475
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,191
Ow.

476
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,527
Ow.

477
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,529
Ow!

478
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:00,825
Uh! Ho!

479
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:05,454
Help me!

480
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:07,456
I can't swim!

481
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:11,377
I'm drowning!
Oh, no, I'm drowning!

482
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:15,172
Help me!

483
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:17,925
Help me!

484
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,553
Help me! Help me!

485
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:24,807
Oh, God! Oh, I'm drowning!
I'm drowning, I'm drowning,
I'm drowning!

486
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,856
There, there.
You're all right now.

487
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:35,568
Thank you, Robin.
You saved me life.

488
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,029
What?
Air!

489
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:41,490
Sorry.

490
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,909
There.
I'm in your debit.

491
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:47,246
Think nothing of it.
Hey, are y'all
all right?

492
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,915
Huh. Let me introduce you
to my friends.

493
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,293
That is Blinkin.

494
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,295
And this is Ahchoo.

495
00:36:54,379 --> 00:36:56,297
Bless ya.

496
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,716
That's my name, man.

497
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,968
Ahchoo.

498
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,722
Here, let me introduce you
to my best friend,
Will Scarlet.

499
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,932
Scarlet's my middle name.

500
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:10,269
My full name is
Will Scarlet O'Hara.

501
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,691
We're from Georgia.

502
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,693
He's deadly
with his daggers.

503
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,487
Really? How's about
a demonstration?

504
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,531
Gladly.

505
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,169
All right then.

506
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:38,756
Fire an arrow
straight at my heart.

507
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,135
- Are you serious?
- Absolutely.

508
00:37:49,476 --> 00:37:51,810
Okay. Good-bye.

509
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,862
Hey, what part of Georgia
are you from?

510
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,822
South Central?

511
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:16,001
Well, I haven't quite
figured that part out yet.

512
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,214
I see.

513
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,050
I'm sorry 'bout
the toll thing, Robin.

514
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,052
I mean,
it's Prince John.

515
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,638
He's taken our homes
and everything we own.

516
00:38:27,764 --> 00:38:31,684
We've nothin' left.
Not to worry,
Little John.

517
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:35,688
Even as we speak, I'm forming
a plan to make trouble for
Prince John and Rottingham.

518
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,774
Tonight,
I'll crash their party
and serve warning...

519
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,527
that there are those who
will fight to rid England
of their tyranny.

520
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,822
Good! We'll join you!
Yeah!

521
00:38:44,906 --> 00:38:47,616
No, no, no, no.
I can't risk the lives
of others.

522
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:51,453
One man can
get in more easily
than half a dozen.

523
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:53,914
Well, I must be off.

524
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,750
Fare thee well.
I'll see thee
upon my return.

525
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:59,253
All right, man.
Peace, bro.

526
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,464
Take it easy.
Thanks.

527
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,597
Man, white men can’t jump.

528
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,523
Ah. Here you are, son.

529
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,525
Your ticket, sir.

530
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,480
Kill him!

531
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,400
No, wait.

532
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:07,154
You know, a mime...
is a terrible thing
to waste.

533
00:40:09,574 --> 00:40:11,533
Let him go.

534
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:19,583
Lovely Bristols.

535
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,585
Good evening, milady.

536
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:25,089
Milady.

537
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:33,138
Maid Marian, you know
our good sheriff
of Rottingham.

538
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,933
You look ravishing,
my dear.

539
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,566
Please allow me
to help you to your seat.

540
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,030
Mmm.

541
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,954
I must say that Prince John
has spared no expense
for tonight's party.

542
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,957
We have exotic foods
from across the seas.

543
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:03,502
Coconuts, bananas
and dates.

544
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,838
Would you care
for a date?
Yes, thank you.

545
00:41:05,922 --> 00:41:08,715
How 'bout
next Thursday?

546
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,389
Good evening.

547
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,933
That's-
That's him!

548
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,520
That's Loxley!

549
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:38,954
Greetings, Your Highness.

550
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:44,501
Traif.
A present for you
and your guests.

551
00:41:44,586 --> 00:41:46,503
That's a wild boar.

552
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:50,048
No, no, that's a wild pig.
That's a wild bore.

553
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:52,885
Funny!

554
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,887
Very amusing.

555
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,183
So you're Robin
of Loxley, huh?

556
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:04,980
I've heard so much
about you.

557
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,026
- And you are?
- Maid Marian.

558
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:11,904
Ah, Maid Marian.

559
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:14,865
Rumors of your beauty
have traveled
far and wide,

560
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:18,493
yet I see they hardly
do you justice.
Oh!

561
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:21,079
Quite a smoothy.

562
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:25,375
He's definitely a smoothy.
Enough!

563
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:29,129
King illegal forest...

564
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:33,467
to pig wild kill
in it a is!

565
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,510
What?
What?

566
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:39,181
I mean, don't you know
it is illegal
to kill a wild pig...

567
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,767
in the king's forest?

568
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:44,937
Is it not also illegal
to sit in the king's throne
and usurp his power...

569
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,814
in his absence?

570
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:51,151
Careful, Robin.
You go too far.
I've only just begun.

571
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:54,988
I've come to warn you
that if you do not stop
levying these evil taxes,

572
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:59,368
I shall lead
the good people of England
in a revolt against you.

573
00:42:59,452 --> 00:43:02,454
And why should the people
listen to you?

574
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:06,166
Because, unlike
some other Robin Hoods,

575
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:09,711
I can speak
with an English accent.

576
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:12,130
Oh!

577
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:16,218
To tell you the truth,
this guy is starting
to get on my nerves!

578
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,220
Worry not, Your Highness.

579
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:22,474
I shall dispose
of this feathered upstart.

580
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:25,686
I challenge you
to a duel.

581
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,740
I accept.

582
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:40,784
Whoa!

583
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:46,206
That's going to cost you,
Loxley.

584
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,333
Please,
put it on my bill.

585
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,753
So it's come down
to this, has it?
A fight to the death.

586
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:54,006
Mano a mano,

587
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,008
man to man,

588
00:43:56,092 --> 00:43:58,427
just you and me...

589
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:01,221
and my guards!

590
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,603
Ooh!

591
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:12,274
Check, please.
Table one.

592
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,329
Ha!

593
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,630
-
-

594
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:41,511
Uh. Ooh. Ah.

595
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,434
Hurry, let's
get out of here!

596
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:54,316
Oh.

597
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,492
Uhh.

598
00:45:19,634 --> 00:45:22,052
Refreshment, sir.
Ah, thank you, Blinkin.

599
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:26,932
Sounds like
we're winning, sir.

600
00:45:27,058 --> 00:45:28,975
Indeed, we are.
Carry on.
Right you are.

601
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:38,026
Save me, save me.
Hurt them, hurt them!

602
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:40,946
Yes, save them, save them.
Hurt you, hurt you.
I've got it.

603
00:45:41,030 --> 00:45:44,241
- Ohh!
-

604
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,088
Care for some dessert?

605
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:01,925
One, two, three!

606
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,553
Fire!

607
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,266
Maid Marian!

608
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,935
Do you believe in...
love at first sight?

609
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:16,648
Depends on what
you're looking at.

610
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:22,737
Well?
Yes! Yes! Yes!

611
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:28,160
Where is she?
Ohh!

612
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:30,162
To be continued.

613
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,042
Mein liebchen,
I'm so glad I found you.

614
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:38,378
Come on. This party's
getting rough.

615
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,422
Hyah!

616
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:21,254
Am I good? I'm good.

617
00:47:21,464 --> 00:47:24,299
Bar the doors!
Don't let them get away.
Surround the great hall.

618
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:26,301
Now you're talkin'.

619
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,345
Shut the door.

620
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,287
I hope it's worth
the noise!

621
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:15,016
We've got him.
We've got him.

622
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,397
Aha! Right rope.

623
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:45,005
Oh!

624
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,007
Look at this.

625
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:50,677
We went from royalty
to recycling.

626
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,972
Little John,
would you get the door?
Yeah, I'll try.

627
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,559
Well, it's been
a wonderful party,

628
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:59,894
and we'd love to stay
and all that, but, um,

629
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,731
I'm afraid we really
must dash, so ta-ta.

630
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:16,286
No, no, no.

631
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,588
I sent word
throughout England
that each village...

632
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,049
should send
the very best men
they have.

633
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,384
These are them.

634
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:38,808
Hmm, we're in
a lot of trouble.

635
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:44,230
Good people who have traveled
from villages near and far,

636
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:46,232
lend me your ears.

637
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,240
That's disgusting.

638
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,493
Hear me!

639
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:59,746
Men the likes of Prince John
and Rottingham must be stopped.

640
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,333
Stopped from taxing us into
poverty, from taking from us
what is rightfully ours.

641
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,129
If we stand up to them,
all together as one,

642
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,465
we can win the day!

643
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:14,302
We shall go on to the end.
We shall not flag or fail.

644
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:16,805
We shall fight
on the seas and oceans.

645
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:20,433
We shall defend our isle,
whatever the cost may be.

646
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,478
We shall never surrender.

647
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,438
Then they shall
say of us,

648
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,774
"Never have so many...

649
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:30,527
owed so much to so few."

650
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:36,241
That was beautiful.
What's going on?

651
00:50:36,325 --> 00:50:38,201
They're asleep.

652
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,747
Hey, man.

653
00:50:42,832 --> 00:50:44,958
Tough room.

654
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:49,587
Why don't you let me
give it a try?
Okay.

655
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:01,766
- Look at yourselves!
-

656
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:05,520
Go ahead.
Take a look around.

657
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:09,190
- Oh, people of Sherwood,
you been had!
-  Yeah!

658
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,192
Hoodwinked!
Yeah!

659
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,236
Bamboozled!
Yeah!

660
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,238
Run amok.

661
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,490
We didn't land
on Sherwood Forest.

662
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,243
Sherwood Forest
landed on us!

663
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,953
Yeah!

664
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,955
Very good.

665
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:26,708
They're all warmed up.

666
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:31,004
Brother Ahchoo is right.
And I say we fight back!

667
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:33,256
Yeah!
Yes.

668
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:38,011
- Are you with me,
yea or nay?
- Which one means yes?

669
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:43,016
- Yea.
-  Yea!

670
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,728
Men, grab your uniforms
and equipment...

671
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,938
and prepare for
the training sequence.

672
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:53,401
All right, gentlemen,
grab your feathered caps,
jerkins, bodkins,

673
00:51:53,486 --> 00:51:56,780
boots, swords,
quivers...

674
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,282
and panty hose.

675
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:05,371
Now, men, the object
of this exercise...

676
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,082
is to hit the target.

677
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:16,174
All right?

678
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,309
Oh!

679
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:33,024
Hmm!

680
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,777
Oh!

681
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:48,081
Now, men, I want you
to keep your eye on Will...

682
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:50,083
and do exactly
as he does.

683
00:52:51,502 --> 00:52:53,419
Ah-ooh!

684
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,553
Yeah!
Very good.
Well done, Will.

685
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,805
Right!
All right, Will!

686
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:08,184
That's not so hard.
We could do that.
Piece of cake.

687
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,148
Good boy.
Ready, men?

688
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:17,694
Charge!

689
00:53:25,578 --> 00:53:28,830
Oh, man.

690
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,041
Hey, Rob, man,
maybe we should take
the dummies into battle.

691
00:53:32,126 --> 00:53:34,043
Ha!

692
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,965
Hmm.

693
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:47,098
Sire?
I must speak with you.

694
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,269
What are you smelling?

695
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:55,565
These aren't my bubbles.
They're from the pipes.

696
00:53:55,691 --> 00:53:58,776
Your Majesty,
I have terrible news.
What?

697
00:53:58,861 --> 00:54:01,446
"Strucky"
has "loxed" again.

698
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:05,992
What?
Loxley has struck again.

699
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:09,412
I'm gonna need privacy,
so you guys can blow.

700
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,958
Not blow. Blow!

701
00:54:20,341 --> 00:54:22,634
I'm so depressed.

702
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:27,013
Your Majesty, come with me,
and I will show you something
that will make you very happy.

703
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:31,100
Fetch the royal robe!
Your Majesty?

704
00:54:31,185 --> 00:54:33,895
Stop me if I'm wrong
about this, but...

705
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:38,066
wasn't your mole...
on the other side?

706
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,362
I have a mole?

707
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:44,364
What is it?

708
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:47,867
It's what we've named
a stealth catapult.

709
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:51,371
We've been working on it
secretly for months.

710
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:55,667
It can hurl one
of these heavy boulders,
undetected,

711
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,629
over a hundred yards,
completely destroying
anything it hits.

712
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:02,548
Wow!
How does it work?
It's quite simple.

713
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:05,718
You just take one of these
heavy rocks, put it here
where I'm sitting,

714
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:07,679
and then pull
on that lever.

715
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,931
You mean, like this?

716
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,228
Oh, Dear Lord,

717
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:19,315
if you see fit to send me
my one true love—

718
00:55:22,403 --> 00:55:24,529
Thank you!

719
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:29,325
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

720
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,537
Oh, my God!
Here! Let me work
my magic on you!

721
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,581
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

722
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,292
No, no!
I've got a headache.
I've got a headache.

723
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:41,587
Where are you going?
Oh, bugger!

724
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:45,675
I was that close.

725
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:49,637
I touched it.

726
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:59,105
I don't like the way
you're walking.

727
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,108
You've been into
the sacramental wine again.

728
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:04,193
You're farshnoshket!

729
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,779
You drunken mule, you.

730
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:13,911
Whoa, Morris, whoa.

731
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,913
Halt there, friend.

732
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:19,000
You’ve just entered
the territory of Robin Hood
and his Merry Men.

733
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:27,383
- Faigelehs?
-  No!

734
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:30,678
No, no, no, no.
We're straight,
just merry.

735
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:33,264
Azoy?
And who might you be,

736
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,850
with the exceptionally long
feather in your hat?

737
00:56:35,976 --> 00:56:39,270
I am Robin of Loxley.
Robin of Loxley?

738
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:41,647
I've just come
from Maid Marian,

739
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:46,152
the lady whose heart you stole,
you prince of thieves, you.

740
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:52,325
I knew her mother and father
before they were taken
in the plague.

741
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:54,577
Lord and Lady Bagelle.

742
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:57,330
You were meant
for each other,
you and Maid Marian.

743
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:01,751
What a combination!
Loxley and Bagelle.
You can't miss.

744
00:57:02,878 --> 00:57:04,754
And who are you, sir?

745
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:07,006
I am Rabbi Tuckman,

746
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:09,509
purveyor
of sacramental wine...

747
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:12,053
and mohel extraordinaire.

748
00:57:12,137 --> 00:57:16,307
- Hello, Rabbi.
- Hello, boys.

749
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:19,185
Mohel. Don't believe
I've ever heard
of that profession.

750
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:23,940
Mohel?
He's a very important guy.
He makes circumcisions.

751
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:27,401
What, pray tell, sir,
is a circumcision?

752
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:31,489
Oh, it's the latest rage.
The ladies love it.
I want one!

753
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,991
I'll take two.
Put me down too.
I'm getting one.

754
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:37,370
I'm game.
How's it done?
It's a snap.

755
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:40,039
I take my little machine.

756
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,043
I take your
little thing, see?

757
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:46,546
I put it into
this little hole here,

758
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,173
and... nip the tip!

759
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:51,008
Ow!

760
00:57:51,093 --> 00:57:54,804
- Who's first?
- I changed me mind.

761
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:58,057
I forgot, man.
I already got one.
Christian.

762
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,560
I gotta work with
a much younger crowd.

763
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,855
Rabbi, you seem to be
on the side of good.

764
00:58:03,939 --> 00:58:06,858
Will you join us
and share with us
some of your wisdom,

765
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:10,528
some of your counsel,
and, uh, perhaps...
some of your wine?

766
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:14,907
Wisdom and counsel,
that's easy.

767
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:19,871
But this is sacramental wine.
It's only used to bless things.

768
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,793
Wait a minute!

769
00:58:25,878 --> 00:58:28,421
There's things here-
there's trees,
there's rocks,

770
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,715
there's birds,
there's squirrels.

771
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:34,218
Come on!
We'll bless them all
until we get farshnoshket!

772
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:37,096
-Join me!
-

773
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,724
Let's hear it
for the rabbi!

774
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,863
Good evening,
Don Giovanni.
Yeah.

775
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:58,367
Buona sera.
Buona sera.

776
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:01,162
Yes. It was, uh,
very good of you to come
at such short notice.

777
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:04,582
Well.
And all the way
from Jersey.

778
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,168
Well, it is
quite a drive.

779
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:12,506
Yes, but you do realize that
Prince John expressly commanded
this to be a secret meeting?

780
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:15,259
I mean,
who are these men?

781
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:17,803
These are
my trusted associates.

782
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:20,223
On my right,
Dirty Ezio.

783
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:27,313
On my left,
Filthy Luca.

784
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:31,692
Now.
We thank you
for inviting us...

785
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:35,613
on the day
of your daughter's wedding.
No, no.

786
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:39,242
I hope her first child
is a masculine child.

787
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:41,911
Shut up. We didn't
even have our meeting yet.

788
00:59:42,037 --> 00:59:44,538
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

789
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,043
All right.

790
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:52,630
I understand that you have
been bothered by this fruit,
Robin Hood.

791
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,716
That you want Robin
rubbed out,

792
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:58,594
eliminated,
maybe even killed.

793
00:59:58,679 --> 01:00:01,389
Yes.
You put it succinctly.

794
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:05,434
Suck what?
Succinctly.
It means perfectly.

795
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:07,436
Oh, yeah.
Well, I knew that.

796
01:00:10,524 --> 01:00:13,276
Excuse me, Don Giovanni.

797
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,778
Your lizard seems limp.

798
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,907
At my age, you know,
sometimes-

799
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:22,285
Oh, oh, my lizard.
Oh! No.

800
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,787
Nah, he’s just sleeping.
Charlie.

801
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,956
Charlie. Oh, Charlie.

802
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:31,711
Charlie, I could've been
somebody. I could have been
a contender.

803
01:00:31,795 --> 01:00:34,588
You know, Charlie's—
Charlie's got bad breath.

804
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:39,969
Oh! He got excited,
you know.

805
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:42,471
Come over here, Ezio.

806
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:46,100
Uh— Mmm, no.

807
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:50,021
Now, normally
I would be so happy
to be of service to you,

808
01:00:50,105 --> 01:00:53,607
but there is something
that weighs very heavily
on my heart.

809
01:00:53,692 --> 01:00:57,445
In the years
that we have been friends,
England and Jersey,

810
01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:01,615
never once have you
invited me to your home
for coffee and cake...

811
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:05,286
or ganool, something,
you know.
A "guh-what"?

812
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,913
A ganool.
It's a pastry
with stuffing.

813
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,374
And it's got sprinkles
on it. Mmm.

814
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:14,128
Excuse me.
I don't understand
a word you're saying.

815
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:18,382
I just came back
from the dentist,

816
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:22,720
and they left in
the cotton balls.

817
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:26,265
I will take these cotton balls
from you with my hand...

818
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,769
and put them in my pocket.

819
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:35,191
Yeah. Whatever.

820
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:37,443
You know, your other associate
says very little.

821
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:39,779
Well, my other associate
says nothing.
Why is that?

822
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:43,199
Because my enemy
cut out his tongue.

823
01:01:43,283 --> 01:01:45,743
Good grief!
Why?

824
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:49,497
Well, 'cause he went
like this.

825
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:52,875
And he didn't like it,
so he cut out his tongue.

826
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:55,002
Come over here.
Go like this.

827
01:01:57,089 --> 01:02:00,299
He can't do it.

828
01:02:00,384 --> 01:02:04,261
I love to tease him!

829
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:07,765
Tell me, Don Giovanni.
Yeah, that's me.
What?

830
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,767
What do you intend to do
about Robin Hood?

831
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:11,769
Listen to this.
I got an idea.

832
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:15,773
Tomorrow— Tomorrow you're
gonna have your medieval
fun and games.

833
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,901
You'll make
the most important event
the archery contest.

834
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:22,530
Robin will not be able
to resist.
Why is that?

835
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:25,491
We'll make him an offer
he can't refuse.

836
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:28,786
I was just gonna say that.

837
01:02:28,912 --> 01:02:30,788
That's brilliant!
Thank you.

838
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,832
But-
What?

839
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:36,043
You do realize that Robin
is the finest archer
in the land?

840
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:38,295
Oh, no.
Don't you understand?

841
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,173
Luca is good,
better, best.

842
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,093
Show him
your archery medals.

843
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,095
Ta-da!

844
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:48,514
Wowee!

845
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:51,267
See? I couldn't
have said it better myself.

846
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:55,104
Now, Luca beats Robin
at the archery contest,

847
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:59,942
and then Dirty Ezio
makes Robin no more.

848
01:03:02,362 --> 01:03:05,948
No more?
All right, you want
plain English?

849
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:08,576
Robin is gonna be dead.

850
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:12,288
D-E-D. Dead.

851
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:23,048
You hear him?

852
01:03:40,525 --> 01:03:42,902
Broomhilde?
Broomhilde, wake up!

853
01:03:42,986 --> 01:03:44,862
There's a foul plot afoot.

854
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:48,199
It's not mine feet.
I just washed them.
No, no, no.

855
01:03:48,283 --> 01:03:51,118
Prince John and the sheriff
have hired men to kill Robin.

856
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,287
We must warn him
immediately!

857
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:56,248
Wait, mein lady!
If Prince John should see us-

858
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:59,418
You're right.
We'll go out the back.
Right.

859
01:04:01,922 --> 01:04:03,881
Lady!

860
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:15,267
Broomhilde,
I'm going on ahead.

861
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:18,062
Catch me up.
Come on, Lady.

862
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:21,899
Farfelkugel!

863
01:04:44,673 --> 01:04:46,632
Ooh.

864
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:54,848
Farfelkugel.
If I was you,

865
01:04:54,933 --> 01:04:57,518
I would never
do that again.

866
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:01,564
Any questions?

867
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:04,233
Good.

868
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:10,030
Forward!

869
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:28,215
Blinkin, what are you
doing up there?

870
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:32,803
Guessing.
I...

871
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,931
guess no one's coming.

872
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:42,605
Please come down from there.
Twit.

873
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:48,319
Well, I guess there's a ladder
around here somewhere.

874
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:51,697
Oh. Here we are.
Right.

875
01:06:02,417 --> 01:06:04,460
Oh, shit.

876
01:06:18,767 --> 01:06:20,726
I can see!

877
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,736
No, I was wrong.

878
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:44,917
Blimey, these are
hard to get on.

879
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,837
Let's face it.
You gotta be a man
to wear tights.

880
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,009
Will, how are me seams?

881
01:06:54,135 --> 01:06:57,846
Perfect.
Every time.

882
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:03,936
We're men
We're men in tights

883
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:07,189
We roam around the forest
looking for fights

884
01:07:07,273 --> 01:07:11,485
We're men
We're men in tights

885
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,863
We rob from the rich
and give to the poor
That's right!

886
01:07:14,948 --> 01:07:18,909
We may look like sissies

887
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:22,871
But watch what you say
or else we'll put out
your lights

888
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:26,792
We're men
We're men in tights

889
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,379
Always on guard defending
the people's rights

890
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:34,800
La, la, la, la, la, la
la, la, la

891
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:39,054
La, la, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la

892
01:07:39,139 --> 01:07:42,266
La, la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la
la, la, la, la

893
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:44,226
We're men
Manly men!

894
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:46,437
We're men in tights
Yes!

895
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:49,898
We roam around the forest
looking for fights

896
01:07:49,983 --> 01:07:54,236
We're men
We're men in tights

897
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:57,573
We rob from the rich
and give to the poor
That's right!

898
01:07:57,657 --> 01:08:01,869
We may look like pansies

899
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:05,205
But don't get us wrong
or else we'll put out
your lights

900
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:09,418
We're men
we're men in tights
Tight tights!

901
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:13,255
Always on guard defending
the people's rights

902
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,425
When you're in a fix
just call for the men
in tights

903
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:18,802
We're butch!

904
01:08:33,026 --> 01:08:34,943
Marian!

905
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,910
Here.
Allow me.

906
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:44,912
Oh, thank you.

907
01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:56,965
You are so sweet.

908
01:08:57,050 --> 01:09:00,385
Is there anything
I can do for you?

909
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,888
Yeah.
You can get off me.

910
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:08,185
-
- Little John!

911
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,187
I panicked.

912
01:09:16,236 --> 01:09:18,862
Darling, what are you
doing here?
I have come to warn you.

913
01:09:18,947 --> 01:09:22,282
Prince John and Rottingham
have hired murderers to kill
you at the fair tomorrow!

914
01:09:22,367 --> 01:09:24,993
You mustn't go!

915
01:09:25,078 --> 01:09:28,288
That's easy.
I won't.

916
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:30,833
Oh, I'm so happy.

917
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:35,170
They were going to try
to lure you there by having
an archery contest.

918
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:38,215
An archery contest?

919
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:40,384
Their archer
is unbeatable.

920
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:44,888
Really?
Robin, promise
you won't go.

921
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:49,101
All right.
I promise you won't go.
Thank you.

922
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:52,896
- Hey, wait a minute, Robin.
You said that—
- Cool it.

923
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:56,191
Chill.

924
01:09:56,276 --> 01:09:58,235
Come, my dear.

925
01:10:07,078 --> 01:10:10,247
The night is young,
and you're so beautiful.

926
01:10:10,331 --> 01:10:12,666
B-flat.

927
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:15,752
The night is young
Haah!

928
01:10:15,837 --> 01:10:18,630
And you're so beautiful

929
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:22,593
Here among the shadows

930
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:27,764
Beautiful lady

931
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:33,395
Open your heart

932
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:36,231
The scene is set

933
01:10:36,316 --> 01:10:38,984
The breezes sing of it

934
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:43,822
Can't you get
into the swing of it

935
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:47,326
Lady

936
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:51,246
When do we start

937
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:54,917
- When the lady
is kissable
- Ooh

938
01:10:55,043 --> 01:11:00,964
And the evening is cool
Ooh

939
01:11:01,049 --> 01:11:04,885
Any dream is permissible

940
01:11:04,969 --> 01:11:10,223
- In the heart of a fool
- Ooh

941
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:13,101
Oh.
The moon is high

942
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:17,064
And you're so glamorous

943
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:20,525
And if I seem
over-amorous

944
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23,987
- Lady
- Ooh

945
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:28,784
What can I do

946
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:33,664
The night is young

947
01:11:33,748 --> 01:11:36,458
And I'm in love

948
01:11:36,542 --> 01:11:40,504
- With
-

949
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:44,967
You

950
01:12:00,692 --> 01:12:03,485
Em, uh-

951
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:11,076
Oh, my dearest.
I'm ready for that kiss now.

952
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,037
But first
I must warn you.

953
01:12:14,122 --> 01:12:16,289
It could only be a kiss,

954
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:18,542
for I am a virgin...

955
01:12:18,626 --> 01:12:20,877
and could never...

956
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:23,130
go all the way.
But—

957
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:26,550
Unless, of course,
I were married.

958
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:31,054
Or if a man pledged
his endless love to me.

959
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:36,101
Yes-
Or if I knew that he
desperately cared for me,

960
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:39,062
or if he were really cute.

961
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,608
But, my darling,
you're shivering.

962
01:12:43,693 --> 01:12:47,237
Are you cold?
What are you wearing
underneath that cape?

963
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:50,115
Practically nothing.

964
01:12:50,241 --> 01:12:53,785
Ohh!

965
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,038
Oh, except that.

966
01:12:56,122 --> 01:12:58,457
I forgot to tell you
about my chastity belt.

967
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:01,668
It's an Everlast.
I'll bet.

968
01:13:01,753 --> 01:13:04,671
Oh, darling.
Don't despair.

969
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:07,215
For it was written
on a scroll,

970
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,177
"One day he
who is destined for me...

971
01:13:10,261 --> 01:13:12,888
"shall be endowed
with the magical key...

972
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:16,767
that will bring
an end to my virginity."

973
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,686
Oh, Marian!

974
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:23,732
If only 'twere me.
Oh, if it 'twere you,
'twould be...

975
01:13:23,816 --> 01:13:26,985
"twerrific."

976
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:31,114
Achtung! No ding-ding
without the wedding ring.

977
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:39,998
A-bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

978
01:13:50,009 --> 01:13:52,302
Good-bye, my dearest.

979
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:02,104
- A-bup, bup, bup.
- Toodle-oo.

980
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:06,817
Au revoir,
auf Wiedersehen, ciao.

981
01:14:22,959 --> 01:14:26,628
Time out, time out.
What is wrong?

982
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,965
I should have never
worn these shoes!

983
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:32,300
They just don't
match my purse.

984
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:35,762
Blinkin,
fix your boobs.
What?

985
01:14:35,847 --> 01:14:38,849
You look like
a bleeding Picasso.

986
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,185
Oh!
Goodness gracious.

987
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:47,607
Peanuts!
Peanut power here.

988
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:50,944
Hey, poor man's lunch there.
Hey, you. Shell game here.

989
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:04,958
The royal archery contest
is about to begin!

990
01:15:06,169 --> 01:15:08,837
Archers,
take your places.

991
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:20,765
Are we... prepared?

992
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,851
Sire.
Hmm?

993
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:44,122
Oh, that's good.

994
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:46,124
That's good.

995
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:49,920
Archers to the line!

996
01:15:57,929 --> 01:16:00,680
Ready.

997
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:02,682
Aim.

998
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:06,436
Wait for it.

999
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:10,565
Fire!

1000
01:16:15,363 --> 01:16:18,573
The two archers that hit
the bull's-eye can stay.

1001
01:16:18,658 --> 01:16:22,535
The rest of you gentlemen
can bugger off.

1002
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:24,663
Granddad
won't like this.

1003
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:29,834
There he is.

1004
01:16:29,919 --> 01:16:32,337
The old man
is Loxley.

1005
01:16:35,675 --> 01:16:37,926
Are you sure?

1006
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:40,053
It looks like Mark Twain.

1007
01:16:42,390 --> 01:16:46,017
The old man
may go first.

1008
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:00,532
Well done,
Robin of Loxley.

1009
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:21,428
He's crazy.
We gotta stop him.

1010
01:17:23,556 --> 01:17:26,391
Sorry, ladies.
This is the royal entrance.

1011
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:28,518
You'll have to go around
the other way.

1012
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:33,982
Look what you've done.
You idiot!

1013
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:36,484
Now he's even more of a hero
to the people.

1014
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:38,862
Luca Pazzo
still has a shot.

1015
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:43,575
But he hit the very center
of the bull's-eye, schmuck!

1016
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:48,538
Wait and watch, sire.

1017
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:04,179
He split Robin's arrow
in twain!

1018
01:18:05,765 --> 01:18:09,017
Things are looking up, huh?

1019
01:18:14,148 --> 01:18:16,107
Nice shot!

1020
01:18:23,157 --> 01:18:27,911
Oh, Robin's in trouble.
Come on!
Hey!

1021
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:31,915
I lost. I lost?

1022
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:34,042
Wait a minute.
I'm not supposed to lose.

1023
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,044
Let me see the script.

1024
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,632
Yo, Robin,
time to fly.

1025
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:43,343
Go back to Sherwood Forest!

1026
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:46,679
Oh, good.
They've opened
the salad bar.

1027
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:49,641
Wait!
I get another shot!

1028
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:52,394
He gets another shot!

1029
01:18:52,478 --> 01:18:55,105
Does Robin get
another shot?

1030
01:19:02,154 --> 01:19:04,989
Yes, he does. He does.

1031
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:12,747
Squires and ladies,
silence. Listen.
Robin has another shot.

1032
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:17,794
Let's give him
the chop!

1033
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:22,465
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

1034
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:26,678
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

1035
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:30,098
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

1036
01:19:30,182 --> 01:19:34,144
Oh-oh-oh
Quick. Eliminate him
before he shoots.

1037
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:38,982
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

1038
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,234
Oh-oh-oh

1039
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,074
How did you do that?

1040
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:50,618
I heard that coming
a mile away.

1041
01:19:50,744 --> 01:19:54,289
Very good, Blinkin.
Well done.
Pardon? Who's talking?

1042
01:19:55,374 --> 01:19:57,292
"Patriot arrow"?

1043
01:20:36,665 --> 01:20:38,583
Yes!

1044
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,883
Arrest him!

1045
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,302
Move it, move it!

1046
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:51,971
Out of the way!

1047
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,973
Loxley is a traitor
to the crown!

1048
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:56,976
It'll be so much fun
to watch you hang.

1049
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,357
Wait.

1050
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:04,400
What for?

1051
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:08,238
If you promise not to kill
Robin, I shall do the most
disgusting thing...

1052
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:11,282
that I can think of.
Mmm.

1053
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:14,202
And what's that?

1054
01:21:15,663 --> 01:21:18,540
I shall marry you.
What?

1055
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:22,627
You'll be mine?
You'll give yourself
to me every night?

1056
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:26,005
And sometimes
right after lunch?

1057
01:21:26,090 --> 01:21:29,551
Yes. But only my body.

1058
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:34,806
You can never have my heart,
my mind or my soul.

1059
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,725
Oh. Oh, yes.
I respect that. Mm-hmm.

1060
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:44,524
Marian, my life's
not worth it!
Just say nay!

1061
01:21:46,694 --> 01:21:49,779
Ha!
Walk this way.

1062
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:04,752
-
- Send word to one and all
and all and one!

1063
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:08,631
- That's a little redundant, isn't it?
- What?

1064
01:22:08,716 --> 01:22:12,468
Shut up! Tell everybody
that before the day is out,

1065
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:15,638
we shall have a wedding...
or a hanging.

1066
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:18,099
Either way we ought to have
a lot of fun, huh?

1067
01:22:25,024 --> 01:22:27,275
Man, we are
grossly outnumbered.

1068
01:22:27,359 --> 01:22:29,569
Yeah, so what
can we do?

1069
01:22:29,695 --> 01:22:33,114
We gotta get the villagers.
The villagers?
They're not ready to fight.

1070
01:22:33,198 --> 01:22:35,283
Man,
we are choiceless.

1071
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:38,244
Blinkin, what's the fastest
way to reach the villagers?

1072
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,455
Why don't we fox them!
Fox 'em.

1073
01:22:40,581 --> 01:22:43,249
Fox 'em.
Fox 'em.

1074
01:22:55,054 --> 01:22:58,806
Now, Mickey, take
this message to the village
as fast as you can.

1075
01:22:58,891 --> 01:23:00,767
Pay attention.
Have you got it?

1076
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:02,977
Good.

1077
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:14,405
Come on, y'all.
Let's get out this ladies'
clothing and into our tights.

1078
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:21,412
Come on, man.
There you go.

1079
01:23:21,622 --> 01:23:26,668
Let's see. Are you about
a 16, 16 1/2, huh?

1080
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:32,173
Ooh, ooh.

1081
01:23:38,222 --> 01:23:40,181
There.
It's a little tight.

1082
01:23:40,265 --> 01:23:43,518
Well, that's the idea.

1083
01:23:44,603 --> 01:23:47,230
Would you care
for a blindfold?

1084
01:23:47,314 --> 01:23:49,482
No. How about half a one?

1085
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:52,026
A kiss, sir?

1086
01:24:04,415 --> 01:24:06,332
Sorry.

1087
01:24:08,711 --> 01:24:10,336
Good Morrow, Abbot.
Good Morrow.

1088
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:12,255
Welcome, Abbot.
Good Morrow.

1089
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,006
Hello, Abbot.
Good Morrow.

1090
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:18,511
Hey, Abbot!
I hate that guy.

1091
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:30,064
Ooh, she's beautiful.
Goodness!

1092
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:34,569
Present swords!

1093
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:03,806
What's going on?

1094
01:25:03,891 --> 01:25:07,477
Just in case
you change your mind,
my dear.

1095
01:25:07,561 --> 01:25:11,189
I will conduct
the opening prayer
in the New Latin.

1096
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:15,276
O Ord-lay,

1097
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,071
iveus-gay our-yay
essings-blay.

1098
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:24,160
Amen-ay

1099
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:27,872
Amen-ay

1100
01:25:30,459 --> 01:25:32,960
We are gathered here
today...

1101
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:37,089
to witness the marriage
of Mervyn, the sheriff of-

1102
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:45,181
Mervyn?
Your name is Mervyn?

1103
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:50,770
Shut up, shut up!

1104
01:25:50,896 --> 01:25:52,939
Continue with
the service!

1105
01:25:54,483 --> 01:25:56,943
Okay, Mervyn.

1106
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:11,874
Do you,
Sheriff of Rottingham,

1107
01:26:11,959 --> 01:26:15,253
take Maid Marian of Bagelle
to be your lawful wedded wife,

1108
01:26:15,337 --> 01:26:18,047
to love and to hold
in sickness and in health...

1109
01:26:18,173 --> 01:26:21,801
till death do you part?
Yes! I do!
Get on with it!

1110
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:25,680
Do you, Marian, vow to do
all the stuff I just said
to him?

1111
01:26:27,015 --> 01:26:30,268
Say "I do," or Robin dies.

1112
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:38,150
I— I-

1113
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:41,112
I— I—

1114
01:26:41,196 --> 01:26:43,614
I do... not!

1115
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:46,909
-
- Oh!

1116
01:26:49,413 --> 01:26:51,998
Who's the man?
Who's the man?
Go!

1117
01:26:52,082 --> 01:26:54,417
Arrest them!
Seize them!
Stop them!

1118
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:56,627
Hurt them!
Hurt them!

1119
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:59,922
Look! The villagers
are coming!

1120
01:27:09,141 --> 01:27:11,225
Oh!
I believe this
belongs to you, sir.

1121
01:27:11,310 --> 01:27:13,728
Well, you know
what they say.

1122
01:27:13,812 --> 01:27:15,897
No noose is good noose.

1123
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:26,741
Nice shooting,
Ahchoo.

1124
01:27:26,825 --> 01:27:29,660
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was aiming for the hangman.

1125
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:35,875
Uh-oh, fellas.
We got company.

1126
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:39,420
On the count of jump.
Wait for it.

1127
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,380
Charge!

1128
01:27:41,465 --> 01:27:43,925
Jump.

1129
01:27:51,475 --> 01:27:53,392
Oh, yeah!

1130
01:27:54,853 --> 01:27:56,812
Ow.

1131
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:07,782
I shall have you,
married or no.

1132
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,805
Yeah!

1133
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:39,355
The sheriff.
He got your woman, man.

1134
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,608
He's takin' her
to the tower.

1135
01:28:42,693 --> 01:28:46,821
He gonna deflower her
in the tower. Ooh.

1136
01:28:46,905 --> 01:28:51,742
I'm sorry we don't have
enough time for romance,
my dear.

1137
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:57,707
Consider this foreplay.

1138
01:29:01,837 --> 01:29:03,879
A chastity belt!

1139
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:07,717
Ooh, that's going to chafe
my willy.

1140
01:29:07,843 --> 01:29:09,635
I'll be back.
Wha-

1141
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:13,097
I hope she's still wearin'
her iron underwear.
Yeah.

1142
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:17,518
No matter what you do,

1143
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:21,188
I shall never
submi-i-i-it!

1144
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:29,822
- Aha!
- Robi-i-i-in!

1145
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:35,786
- Prepare for the fight scene.
-

1146
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:39,957
Forgive the interruption,
my darling.

1147
01:29:40,042 --> 01:29:44,336
I'll dispatch your love
and then come back...

1148
01:29:44,421 --> 01:29:46,922
and finish the job.

1149
01:29:50,302 --> 01:29:52,970
En garde.
Thanks for the warning.

1150
01:29:57,642 --> 01:29:59,769
- Shocking!
-

1151
01:30:06,193 --> 01:30:09,361
Parry, parry,
thrust, thrust.

1152
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:11,363
Good!

1153
01:30:11,448 --> 01:30:13,949
-
-

1154
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:40,476
-
-

1155
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:53,239
Hey!
Oh, sorry.

1156
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:38,325
It is the key
to the greatest treasure
in all the land!

1157
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:42,163
Oh! Robin, this means
you've always been
my one true love,

1158
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:44,415
because it’s just
the right size.

1159
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:48,502
It's not the size that counts!
It's how you use it!

1160
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:51,088
Robin!

1161
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:53,507
Aha! Ha, ha!

1162
01:31:55,886 --> 01:31:58,179
Ha, ha.

1163
01:32:00,599 --> 01:32:04,059
- Thank you, my friend.
-

1164
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:07,980
- Aah.
-

1165
01:32:18,033 --> 01:32:20,451
Oh, it's not so bad.

1166
01:32:23,622 --> 01:32:25,581
I was wrong.

1167
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:34,673
Oh, my dear beloved
sheriff of Rottingham!

1168
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:36,675
You've been run through.

1169
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,553
How do you feel?

1170
01:32:39,638 --> 01:32:42,973
I'm dying, you fool!

1171
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:45,017
You don't have to die.
I don't?

1172
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:49,396
No. I've got
this magic pill...

1173
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:51,857
that could save
your life.

1174
01:32:53,443 --> 01:32:58,072
And I'll give it to you
if you promise to marry me...

1175
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:00,658
and be mine forever.

1176
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:07,831
Oh, all right.
Yes, yes.

1177
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:18,926
How do you feel now?
Good, good.

1178
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:22,846
Surprisingly good.
And yet, somehow...

1179
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:26,350
incredibly depressed.

1180
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:41,448
I always wanted
to marry a cop.

1181
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:46,287
Wait, wait!
I've changed my mind!

1182
01:33:50,417 --> 01:33:53,127
I love you,
Robin of Loxley.

1183
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:55,671
And I you,
Marian of Bagelle.

1184
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:57,715
Oh!

1185
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,770
Oh, my darling.

1186
01:34:11,896 --> 01:34:16,442
At last.
Yes, yes.

1187
01:34:16,526 --> 01:34:20,696
Yes, yes!
Yes!

1188
01:34:22,741 --> 01:34:25,159
No!

1189
01:34:29,289 --> 01:34:32,082
Wait, wait!
You're not married yet!

1190
01:34:32,167 --> 01:34:35,961
Before you do it,
you must go through it.

1191
01:34:36,046 --> 01:34:40,049
Or else I blew it.

1192
01:34:47,057 --> 01:34:49,141
Hey, Rabbi!

1193
01:34:53,772 --> 01:34:55,689
Who calls?

1194
01:34:55,774 --> 01:35:00,444
It is I, Robin.
We wish to get married
in a hurry!

1195
01:35:00,528 --> 01:35:03,238
Married in a hurry!
That's wonderful. Wait!

1196
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:06,033
I'm on my last customer.
I'll be right out.

1197
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:13,499
Put a little ice on it.
It'll be fine.
Ay, yi, yi!

1198
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:19,213
Married in a hurry,
married in a hurry!
Please invite me to the bris.

1199
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:21,173
Now, are you ready?

1200
01:35:21,299 --> 01:35:23,342
Robin, do you?
I do.

1201
01:35:23,468 --> 01:35:25,844
Marian, do you?
I do.

1202
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:29,807
I now pronounce you
man and-
I object.

1203
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:32,101
Who asked?

1204
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:35,854
It's King Richard,
back from the Crusades!

1205
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:39,775
Boy, now I'm in trouble.

1206
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:46,407
You are no longer worthy
to wear...

1207
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:49,159
this sacred symbol
of authority!

1208
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:53,872
Oh, please have mercy
on me, Brother.

1209
01:35:53,957 --> 01:35:57,459
It wasn't my fault.
I got some really bad
advice from Rottingham.

1210
01:35:57,544 --> 01:35:59,253
Bullshit! Bullshit!

1211
01:35:59,337 --> 01:36:03,757
Brother,
you have surrounded
your given name...

1212
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:07,010
with a foul stench.

1213
01:36:07,095 --> 01:36:09,012
From this day forth,

1214
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:11,181
all the toilets
in this kingdom...

1215
01:36:11,266 --> 01:36:15,227
shall be known
as "johns."

1216
01:36:15,353 --> 01:36:18,439
No!

1217
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:20,858
Take him away!
No. Wait, wait.

1218
01:36:20,942 --> 01:36:24,486
Put him
in the Tower of London.

1219
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:28,782
Make him part of the tour.

1220
01:36:32,829 --> 01:36:36,081
Robin, the news
of your great deeds...

1221
01:36:36,166 --> 01:36:38,459
has reached me
even in Jerusalem.

1222
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:41,795
England owes you and your men
a great debt of gratitude.

1223
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:46,258
Henceforth, all your
family's rights and lands
shall be returned,

1224
01:36:46,342 --> 01:36:49,470
and you shall rule all Sherwood
from this day forth.

1225
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:56,852
Kneel, Robin of Loxley.

1226
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:04,610
And arise,
Sir Robin of Loxley.

1227
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:12,618
Thank you, sir.
Excuse me, King.

1228
01:37:12,702 --> 01:37:17,331
Why, if you like this guy
so much, do you object
to his marrying Maid Marian?

1229
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:20,751
I have no objections,
but I have not yet
kissed the bride.

1230
01:37:20,835 --> 01:37:23,962
It is a custom
and my royal right.

1231
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:26,465
Hold this, Father.
Rabbi.

1232
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:28,550
Whatever.

1233
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:40,145
It's good to be the king.

1234
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:47,486
Now you may marry them.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Here's your knife.

1235
01:37:47,612 --> 01:37:49,530
Sword.
Whatever.

1236
01:37:51,032 --> 01:37:54,284
Okay, where did we leave off?
Oh, that's right.

1237
01:37:54,369 --> 01:37:58,413
- We're up to the best part.
Do you, Marian?
- I do.

1238
01:37:58,540 --> 01:38:00,874
Do you, Robin?
I do.

1239
01:38:00,959 --> 01:38:04,878
I now pronounce you
man and...

1240
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:08,966
wife.

1241
01:38:16,849 --> 01:38:20,018
We're going to have to
remodel the castle...

1242
01:38:20,103 --> 01:38:23,272
to make room
for all the babies.

1243
01:38:28,611 --> 01:38:30,529
For my first
order of business,

1244
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:33,949
I wish to appoint
a new sheriff of Rottingham.

1245
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:37,160
My friend, Ahchoo.

1246
01:38:37,245 --> 01:38:39,246
All right!

1247
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,832
A black sheriff?

1248
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:44,126
He's black?

1249
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:48,797
And why not?
It worked in Blazing Saddles.

1250
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:52,175
That's good.

1251
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:58,974
Good-bye! Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

1252
01:39:06,774 --> 01:39:08,984
So that's the story
and it worked out good

1253
01:39:09,068 --> 01:39:11,528
King Richard's on his throne
and Robin's back in the hood

1254
01:39:11,613 --> 01:39:13,864
So let's bid our friends
a fond adieu

1255
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,991
And hope we meet again
in Robin Hood II

1256
01:39:16,075 --> 01:39:18,577
I said hey
Hey

1257
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:21,079
I said hey
Hey

1258
01:39:21,205 --> 01:39:24,833
I said hey
Hey, nonny, nonny, nonny
Hey, nonny, nonny, nonny

1259
01:39:24,917 --> 01:39:27,878
Here we go

1260
01:39:29,631 --> 01:39:31,757
Rise,

1261
01:39:31,841 --> 01:39:35,385
Sir Robin of Loxley.

1262
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:39,640
Yeah. Buona sera.
Buona sera.

1263
01:39:41,309 --> 01:39:44,186
Hey, Abbot!

1264
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:47,022
I hate that guy.

1265
01:39:47,106 --> 01:39:51,109
Let's see now, what are you,
16, 16 1/2?

1266
01:39:56,366 --> 01:39:58,909
Faigelehs?

1267
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:06,166
Welcome home,
Mrs. Of Loxley.

1268
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:10,337
Mrs. Of Loxley.
Oh, I'm so happy.

1269
01:40:16,344 --> 01:40:18,261
Oh, my dearest.

1270
01:40:18,346 --> 01:40:20,889
Shall I...
turn the key?

1271
01:40:20,973 --> 01:40:23,975
Oh, yes, darling!
But please...

1272
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,146
be gentle.

1273
01:40:33,861 --> 01:40:36,029
Um, darling.

1274
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:38,657
What?
You're not going to
believe this.

1275
01:40:38,783 --> 01:40:41,660
What?
It won't open.

1276
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:43,829
What?

1277
01:40:43,913 --> 01:40:46,498
Wait. I have an idea.

1278
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:48,417
Call the locksmith!

1279
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:50,877
Call the locksmith!

1280
01:40:50,962 --> 01:40:52,921
Call the locksmith!

1281
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:55,424
Call the locksmith!

1282
01:40:55,508 --> 01:40:58,593
Where is the one

1283
01:40:58,678 --> 01:41:03,014
That I love most of all

1284
01:41:03,099 --> 01:41:06,768
When will I
hear him call

1285
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:10,772
Marian, Marian

1286
01:41:10,857 --> 01:41:13,900
He is the one

1287
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:18,321
Who can make my life full

1288
01:41:18,406 --> 01:41:20,365
Joyful

1289
01:41:20,450 --> 01:41:24,411
Forevermore

1290
01:41:24,537 --> 01:41:29,040
Hey
Ooh

1291
01:41:30,209 --> 01:41:33,336
Where is the maid

1292
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:37,758
That I'm longing to see

1293
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:40,761
Where can she be

1294
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:45,557
My sweet Marian, Marian

1295
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:48,852
Oh, when will I

1296
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:53,231
Hold you here
in my arms

1297
01:41:53,316 --> 01:41:55,317
Knowing

1298
01:41:55,401 --> 01:41:58,862
You are my love

1299
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:02,991
I waited so patiently

1300
01:42:03,075 --> 01:42:06,745
For a true love

1301
01:42:06,829 --> 01:42:10,624
When will he come for me

1302
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:15,086
Where is he
Where is he

1303
01:42:15,171 --> 01:42:18,089
In all my dreams

1304
01:42:18,174 --> 01:42:22,636
There's a vision I see

1305
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,514
Your hand in mine

1306
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:30,477
My dear Marian, Marian

1307
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:33,897
There's no tomorrow

1308
01:42:33,981 --> 01:42:37,442
Without you, my love

1309
01:42:37,527 --> 01:42:41,530
Oh, you are my reason

1310
01:42:41,614 --> 01:42:44,950
To be

1311
01:42:50,790 --> 01:42:55,210
Oh

1312
01:43:01,425 --> 01:43:05,470
Hey
Hey

1313
01:43:11,477 --> 01:43:14,855
My heart has made a vow

1314
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:18,900
It’s just for you

1315
01:43:18,985 --> 01:43:22,487
You are my one true love

1316
01:43:22,572 --> 01:43:24,614
Only you

1317
01:43:24,699 --> 01:43:26,992
Only you

1318
01:43:27,076 --> 01:43:30,078
Where is the man

1319
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:34,624
Who carries the key

1320
01:43:34,709 --> 01:43:37,377
Please say it's me

1321
01:43:37,461 --> 01:43:42,507
My dear Marian, Marian

1322
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:45,719
I cannot wait

1323
01:43:45,803 --> 01:43:49,222
Till he sets my heart free

1324
01:43:49,307 --> 01:43:53,643
Oh, when will I know him

1325
01:43:53,728 --> 01:43:57,856
Oh, when will I see her

1326
01:43:57,940 --> 01:44:02,444
When will I hear him say

1327
01:44:02,528 --> 01:44:08,950
Marian, my love

00:12:32,762 --> 00:12:36,865
<i>Miss Kensington is her daughter.</i>

187
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:38,501
Ah, here she is.

188
00:12:41,271 --> 00:12:45,674
Vanessa is one of our top agents.

189
00:12:50,231 --> 00:12:53,666
My God, Vanessa's
got a fabulous body...

190
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:56,936
And I bet she shags like a minx.

191
00:12:57,921 --> 00:13:01,023
How do I tell them that because
of the unfreezing process,

192
00:13:01,091 --> 00:13:03,192
I have no inner monologue?

193
00:13:04,928 --> 00:13:08,898
I...Hope I didn't say
that out loud just now.

194
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:11,601
Heh heh heh...

195
00:13:13,103 --> 00:13:17,206
Mr. Powers, my job is to
acclimatize you to the nineties.

196
00:13:17,274 --> 00:13:19,509
You know, a lot's
changed since 1967.

197
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:22,778
No doubt, love, but as long
as people are still having

198
00:13:22,846 --> 00:13:26,315
promiscuous sex with many anonymous
partners without protection,

199
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:30,119
while at the same time experimenting
with mind-expanding drugs

200
00:13:30,187 --> 00:13:32,288
in a consequence-free environment,

201
00:13:32,356 --> 00:13:34,457
I'll be sound as a pound.

202
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:41,080
Danger Powers--
personal effects.

203
00:13:41,148 --> 00:13:44,183
Actually, my name is Austin Powers.

204
00:13:44,618 --> 00:13:46,252
It says here "name--
danger Powers."

205
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:48,821
No, no, no, no, no.

206
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:51,157
Danger's my middle name.

207
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:55,128
Ok. Austin
danger Powers--

208
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:58,297
one blue crushed velvet suit...

209
00:13:58,365 --> 00:13:59,298
Hey, all right.

210
00:13:59,366 --> 00:14:01,033
One frilly lace cravat...

211
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:02,101
There it is.

212
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:05,504
One silver medallion
with "male" symbol...

213
00:14:05,572 --> 00:14:08,340
One pair of Italian boots...

214
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:09,508
<i>Buon giorno, boys.</i>

215
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:11,177
One vinyl record album:

216
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:13,379
<i>Burt bacharach plays his hits...</i>

217
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:14,781
Hey, Burt!

218
00:14:14,848 --> 00:14:20,603
One Swedish-made...
Penis enlarger pump...

219
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:23,039
That's not mine.

220
00:14:23,106 --> 00:14:27,910
One credit card receipt for
Swedish-made penis enlarger

221
00:14:27,977 --> 00:14:29,912
signed by Austin Powers...

222
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:32,381
I'm telling you,
baby, that's not mine.

223
00:14:32,449 --> 00:14:36,585
One warranty card for
Swedish-made penis enlarger pump

224
00:14:36,653 --> 00:14:38,587
filled out by... Austin Powers...

225
00:14:38,655 --> 00:14:40,622
I don't even know what this is.

226
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:43,092
This sort of thing
ain't my bag, baby.

227
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,627
<i>One book: Swedish-made
penis enlarger pumps and me:</i>

230
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:55,137
Uh...Just sign the form.

231
00:14:55,205 --> 00:14:57,223
Ok, don't get heavy,
man, I'll sign it,

232
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:59,958
just to get things
moving, you know.

233
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,727
You're all right, baby.

234
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:03,996
Listen, Mr. Powers.

235
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:06,082
I look forward to working with you,

236
00:15:06,149 --> 00:15:08,817
but do me a favor and
stop calling me "baby."

237
00:15:08,885 --> 00:15:12,354
You can address me
as... Agent Kensington.

238
00:15:12,422 --> 00:15:13,655
Oh, come on.

239
00:15:15,092 --> 00:15:16,992
All right, then... Vanessa.

240
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,760
Was that so hard?

241
00:15:19,896 --> 00:15:22,364
Now come along. We have
to leave immediately.

242
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:25,334
We preserved your private
jet just as you left it.

243
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:27,169
It's waiting at Heathrow airport.

244
00:15:27,237 --> 00:15:30,206
My jumbo jet! Smashing, baby!

245
00:15:30,273 --> 00:15:31,840
Oop...Sorry.

246
00:15:32,742 --> 00:15:34,009
Mr. Powers?

247
00:15:37,614 --> 00:15:39,181
Quickly.

248
00:15:39,249 --> 00:15:41,517
Quickly. Come on, lad. Let's go.

249
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:59,001
Dr. Evil: Gentlemen, welcome
to my underground lair.

250
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:02,288
It's been 30 years, but I'm back.

251
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:04,490
Everything's gone perfectly to plan

252
00:16:04,558 --> 00:16:06,625
except for one
small flaw--

253
00:16:06,693 --> 00:16:09,962
due to a technical error
by my henchman Mustafa,

254
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:14,083
complications arose in
the unfreezing process.

255
00:16:14,518 --> 00:16:16,602
But my design was perfect.

256
00:16:16,669 --> 00:16:19,671
Look what you did
to Mr. Bigglesworth!

257
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:24,326
But, Dr. Evil, we were
unable to anticipate

258
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:27,563
feline complications to
the reanimation process--

259
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:28,865
silence!

260
00:16:28,932 --> 00:16:30,649
Aah!

261
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:34,536
Aaaaaaaaah!

262
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:39,191
Let this be a reminder to you all

263
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,161
that this organization
will not tolerate failure.

[Mustafa moans in agony]

265
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:51,170
Gentlemen, let's
get down to business.

00:16:51,238 --> 00:16:54,807
[Mustafa moans in agony]

267
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,042
We've got a lot of work to do.

268
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,778
Mustafa: Someone help me!

269
00:16:58,845 --> 00:17:02,881
I-I'm...Still alive, only
I'm very... Badly burned.

270
00:17:04,751 --> 00:17:06,252
Some of you I know,

271
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,854
some of you I'm meeting
for the first time.

272
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:12,224
Mustafa: Ah-ah! Hello
out there! Anyone!

273
00:17:12,659 --> 00:17:13,893
Could someone call an ambulance?

274
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,295
I'm in quite... A lot of pain.

275
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:18,597
Ok, you've all been
gathered here to form--

276
00:17:18,665 --> 00:17:21,600
ohhh! Excuse me.

277
00:17:21,668 --> 00:17:23,302
Yes. He's down there.

278
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,105
No, not dead--
burned. Badly.

279
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:29,941
Yes.

280
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:31,943
Right.

281
00:17:32,011 --> 00:17:33,279
Mustafa: If somebody

282
00:17:33,346 --> 00:17:35,481
could open the retrieval
hatch down here,

283
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:36,615
I could get out.

284
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:38,450
See, I designed
this device myself--

285
00:17:38,518 --> 00:17:40,619
[hatch opens] Oh! Hi. Good.

286
00:17:40,687 --> 00:17:42,621
I'm glad you found me. Listen...

287
00:17:42,689 --> 00:17:43,955
I'm very badly burned,

288
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:45,457
so if you
could just--

289
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:47,159
[gunshot]

290
00:17:47,227 --> 00:17:48,827
You shot me!

291
00:17:48,895 --> 00:17:50,296
Ok, moving
along--

292
00:17:50,363 --> 00:17:52,130
you shot me right in the arm!

293
00:17:52,199 --> 00:17:53,131
Why
did--

294
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,300
[gunshot]

295
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,860
[Retrieval hatch closes]

296
00:18:04,928 --> 00:18:06,062
Right.

297
00:18:06,129 --> 00:18:08,931
Let me go around the table
and introduce everyone.

298
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:14,070
Frau Farbissina: Founder of the
militant wing of the salvation army.

299
00:18:14,504 --> 00:18:17,607
Random task: Korean ex-wrestler,

300
00:18:17,674 --> 00:18:20,676
Evil handyman extraordinaire.

301
00:18:20,744 --> 00:18:24,096
Random task, show them what you do.

302
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,441
[Neck cracking]

303
00:18:37,944 --> 00:18:38,944
Patty o'brien:

304
00:18:39,011 --> 00:18:41,113
Ex-Irish assassin.

305
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,299
His trademark-- a
superstitious man,

306
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:46,785
he leaves a tiny keepsake
from his good luck bracelet

307
00:18:46,853 --> 00:18:48,653
on every victim he kills.

308
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:51,173
Scotland yard would
love to get their hands

309
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:53,643
on that piece of evidence.

310
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,695
[Irish accent] Yeah, they're
always after me lucky charms.

311
00:18:56,763 --> 00:18:59,331
[Tittering]

312
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:01,166
[Chortling]

313
00:19:01,234 --> 00:19:05,470
What? Why's everyone always
laugh when I say that?

314
00:19:05,538 --> 00:19:08,090
<i>They are after me lucky charms!</i>

315
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:09,875
What?

316
00:19:09,943 --> 00:19:13,312
[German accent] It's a
television commercial...

317
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,697
With this cartoon leprechaun,

318
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:18,000
and all of these childrens
are trying to chase him--

319
00:19:18,068 --> 00:19:19,902
"hey, leprechaun man!

320
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:22,622
Won't you give your lucky charms?"

321
00:19:22,689 --> 00:19:23,839
Oh, and there's always

322
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:26,008
these little, tiny
bits of marshmallows

323
00:19:26,075 --> 00:19:27,676
just stuck right in the cereal

324
00:19:27,744 --> 00:19:29,678
so that when the kids
eat them, they think,

325
00:19:29,746 --> 00:19:31,981
"oh, this is candy.
I'm having fun!"

326
00:19:35,251 --> 00:19:37,669
Finally, we come to
my number-two man.

327
00:19:37,737 --> 00:19:40,005
His name:

328
00:19:40,073 --> 00:19:41,307
Number Two.

329
00:19:41,374 --> 00:19:44,343
For 30 years, number
Two has run virtucon,

330
00:19:44,411 --> 00:19:47,513
the legitimate face
of my evil empire.

331
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:52,334
Dr. Evil, over the last 30 years,

332
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:55,103
virtucon has grown
by leaps and bounds.

333
00:19:55,171 --> 00:19:59,975
About 15 years ago, we
changed from volatile chemicals

334
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:03,045
to the communications industry.

335
00:20:03,113 --> 00:20:06,165
We own cable
companies in 38 states.

336
00:20:06,233 --> 00:20:08,834
We own a steel mill in Cleveland,

337
00:20:09,302 --> 00:20:12,388
shipping in Texas, oil
refineries in Seattle,

338
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:13,805
and a factory in Chicago

339
00:20:13,873 --> 00:20:16,675
that makes miniature
models of factories.

340
00:20:16,743 --> 00:20:19,011
Naturally, yes.

341
00:20:19,078 --> 00:20:20,146
Gentlemen...

342
00:20:22,582 --> 00:20:24,150
I have a plan.

343
00:20:28,087 --> 00:20:29,321
[Meow]

344
00:20:34,093 --> 00:20:36,162
It's called blackmail.

345
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:38,831
As you know, the
royal family of britain

346
00:20:38,899 --> 00:20:41,500
are the wealthiest
landowners in the world.

347
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:45,604
Either the royal family pays us
an exorbitant amount of money,

348
00:20:45,672 --> 00:20:48,874
or we make it seem
that prince Charles

349
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:50,659
has had an affair
outside of marriage,

350
00:20:50,726 --> 00:20:54,696
and therefore...
Would have to divorce.

351
00:20:55,765 --> 00:20:57,299
Ahem.

352
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:59,368
Prince Charles did have an affair,

353
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:02,237
he admitted it, and
they are now divorced.

354
00:21:02,305 --> 00:21:03,539
Right. Ok, people,

355
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:06,091
you have to tell me
these things, all right?

356
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,711
I've been frozen for 30 years, ok?

357
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:12,047
Throw me a frickin' bone here.

358
00:21:12,114 --> 00:21:16,235
I'm the boss. Need the info.

359
00:21:16,303 --> 00:21:18,070
Ok, no problem.

360
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:19,672
Here's my second plan:

361
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:21,039
Back in the sixties,

362
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:23,041
I developed a
weather-changing machine,

363
00:21:23,109 --> 00:21:27,313
which was, in essence, a sophisticated
heat beam which we called a "laser."

364
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:30,482
Using these "lasers,"
we punch a hole

365
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,884
in the protective
layer around the world,

366
00:21:32,952 --> 00:21:36,054
which we call the "ozone" layer.

367
00:21:36,122 --> 00:21:39,808
Slowly, but surely,
ultraviolet rays would pour in,

368
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:42,561
increasing the risk of skin cancer.

369
00:21:42,628 --> 00:21:49,902
That is unless... the world
pays us... A hefty ransom.

370
00:21:51,504 --> 00:21:52,905
Ahem.

371
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:58,376
That also... already has happened.

372
00:21:58,444 --> 00:21:59,878
Shit.

373
00:22:01,748 --> 00:22:04,149
Oh, hell, let's just
do what we always do--

374
00:22:04,217 --> 00:22:07,786
hijack some nuclear weapons and
hold the world hostage. Good.

375
00:22:07,854 --> 00:22:09,855
Gentlemen, it's
come to my attention

376
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:12,191
that a breakaway Russian
Republic-- kreplachistan--

377
00:22:12,258 --> 00:22:14,526
is about to transfer
a nuclear warhead

378
00:22:14,594 --> 00:22:16,895
to the united
nations in a few days.

379
00:22:16,963 --> 00:22:18,496
Here's the plan:

380
00:22:18,564 --> 00:22:23,869
We get the warhead, and we
hold the world ransom for...

381
00:22:23,937 --> 00:22:27,305
$1 million!

382
00:22:27,373 --> 00:22:29,157
Ahem.

383
00:22:30,577 --> 00:22:32,561
Don't you think we should maybe ask

384
00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:34,563
for more than a million dollars?

385
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:38,601
A million dollars isn't exactly
a lot of money these days.

386
00:22:38,668 --> 00:22:42,220
Virtucon alone makes
over $9 billion a year.

387
00:22:42,288 --> 00:22:43,689
Really? Mm-hmm.

388
00:22:43,757 --> 00:22:45,891
That's a lot more.

389
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,393
Ok, then.

390
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,229
We hold the world ransom for...

391
00:22:51,297 --> 00:22:55,567
$100...Billion!

392
00:22:59,656 --> 00:23:02,057
Pretty groovy jumbo jet, eh?

393
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,226
When you see this jet a-rockin',

394
00:23:04,293 --> 00:23:06,495
don't come a-knockin', baby! Yeah!

395
00:23:06,563 --> 00:23:09,031
I'm going to need you to
sign these release forms.

396
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:09,999
Release forms?

397
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:12,017
Yes. You're not officially working

398
00:23:12,084 --> 00:23:13,318
for ministry of defence,

399
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:15,687
and these forms indemnify
the ministry against any...

400
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:18,174
Mishaps that may occur
in the line of duty.

401
00:23:18,241 --> 00:23:20,176
Mishaps? But isn't that what being

402
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:24,463
an international man
of mystery's all about?

403
00:23:24,531 --> 00:23:29,218
Ok. "Name." Austin...
Danger Powers.

404
00:23:29,286 --> 00:23:31,904
"Sex." Yes, please!

405
00:23:31,971 --> 00:23:33,906
How does a hot chick like you

406
00:23:33,973 --> 00:23:37,159
end up working in the
ministry of defence?

407
00:23:37,226 --> 00:23:39,411
Oh. Well, I went to Oxford,

408
00:23:39,479 --> 00:23:41,680
where I excelled
in several subjects,

409
00:23:41,748 --> 00:23:44,516
but I ended up specializing
in foreign languages.

410
00:23:44,584 --> 00:23:46,184
I really wanted to travel.

411
00:23:46,252 --> 00:23:48,587
You know, sort of see the world?

412
00:23:48,655 --> 00:23:49,438
That's fascinating, Vanessa.

413
00:23:49,506 --> 00:23:51,807
Listen, why don't we
go in the back and shag?

414
00:23:51,874 --> 00:23:53,091
What?

415
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:54,343
I've been frozen for 30 years.

416
00:23:54,411 --> 00:23:56,812
I've gotta see if my bits
and pieces are still working.

417
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:58,113
Excuse me?

418
00:23:58,181 --> 00:23:59,715
My wedding tackle.

419
00:23:59,782 --> 00:24:00,749
I'm
sorry--

my twig and berries.

421
00:24:03,486 --> 00:24:05,387
Hello, lads, you still awake?

422
00:24:05,455 --> 00:24:06,605
Mr. Powers, please.

423
00:24:06,673 --> 00:24:07,539
I'd appreciate it

424
00:24:07,606 --> 00:24:09,875
if you could concentrate
on our mission

425
00:24:09,943 --> 00:24:12,577
and give your libido a rest.

426
00:24:13,512 --> 00:24:15,747
Can I, uh...

427
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:17,883

All right.

434
00:24:43,542 --> 00:24:47,212
Let me ask you a
question, and be honest.

435
00:24:48,214 --> 00:24:49,181
Oh!

436

the unfreezing process.

446
00:25:12,522 --> 00:25:14,456
and I was the last woman on earth

447
00:25:14,524 --> 00:25:16,125
and the future of the human race

depended on our having
sex simply for procreation,

449
00:25:18,695 --> 00:25:21,196
I still would not
have sex with you.

450

00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:40,492
Could I have a hug?

No.

Give me a hug. No way.

Come here. I'm not
coming over there.

Which side of the bed do you want?

00:27:56,769 --> 00:27:59,371
You're sleeping on
the sofa, Mr. Powers.

498
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:02,624
In fact, I'd like to take
this opportunity to remind you

499
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:04,376
that the only reason
we're sharing a room

500
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:05,543
is to keep up the context

501
00:28:05,611 --> 00:28:07,261
that we're a married
couple on vacation.

502
00:28:07,329 --> 00:28:08,697
Right.

503
00:28:08,764 --> 00:28:11,766
Should we shag now,
or shall we shag later?

Personally, before I'm on the job,

No, but that's where

00:49:20,451 --> 00:49:23,888
Caliber--it's
a homonym.

915
00:49:26,858 --> 00:49:27,925
Forget it.

916
00:49:31,546 --> 00:49:32,946
At ease, boys.

917
00:49:34,849 --> 00:49:38,752
Austin, I want to
show you something.

918
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,721
We're going to
outfit you with this.

919
00:49:40,788 --> 00:49:41,872
It looks like a watch,

920
00:49:41,939 --> 00:49:45,775
but in fact it's a
geosynchronous positioning device.

921
00:49:45,843 --> 00:49:47,211
Very shagadelic.

922
00:49:47,278 --> 00:49:50,080
And then there's this.

923
00:49:50,148 --> 00:49:51,448
Ok, let me guess.

924
00:49:51,516 --> 00:49:52,850
The floss is garrote wire,

925
00:49:52,917 --> 00:49:56,353
the toothpaste is
plastic explosives,

926
00:49:56,421 --> 00:49:59,590
and the toothbrush is
the detonation device.

927
00:49:59,657 --> 00:50:00,991
No, actually.

928
00:50:01,058 --> 00:50:02,993
Well, since you've been frozen,

929
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:04,528
there have been fabulous advances

930
00:50:04,596 --> 00:50:05,929
in the field of dentistry.

931
00:50:05,997 --> 00:50:08,231
W-what do you mean?

932
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:09,533
Nothing.

933
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:11,618
Oh, look, here's basil.

934
00:50:11,686 --> 00:50:12,586
Hello, exposition.

935
00:50:12,654 --> 00:50:13,620
Austin.

936
00:50:13,688 --> 00:50:15,956
Let me bring you up to speed.

937
00:50:16,024 --> 00:50:18,859
Dr. Evil has hijacked
a nuclear warhead

938
00:50:18,927 --> 00:50:20,161
from kreplachistan.

939
00:50:20,228 --> 00:50:22,229
Only 2 things scare me,

940
00:50:22,297 --> 00:50:24,531
and one is nuclear war.

941
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:25,800
What's the other?

942
00:50:25,867 --> 00:50:26,834
Excuse me?

943
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:28,535
What's the other
thing that scares you?

944
00:50:29,504 --> 00:50:30,871
Carnies.

945
00:50:30,939 --> 00:50:31,906
What?

946
00:50:31,973 --> 00:50:33,407
Circus folk.

947
00:50:33,474 --> 00:50:34,741
Nomads, you know.

948
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:36,576
Smell like cabbage.

949
00:50:36,644 --> 00:50:38,378
Small hands.

950
00:50:38,446 --> 00:50:40,981
Oh...Indeed.

951
00:50:41,049 --> 00:50:43,651
Perhaps these photographs are
the last piece of the puzzle.

952
00:50:43,718 --> 00:50:44,718
Aha.

953
00:50:44,786 --> 00:50:47,070
I've uncovered the
details of project vulcan.

954
00:50:47,138 --> 00:50:50,106
Oh, good God. An
underground missile?

955
00:50:50,174 --> 00:50:51,825
Austin, where did you find these?

956
00:50:51,893 --> 00:50:54,027
Austin did some
reconnaissance work last night

957
00:50:54,095 --> 00:50:56,597
at Alotta Fagina's penthouse.

958
00:50:56,665 --> 00:50:57,665
Oh.

959
00:50:57,732 --> 00:51:01,101
Our next move is to
infiltrate virtucon.

960
00:51:01,169 --> 00:51:03,437
Any ideas?

961
00:51:03,505 --> 00:51:04,638
Oh, yes.

962
00:51:04,706 --> 00:51:07,808
Virtucon runs a tour of
its facility every hour.

963
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:10,777
I thought perhaps we could
disguise ourselves as tourists

964
00:51:10,845 --> 00:51:13,380
and do some onsite reconnaissance.

965
00:51:13,448 --> 00:51:15,115
Top drawer, Kensington.

966
00:51:15,183 --> 00:51:18,952
Oh, uh, Austin, I'd like
you to meet somebody.

967
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,521
This is
my mother--

968
00:51:20,589 --> 00:51:21,988
Mrs. exposition.

969
00:51:22,056 --> 00:51:23,957
How do you do?

970
00:51:24,742 --> 00:51:26,109
Vanessa: Austin!

971
00:51:27,178 --> 00:51:28,879
My God, man, what have you done?

972
00:51:28,947 --> 00:51:32,115
That's not your mother.
It's a man, baby!

973
00:51:32,183 --> 00:51:33,951
Get off! Get off! Come on!

974
00:51:34,018 --> 00:51:36,587
Why won't this wig come off?!

975
00:51:36,654 --> 00:51:38,088
Uhh! Uhh!

976
00:51:38,155 --> 00:51:39,089
Austin!

977
00:51:39,156 --> 00:51:40,557
Yeah, hold on. Hold on one second.

978
00:51:40,625 --> 00:51:42,425
No, no. Let go of my mother!

979
00:51:42,494 --> 00:51:44,294
Oh...Oh, mother.

980
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:45,562
Mother, are you all right?

981
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:47,798
Austin, have you gone mad?

982
00:51:47,866 --> 00:51:49,032
No.

983
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,568
You have a lot of explaining to do.

984
00:51:51,636 --> 00:51:54,371
I'm sorry, basil. I
thought she was a man.

985
00:51:54,438 --> 00:51:57,140
Damn it, man, you're
talking about my mother!

986
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,009
Well, you have to admit,
she is rather mannish.

987
00:51:59,076 --> 00:52:00,010
Austin!

988
00:52:00,077 --> 00:52:01,044
Well, no offense,

989
00:52:01,112 --> 00:52:02,412
but if that is a woman,

990
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,682
it does look like she was
beaten with an ugly stick.

991
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,784
Really, Austin.

992
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:17,961
Ok, give in to the beauty of
your feelings and say the words.

993
00:52:18,029 --> 00:52:19,629
Come on.

994
00:52:19,697 --> 00:52:22,616
I love you, dad.

995
00:52:22,683 --> 00:52:26,320
I love you, too, son.

996
00:52:30,574 --> 00:52:32,209
Ok, group,

997
00:52:32,276 --> 00:52:34,327
we have some newcomers
here today with us.

998
00:52:34,395 --> 00:52:39,366
Say hello to Scott and
his father Mr. avil?

999
00:52:39,433 --> 00:52:41,902
Evil, actually.

1000
00:52:43,972 --> 00:52:47,107
Dr. Evil.

1001
00:52:47,175 --> 00:52:50,777
All: Hello, Dr. Evil. Hello, Scott.

1002
00:52:50,845 --> 00:52:52,479
Hello, everybody.

1003
00:52:52,546 --> 00:52:53,947
So, Scott, why don't
we start with you?

1004
00:52:54,015 --> 00:52:57,384
What brings you here with us today?

1005
00:52:57,451 --> 00:52:59,303
Well, I just really met my dad

1006
00:52:59,371 --> 00:53:00,737
for the first time 5 days ago.

1007
00:53:00,805 --> 00:53:03,607
I was partially
frozen his whole life.

1008
00:53:03,674 --> 00:53:05,659
That is beautiful

1009
00:53:05,726 --> 00:53:07,928
that you can admit to that.

1010
00:53:07,996 --> 00:53:08,812
He comes back,

1011
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,115
and now he wants me to take
over the family business.

1012
00:53:11,182 --> 00:53:14,684
But, Scott, who's going to
take over the world when I die?

1013
00:53:14,752 --> 00:53:16,553
Listen to the
words he used--

1014
00:53:16,621 --> 00:53:19,406
"who's going to take over
the world when I die?"

1015
00:53:19,474 --> 00:53:23,710
It feels like that to some
of us sometimes, doesn't it?

1016
00:53:23,778 --> 00:53:26,813
<i>So what do you want to do, Scott?</i>

1017
00:53:26,881 --> 00:53:27,514
I don't know.

1018
00:53:27,581 --> 00:53:30,150
I was thinking I like animals.

1019
00:53:30,218 --> 00:53:31,185
Maybe I'd be a vet.

1020
00:53:31,252 --> 00:53:32,820
An evil vet?

1021
00:53:32,887 --> 00:53:35,588
No. Maybe, like,
work in a petting zoo.

1022
00:53:35,656 --> 00:53:37,524
An evil petting zoo?

1023
00:53:37,591 --> 00:53:39,226
You always do that!

1024
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:44,064
I just think, like, he hates me.

1025
00:53:44,132 --> 00:53:46,433
I really think he wants to kill me.

1026
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,553
Now, Scott, we don't want
to kill each other in here.

1027
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:51,521
We might say that we do sometimes,

1028
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:54,023
but we really don't.

1029
00:53:54,092 --> 00:53:55,758
Actually, the boy's quite astute.

1030
00:53:55,826 --> 00:53:57,861
I really am trying to kill him,

1031
00:53:57,929 --> 00:54:00,164
but so far, unsuccessfully.

1032
00:54:00,231 --> 00:54:02,899
He's quite wily like his old man.

1033
00:54:04,669 --> 00:54:07,571
This is what I'm talking about.

1034
00:54:07,638 --> 00:54:10,574
Ok, well, we've
heard from you, Scott.

1035
00:54:10,641 --> 00:54:14,344
Now, uh, you tell us
something about yourself.

1036
00:54:14,412 --> 00:54:17,531
The details of my life
are quite inconsequential.

1037
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,082
Oh, no, please, please.

1038
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:20,917
Let's hear about your childhood.

1039
00:54:20,985 --> 00:54:22,819
Yeah. Come on.

1040
00:54:25,373 --> 00:54:26,773
Very well.

1041
00:54:26,841 --> 00:54:28,808
Where do I begin?

1042
00:54:28,876 --> 00:54:31,978
My father was a
relentlessly self-improving

1043
00:54:32,046 --> 00:54:33,780
<i>boulangerie owner from Belgium</i>

1044
00:54:33,848 --> 00:54:37,117
with low-grade narcolepsy
and a penchant for buggery.

1045
00:54:37,285 --> 00:54:42,990
My mother was a 15-year-old French
prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet.

1046
00:54:43,057 --> 00:54:45,859
My father would
womanize, he would drink.

1047
00:54:45,926 --> 00:54:47,894
He would make outrageous claims

1048
00:54:47,962 --> 00:54:50,364
like he invented the question mark.

1049
00:54:50,431 --> 00:54:54,334
Sometimes he would accuse
chestnuts of being lazy,

1050
00:54:54,402 --> 00:55:01,174
the sort of general malaise that only
the genius possess and the insane lament.

1051
00:55:01,242 --> 00:55:03,377
My childhood was typical.

1052
00:55:03,444 --> 00:55:06,880
Summers in rangoon, luge lessons.

1053
00:55:06,947 --> 00:55:10,083
In the spring, we'd
make meat helmets.

1054
00:55:10,151 --> 00:55:15,589
When I was insolent, I was placed in
a burlap bag and beaten with reeds.

1055
00:55:15,657 --> 00:55:17,557
Pretty standard, really.

1056
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:20,244
At the age of 12, I
received my first scribe.

1057
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:22,079
At the age of 14,

1058
00:55:22,147 --> 00:55:25,982
a zoroastrian named vilma
ritualistically shaved my testicles.

1059
00:55:26,051 --> 00:55:28,985
There really is nothing
like a shorn scrotum.

1060
00:55:29,054 --> 00:55:32,322
It's breathtaking.
I suggest you try it.

1061
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:35,092
You know, we have to stop.

1062
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,044
Vanessa: Austin, can
I have a word with you?

1063
00:55:38,112 --> 00:55:40,046
Of course you may, love.

1064
00:55:41,782 --> 00:55:44,184
Look, I know I'm being neurotic,

1065
00:55:44,252 --> 00:55:48,755
but I can't shake off this suspicious
feeling about that Italian secretary.

1066
00:55:48,823 --> 00:55:50,090
You know, miss fagina.

1067
00:55:50,158 --> 00:55:51,992
I don't want to sound paranoid,

1068
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:54,995
but I've had some bad
relationships in the past,

1069
00:55:55,063 --> 00:55:57,564
and I have been
known to be jealous.

1070
00:55:57,631 --> 00:55:58,531
I'm sorry.

1071
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:01,034
No. Don't be sorry, baby.

1072
00:56:01,102 --> 00:56:02,819
You're right to be suspicious.

1073
00:56:02,886 --> 00:56:04,621
I shagged her.

1074
00:56:04,689 --> 00:56:05,822
What?

1075
00:56:05,889 --> 00:56:08,725
I shagged her rotten, baby, yeah!

1076
00:56:08,793 --> 00:56:12,362
I don't believe you,
Austin. She was repellent.

1077
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,981
Saucer of milk, table 2. Meowr.

1078
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:16,483
But did you use protection?

1079
00:56:16,551 --> 00:56:19,386
Of course. I had my 9mm automatic.

1080
00:56:19,454 --> 00:56:22,922
You know I meant
did you use a condom?

1081
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:26,676
Ha ha ha. Only sailors
use condoms, baby.

1082
00:56:26,744 --> 00:56:27,894
Not in the nineties, Austin.

1083
00:56:27,962 --> 00:56:29,679
Well, they should,
those filthy beggars.

1084
00:56:29,747 --> 00:56:31,081
They go from port to port.

1085
00:56:31,149 --> 00:56:34,318
Vanessa, don't have a thrombo.

1086
00:56:34,385 --> 00:56:36,786
Alotta meant nothing to me.

1087
00:56:36,854 --> 00:56:38,255
Well, it means something to me.

1088
00:56:38,323 --> 00:56:40,790
Austin, if you want us
to have a relationship,

1089
00:56:40,858 --> 00:56:43,594
you have to get it into your
head that times have changed.

1090
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:46,363
You can't just go off
shagging anybody anymore.

1091
00:56:46,431 --> 00:56:49,682
And if you could, I wouldn't
because I'm not like that.

1092
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:51,335
Vanessa...

1093
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,255
You're everything to me.

1094
00:56:55,323 --> 00:56:57,790
You just don't get it, do you?

1095
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,027
Good night, Austin.

1096
00:57:01,095 --> 00:57:03,129
Welcome to the nineties.

1097
00:57:03,197 --> 00:57:05,766
You're going to be very lonely.

1098
00:57:27,672 --> 00:57:29,540
Hey. Check this guy out.

1099
00:57:31,176 --> 00:57:32,609
Peace. Peace.

1100
00:57:32,677 --> 00:57:34,545
Yeah.

1101
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:40,400

1103
00:57:42,603 --> 00:57:43,553

1104

Janis joplin.

1105

Astronaut: Oh, gee, that's great.

1112
00:58:22,142 --> 00:58:23,577
Is the lighting halfway decent?

1113
00:58:23,644 --> 00:58:25,479
Announcer: Yes, indeed.
They got the flag up now.

1114
00:58:25,546 --> 00:58:27,296
You can see the stars and stripes.

1115
00:58:27,365 --> 00:58:29,031
Astronaut: Beautiful.
Just beautiful.

Vanessa: Good morning, Austin.

1118
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:37,974
You know, I sometimes forget

1119
00:58:38,041 --> 00:58:41,644
you've missed out
on the last 30 years.

1120
00:58:41,712 --> 00:58:43,613
Fall of the Berlin wall,

1121
00:58:43,681 --> 00:58:45,615

1123
00:58:47,685 --> 00:58:50,620
Yeah, and I can't
believe liberace was gay.

1124
00:58:50,688 --> 00:58:52,655
I mean, women loved him.

1125
00:58:52,723 --> 00:58:55,592
I didn't see that one coming, no.

1126
00:58:55,659 --> 00:58:57,628
Guide: The tour is about to begin,

1127
00:58:57,695 --> 00:59:00,179
so if you'll please
take your seats.

1128
00:59:00,247 --> 00:59:03,049
Welcome to virtucon,
company of the future.

1129
00:59:03,117 --> 00:59:05,218
Virtucon is a leading
manufacturer of many items

1130
00:59:05,286 --> 00:59:07,754
you can find right
in your very own home.

1131
00:59:07,821 --> 00:59:09,672
Do you think she's
prettier than me?

1132
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:10,640
Who?

1133
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:12,141
You know who.

1134
00:59:12,209 --> 00:59:13,643
Oh, the Italian bird.

1135
00:59:13,711 --> 00:59:16,145
No, baby. She's rancid.

1136
00:59:16,213 --> 00:59:18,648
I think you're shagadelic, baby.

1137
00:59:18,716 --> 00:59:21,017
You're switched
on. You're smashing.

1138
00:59:21,084 --> 00:59:25,488
We make steel, petroleum
products, and volatile chemicals.

1139
00:59:25,556 --> 00:59:28,692
But don't worry about
the Italian bird, ok?

1140
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,694
She's the village bicycle.

1141
00:59:30,762 --> 00:59:33,863
Everyone's had a ride.

1142
00:59:33,931 --> 00:59:38,668
On your right, you'll notice a
door leading to a restricted area.

1143
00:59:38,736 --> 00:59:40,703
Only authorized
personnel are allowed...

1144
00:59:40,771 --> 00:59:41,971
Austin: I'll take him.

1145
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:43,740
You take her.

1146
00:59:55,536 --> 00:59:56,603
All right.

1147
00:59:58,606 --> 01:00:00,139
Let's go.

1148
01:00:00,207 --> 01:00:03,276

01:00:17,858 --> 01:00:19,793
Hang on. I'm going to floor it.

1156

01:00:21,428 --> 01:00:23,229

01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:26,549
Careful, Austin.

1159
01:00:26,617 --> 01:00:31,304
Nooooo!

1160
01:00:31,371 --> 01:00:32,305

1161
01:00:32,372 --> 01:00:33,306

Eew. Ohh.

Let's go. Come on, let's go.

1167
01:00:47,354 --> 01:00:49,623
Oh! Thank goodness
we made it, Austin.

1168
01:00:49,690 --> 01:00:51,891
All right. Stay very cool, baby.

1169
01:00:51,959 --> 01:00:53,093
Ok.

1170
01:01:16,951 --> 01:01:21,955
Mr. Powers, welcome
to my underground lair.

1171
01:01:22,023 --> 01:01:23,923
You're just in time.

1172
01:01:23,991 --> 01:01:26,292
Enjoy the show.

1173
01:01:32,182 --> 01:01:36,202
Gentlemen, I give you the vulcan...

1174
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:40,273
The world's most powerful
subterranean drill.

1175
01:01:40,340 --> 01:01:42,058
Does that make you horny?

1176
01:01:42,126 --> 01:01:43,527
Not now, Austin.

1177
01:01:43,594 --> 01:01:46,530
So powerful it can
penetrate the earth's crust,

1178
01:01:46,597 --> 01:01:48,532
delivering a 50-kiloton
nuclear warhead

1179
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:51,568
deep into the liquid
hot core of the planet.

1180
01:01:51,636 --> 01:01:56,773
Upon detonation, every
volcano on earth will erupt.

1181
01:01:56,841 --> 01:01:58,575
[People gasp]

1182
01:01:58,643 --> 01:01:59,459
[All talking]

1183
01:01:59,527 --> 01:02:01,961
It seems we have no choice

1184
01:02:02,029 --> 01:02:03,797
but to pay your ransom.

1185
01:02:03,864 --> 01:02:06,465
You have my instructions. Bye-bye.

1186
01:02:09,336 --> 01:02:10,520
Check it out, butt-head.

1187
01:02:10,588 --> 01:02:13,590
This chick has 3
boobs. Heh heh heh.

1188
01:02:13,657 --> 01:02:16,125
How many butts does she have?

1189
01:02:18,045 --> 01:02:22,915
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1190
01:02:22,983 --> 01:02:26,419
Do you like your quasi-futuristic
clothes, Mr. Powers?

1191
01:02:26,487 --> 01:02:29,088
I designed them myself.

1192
01:02:41,835 --> 01:02:42,935
Oww!

1193
01:02:44,104 --> 01:02:47,006
Scott! Scott, my boy, how are you?

1194
01:02:47,074 --> 01:02:48,575
How was your day?

1195
01:02:48,642 --> 01:02:49,842
Well, my friend sweet Jay

1196
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:51,544
took me to that video
arcade in town, right?

1197
01:02:51,612 --> 01:02:53,045
And they don't speak English there,

1198
01:02:53,113 --> 01:02:55,515
so Jay got into a fight, and
he's all, "hey, quit hassling me

1199
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:57,483
'cause I don't speak
French" or whatever.

1200
01:02:57,551 --> 01:02:59,285
And then the guy says
something in Paris talk,

1201
01:02:59,353 --> 01:03:00,920
and I'm like, "just back off."

1202
01:03:00,987 --> 01:03:02,271
And they're all, "get out."

1203
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:03,807
And we're like, "make me."

1204
01:03:03,874 --> 01:03:05,442
It was cool.

1205
01:03:06,444 --> 01:03:08,144
Fascinating.

1206
01:03:08,212 --> 01:03:09,946
What are your plans
for this evening?

1207
01:03:10,013 --> 01:03:11,681
I thought I'd stay in.

1208
01:03:11,749 --> 01:03:13,383
There's a good tittie
movie on skinimax.

1209
01:03:13,451 --> 01:03:16,669
And that's how you'd like
to live your life, is it?

1210
01:03:16,737 --> 01:03:17,920
Yeah.

1211
01:03:18,956 --> 01:03:20,423
Pretty much, right.

1212
01:03:20,491 --> 01:03:22,058
Scott: What?

1213
01:03:23,176 --> 01:03:24,227
[Slap]

1214
01:03:24,295 --> 01:03:25,445
Ow!

1215
01:03:28,199 --> 01:03:31,917
Scott, I want you to
meet daddy's Nemesis,

1216
01:03:31,985 --> 01:03:34,420
Austin Powers.

1217
01:03:34,488 --> 01:03:35,988
What, are you feeding him?

1218
01:03:36,056 --> 01:03:37,490
Why don't you just kill him?

1219
01:03:37,558 --> 01:03:41,026
No, Scott. I have
an even better idea.

1220
01:03:41,094 --> 01:03:44,497
I'm going to place him in
an easily escapable situation

1221
01:03:44,565 --> 01:03:47,333
involving an overly
elaborate and exotic death.

1222
01:03:48,902 --> 01:03:50,453
Scott: Why don't you
just shoot him now?

1223
01:03:50,521 --> 01:03:52,622
I mean, I'll go get a gun.
We'll shoot him together.

1224
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:53,723
It'll be fun. Bang!

1225
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:54,957
Dead. Done.

1226
01:03:55,025 --> 01:03:57,494
One more peep out of you
and you are grounded, mister,

1227
01:03:57,561 --> 01:03:59,129
and I am not joking.

1228
01:04:02,199 --> 01:04:03,533
All right. Let's begin.

1229
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:08,138
Dr. Evil, do you really
expect them to pay?

1230
01:04:08,205 --> 01:04:10,573
No, Mr. Powers.

1231
01:04:10,641 --> 01:04:14,577
I expect them to die.

1232
01:04:14,645 --> 01:04:16,913
Even after they pay me the money,

1233
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:22,018
I'm still going to melt every city
on the planet with liquid hot magma.

1234
01:04:23,721 --> 01:04:25,422
Release the sharks!

1235
01:04:25,489 --> 01:04:27,957
Mr. Powers, you'll
notice that all the sharks

1236
01:04:28,025 --> 01:04:30,460
have laser beams
attached to their heads.

1237
01:04:30,528 --> 01:04:33,612
I figure every creature
deserves a warm meal.

1238
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:38,635
Ahem. Dr. Evil, it's
about the sharks.

1239
01:04:38,702 --> 01:04:43,139
When you were frozen, they were
put on the endangered species list.

1240
01:04:43,206 --> 01:04:45,141
We tried to get some,

1241
01:04:45,208 --> 01:04:48,478
but it would've taken months
to clear up the red tape.

1242
01:04:48,546 --> 01:04:52,148
You know, I have
one simple request,

1243
01:04:52,216 --> 01:04:54,617
and that is to have sharks

1244
01:04:54,685 --> 01:04:57,587
with frickin' laser beams
attached to their heads.

1245
01:04:57,654 --> 01:05:03,275
Now, evidently my cycloptic colleague
informs me that that can't be done.

1246
01:05:03,343 --> 01:05:05,895
Can you remind me what
I pay you people for?

1247
01:05:05,963 --> 01:05:08,665
Honestly, throw me a bone here.

1248
01:05:08,732 --> 01:05:10,282
What do we have?

1249
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:12,202
Sea bass.

1250
01:05:15,539 --> 01:05:17,707
Right.

1251
01:05:17,774 --> 01:05:20,977
They are mutated sea bass.

1252
01:05:21,044 --> 01:05:24,114
Really? Are they ill-tempered?

1253
01:05:24,181 --> 01:05:24,981
Absolutely.

1254
01:05:25,048 --> 01:05:27,550
That's a start, you know.

1255
01:05:27,618 --> 01:05:32,388
All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily
slow-moving dipping mechanism.

1256
01:05:33,273 --> 01:05:34,240
Oh!

1257
01:05:34,307 --> 01:05:36,609
Close the tank!

1258
01:05:37,328 --> 01:05:39,162
A-aren't you even
going to watch them?

1259
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:40,730
They could get away.

1260
01:05:40,797 --> 01:05:43,600
No, no, no. I'm going
to leave them alone

1261
01:05:43,667 --> 01:05:45,635
and not actually
witness them dying.

1262
01:05:45,703 --> 01:05:47,604
I'm just going to assume
it all went to plan--what?

1263
01:05:47,671 --> 01:05:50,640
I have a gun in my room.

1264
01:05:50,708 --> 01:05:51,674
You give me 5 seconds, I'll get it.

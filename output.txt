<i>Water.</i>

<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:05,774 --> 00:00:08,412
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:10,383
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:14,687
<i>My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days.</i>

6
00:00:14,688 --> 00:00:16,326
<i>A time of peace.</i>

7
00:00:16,327 --> 00:00:20,183
<i>When the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom,...</i>

8
00:00:20,184 --> 00:00:22,945
<i>...Fire Nation, and Air Nomads.</i>

9
00:00:22,946 --> 00:00:27,074
<i>But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

10
00:00:29,752 --> 00:00:33,286
<i>Only the Avatar mastered all four elements.</i>

11
00:00:33,287 --> 00:00:36,588
<i>Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders.</i>

12
00:00:36,589 --> 00:00:42,413
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

13
00:00:42,891 --> 00:00:48,242
<i>A hundred years have passed and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war.</i>

14
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:50,739
<i>Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe...</i>

15
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:54,116
<i>...journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation.</i>

16
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:58,072
<i>Leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe.</i>

17
00:00:58,073 --> 00:01:02,209
<i>Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads.</i>

18
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,306
<i>And that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope.</i>

19
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:12,154
<i>I still believe that somehow the Avatar will return to save the world.</i>

Thanks to Acastus and Pandora.

23
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:58,633
It's not getting away from me this time.

24
00:01:58,634 --> 00:02:03,065
Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.

25
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:14,013
Sokka, look!

26
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:17,605
Shhh~ Katara, you're gonna scare it away.

27
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:20,253
Mmmm, I can already smell it cookin'!

28
00:02:20,254 --> 00:02:23,432
But Sokka! I caught one!

29
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:25,802
Hey!

30
00:02:25,803 --> 00:02:26,855
Ugh!

31
00:02:27,423 --> 00:02:32,922
Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?

32
00:02:32,923 --> 00:02:36,601
Ah~ It's not magic. It's waterbending, and it's...

33
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:40,912
Yeah, yeah, an ancient art unique to our culture, blah blah blah...

34
00:02:40,913 --> 00:02:44,809
Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself.

35
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,602
You're calling me weird?

36
00:02:46,603 --> 00:02:48,918
I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself...

37
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:53,015
...everytime I see my reflection in the water.

38
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,632
Watch out!

39
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:12,510
Go left! Go left!

40
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:25,506
You call that left?

41
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:26,607
You don't like my steering.

42
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:30,225
Well, maybe you should have waterbended us out of the ice.

43
00:03:30,226 --> 00:03:31,423
So it's my fault?

44
00:03:31,424 --> 00:03:33,323
I knew I should have left you home.

45
00:03:33,324 --> 00:03:37,012
Leave it to a girl to screw things up.

46
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:42,105
You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained...

47
00:03:42,106 --> 00:03:46,113
...ugh, I'm embarrassed to be related to you!

48
00:03:47,032 --> 00:03:50,111
Ever since Mom died I've been doing all the work around camp...

49
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:51,904
...while you've been off playing soldier!

50
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:53,903
Uh... Katara?

51
00:03:53,904 --> 00:03:56,512
I even wash all the clothes!

52
00:03:56,513 --> 00:04:01,605
Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, not pleasant!!

53
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:03,606
Katara! Settle down!

54
00:04:03,607 --> 00:04:06,702
No, that's it. I'm done helping you.

55
00:04:06,703 --> 00:04:11,224
From now on, you're on your own!

56
00:04:22,823 --> 00:04:25,606
Okay, you've gone from weird to freakish, Katara.

57
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:27,608
You mean I did that?

58
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:30,814
Yup. Congratulations.

59
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:05,420
He's alive! We have to help.

60
00:05:05,421 --> 00:05:10,456
Katara! Get back here! We don't know what that thing is!

61
00:05:42,725 --> 00:05:47,014
Finally. Uncle, do you realize what this means?

62
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:49,325
I won't get to finish my game?

63
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:53,926
It means my search. It's about to come to an end.

64
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:59,208
That light came from an incredibly powerful source. It has to be him!

65
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:05,905
Or it's just the celestial lights. We've been down this road before, Prince Zuko.

66
00:06:05,906 --> 00:06:10,231
I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.

67
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:16,802
Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea?

68
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:20,906
I don't need any calming tea! I need to capture the Avatar.

69
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:25,024
Helmsman, head a course for the light!

70
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:44,613
Stop!

71
00:06:58,314 --> 00:06:59,953
Stop it!

72
00:07:11,032 --> 00:07:13,708
I need to ask you something.

73
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:14,964
What?

74
00:07:14,965 --> 00:07:17,104
Please... come closer.

75
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:19,556
What is it?

76
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,168
Will you go penguin sledding with me?

77
00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:26,542
Uh... sure. I guess.

78
00:07:27,076 --> 00:07:28,382
What's going on here?

79
00:07:28,383 --> 00:07:29,582
You tell us!

80
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,821
How'd you get in the ice? And why aren't you frozen?

81
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:36,172
I'm not sure.

82
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:47,219
Appa! Are you all right? Wake up, buddy.

83
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:58,444
Haha! You're okay!

84
00:08:04,228 --> 00:08:05,752
What is that thing?

85
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,452
This is Appa, my flying bison.

86
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:12,641
Right. And this is Katara, my flying sister.

87
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:25,792
Don't worry. It'll wash out.

88
00:08:26,903 --> 00:08:28,840
So, do you guys live around here?

89
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:30,140
Don't answer that!

90
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,829
Did you see that crazy bolt of light? He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy.

91
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,564
Oh, yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy.

92
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:40,765
You can tell by that evil look in his eye.

93
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:45,519
The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.

94
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,919
I'm A...

95
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:02,597
I'm Aang.

96
00:09:03,135 --> 00:09:06,535
You just sneezed... and flew ten feet in the air.

97
00:09:06,536 --> 00:09:08,335
Really? It felt higher that that.

98
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:10,526
Ah, you're an airbender!

99
00:09:10,527 --> 00:09:11,526
Sure am.

100
00:09:11,527 --> 00:09:14,300
Giant light beams... flying bison... airbenders...

101
00:09:14,301 --> 00:09:16,691
I think I've got Midnight Sun Madness.

102
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:20,595
I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.

103
00:09:23,088 --> 00:09:27,716
Well, if you guys are stuck Appa and I can give you a lift.

104
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,488
We'd love a ride! Thanks!

105
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:34,995
Oh, no... I am not getting on that fluffy snot monster.

106
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:39,361
Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home?

107
00:09:39,362 --> 00:09:43,738
You know... before you freeze to death?

108
00:09:47,134 --> 00:09:50,074
Okay. First time flyers, hold on tight!

109
00:09:50,075 --> 00:09:52,478
Appa, yip yip!

110
00:10:01,072 --> 00:10:03,595
Come on, Appa. Yip yip.

111
00:10:03,596 --> 00:10:06,613
Wow. That was truly amazing.

112
00:10:06,614 --> 00:10:12,567
Appa's just tired. A little rest and he'll be soaring through the sky. You'll see.

113
00:10:14,784 --> 00:10:16,863
Why are you smiling at me like that?

114
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:19,834
Oh... I was smiling?

115
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,031
I'm going to bed now.

116
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,399
Yep. A man needs his rest.

117
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,199
Prince Zuko, you need some sleep.

118
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:54,169
Even if you're right and the Avatar is alive, you won't find him.

119
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:01,074
Your father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all tried and failed.

120
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:05,835
Because their honor didn't hinge on the Avatar's capture. Mine does.

121
00:11:05,836 --> 00:11:09,979
This coward's hundred years in hiding are over.

122
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,418
Hey.

123
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,585
Hey. Whatcha thinkin' about?

124
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:25,570
I guess I was wondering...

125
00:11:25,571 --> 00:11:31,114
...your being an airbender and all... if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar.

126
00:11:31,115 --> 00:11:38,049
Uhh... no. I didn't know him... I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn't. Sorry.

127
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:40,853
Okay. Just curious. Goodnight.

128
00:11:40,854 --> 00:11:43,449
Sleep tight.

129
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,361
Aang! Aang, wake up!

130
00:12:30,362 --> 00:12:36,957
It's okay. We're in the village now. Come on, get ready. Everyone's waiting to meet you.

131
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:57,255
Aang, this is the entire village. Entire village, Aang.

132
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:03,085
Uh... why are they all looking at me like that?

133
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:04,366
Did Appa sneeze on me?

134
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,817
Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years.

135
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:12,833
We thought they were extinct until my granddaughter and grandson found you.

136
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:13,858
Extinct'?

137
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,961
Aang, this is my grandmother.

138
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,753
Call me Gran Gran.

139
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:22,428
What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this.

140
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:27,007
It's not for stabbing. It's for airbending.

141
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,508
Magic trick! Do it again!

142
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:35,199
Not magic, airbending. It lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly.

143
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,965
You know, last time I checked, humans can't fly.

144
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:41,960
Check again!

145
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:46,139
Whoa... it's flying...

146
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,005
...it's amazing!

147
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:06,143
Oh, my watchtower!

148
00:14:07,936 --> 00:14:11,244
That was amazing.

149
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:16,972
Great. You're an airbender,...

150
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:21,188
...Katara's a waterbender, together you can just waste time all day long.

151
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:22,762
You're a waterbender!

152
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:25,054
Well... sort of. Not yet.

153
00:14:25,055 --> 00:14:29,899
All right. No more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores.

154
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,776
I told you! He's the real thing, Gran Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me.

155
00:14:34,777 --> 00:14:38,343
Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy.

156
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,275
But he's special. I can tell.

157
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:44,359
I sense he's filled with much wisdom.

158
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,202
Sthee? Now my tongue ith thuck to my sthaff.

159
00:14:55,065 --> 00:14:57,588
Again.

160
00:15:01,835 --> 00:15:08,471
No! Power in firebending comes from the breath. Not the muscles.

161
00:15:08,472 --> 00:15:11,989
The breath becomes energy in the body.

162
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,734
The energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire.

163
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:18,912
Get it right this time.

164
00:15:18,913 --> 00:15:21,966
Enough. I've been drilling this sequence all day.

165
00:15:21,967 --> 00:15:24,577
Teach me the next set. I'm more than ready.

166
00:15:24,578 --> 00:15:29,517
No, you are impatient. You have yet to master your basics.

167
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:32,242
Drill it again!

168
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:38,746
The sages tell us that the Avatar is the last airbender.

169
00:15:38,747 --> 00:15:41,475
He must be over a hundred years old by now.

170
00:15:41,476 --> 00:15:43,863
He's had a century to master the four elements.

171
00:15:43,864 --> 00:15:47,222
I'll need more than basic firebending to defeat him.

172
00:15:47,223 --> 00:15:51,776
You will teach me the advanced set!

173
00:15:51,777 --> 00:15:58,176
Very well. But first I must finish my roast duck.

174
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:05,249
Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender.

175
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,592
In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing.

176
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:13,540
For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?

177
00:16:14,982 --> 00:16:16,456
I gotta pee!

178
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:19,051
Listen! Until your fathers return from the war,...

179
00:16:19,052 --> 00:16:21,500
...they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe.

180
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:24,053
And that means no potty breaks.

181
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:25,664
But I really gotta go.

182
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:30,703
Ugh... okay... who else has to go?

183
00:16:33,712 --> 00:16:38,499
Have you seen Aang? Gran Gran said he disappeared over an hour ago.

184
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,796
Wow! Everything freezes in there!

185
00:16:41,797 --> 00:16:47,983
Ugh! Katara, get him out of here. This lesson is for warriors only.

186
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:55,347
Stop! Stop it right now!

187
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:59,813
What's wrong with you? We don't have time for fun and games with a war going on.

188
00:16:59,814 --> 00:17:02,599
What war? What are you talking about?

189
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,711
You're kidding, right?

190
00:17:04,712 --> 00:17:08,111
Penguin!

191
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,241
He's kidding, right?

192
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,012
Aang?

193
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:26,271
Hey, come on little guy.

194
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:29,064
Wanna go sledding?

195
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:34,382
Heh heh, I have a way with animals.

196
00:17:37,118 --> 00:17:42,394
Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.

197
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:48,419
You got a deal! Just one little problem. I'm an airbender, not a waterbender.

198
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,196
Isn't there someone in your tribe who can teach you?

199
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:55,734
No. You're looking at the only waterbender on the whole South Pole.

200
00:17:55,735 --> 00:18:00,386
This isn't right. A waterbender needs to master water.

201
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:04,368
What about the North Pole? There's another Water Tribe up there, right?

202
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:06,732
Maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you.

203
00:18:06,733 --> 00:18:11,497
Maybe. But we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time.

204
00:18:11,498 --> 00:18:16,050
It's not exactly... turn right at the second glacier.' It's on the other side of the world.

205
00:18:16,051 --> 00:18:18,687
But you forget, I have a flying bison.

206
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:22,165
Appa and I can personally fly you to the North Pole.

207
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,329
Katara, we're gonna find you a master!

208
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,892
That's... I mean, I don't know.

209
00:18:27,893 --> 00:18:29,554
I've never left home before.

210
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:31,394
Well, you think about it.

211
00:18:31,395 --> 00:18:35,411
But in the meantime, can you teach me to catch one of these penguins?

212
00:18:35,412 --> 00:18:38,634
Okay, listen closely my young pupil.

213
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:45,115
Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. Observe.

214
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:13,614
I haven't done this since I was a kid!

215
00:19:13,615 --> 00:19:16,496
You still are a kid!

216
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:40,917
Whoa... what is that?

217
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:46,824
A Fire Navy ship, and a very bad memory for my people.

218
00:19:48,848 --> 00:19:53,436
Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it. The ship could be booby trapped.

219
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:58,573
If you wanna be a bender, you have to let go of fear.

220
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,948
This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran Gran was a little girl.

221
00:20:46,949 --> 00:20:50,361
It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks.

222
00:20:50,362 --> 00:20:52,064
Okay, back up.

223
00:20:52,065 --> 00:20:56,829
I have friends all over the world, even in the Fire Nation. I've never seen any war.

224
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,125
Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?

225
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:02,566
I don't know... a few days, maybe?

226
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:06,062
I think it was more like a hundred years!

227
00:21:06,063 --> 00:21:10,577
What? That's impossible. Do I look like a hundred-twelve year old man to you?

228
00:21:10,578 --> 00:21:15,698
Think about it. The war is a century old. You don't know about it because...

229
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:22,716
...somehow, you were in there that whole time. It's the only explanation.

230
00:21:22,717 --> 00:21:26,616
A hundred years! I can't believe it.

231
00:21:26,617 --> 00:21:31,777
I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this.

232
00:21:31,778 --> 00:21:34,894
I did get to meet you.

233
00:21:34,895 --> 00:21:38,572
Come on. Let's get out of here.

234
00:21:43,091 --> 00:21:47,942
Aang? Let's head back. This place is creepy.

235
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,190
What's that you said about booby traps?

236
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,598
Hold on tight!

237
00:22:19,681 --> 00:22:25,180
The last airbender. Quite agile for his old age.

238
00:22:25,181 --> 00:22:31,672
Wake my uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar...

239
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:39,489
...as well as his hiding place.

<font color="#ffff00" size=14>www.tvsubtitles.net</font>
1
00:01:02,741 --> 00:01:05,580
Yay! Aang's back!

2
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:16,993
I knew it! You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare!

3
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:18,988
You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?

4
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:21,910
Aang didn't do anything. It was an accident.

5
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:26,066
Yeh, we were on the ship and there was this booby trap and well...

6
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:28,043
...we... we boobied... right into it.

7
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:33,367
Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship. Now we could all be in danger!

8
00:01:33,368 --> 00:01:37,476
Don't blame Katara! I brought her there. It's my fault.

9
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:41,967
Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy!

10
00:01:41,968 --> 00:01:44,831
The foreigner is banned from our village!

11
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:46,934
Sokka, you're making a mistake.

12
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:51,396
No! I'm keeping my promise to Dad. I'm protecting you from threats like him!

13
00:01:51,397 --> 00:01:55,384
Aang is not our enemy! Don't you see?

14
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:59,713
Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time. Fun.

15
00:01:59,714 --> 00:02:03,001
Fun? We can't fight firebenders with fun!

16
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:04,910
You should try it sometime.

17
00:02:04,911 --> 00:02:07,102
Get out of our village. Now!

18
00:02:07,103 --> 00:02:10,505
Grandmother, please, don't let Sokka do this.

19
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:13,038
Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden.

20
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,341
Sokka is right. I think it best if the airbender leaves.

21
00:02:17,342 --> 00:02:20,300
Fine! Then I'm banished too!

22
00:02:20,301 --> 00:02:22,344
C'mon, Aang, let's go!

23
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,676
Where do you think you're going?

24
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:29,158
To find a waterbender! Aang is taking me to the North Pole!

25
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:31,113
I am? Great!

26
00:02:31,114 --> 00:02:38,012
Katara! Would you really choose him over your tribe? Your own family?

27
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:47,873
Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family.

28
00:02:47,874 --> 00:02:52,942
So, you're leaving the South Pole? This is goodbye?

29
00:02:52,943 --> 00:02:55,080
Thanks for penguin sledding with me.

30
00:02:55,081 --> 00:02:56,293
Where will you go?

31
00:02:56,294 --> 00:02:59,874
Guess I'll go back home and look for the airbenders.

32
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:06,683
Wow, I haven't cleaned my room in a hundred years. Not looking forward to that.

33
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,707
It was nice meeting everyone.

34
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:14,038
Let's see your bison fly now, air boy.

35
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,158
Come on, Appa, you can do it! Yip! Yip!

36
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,484
Yeh, I thought so.

37
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,557
Aang! Don't go! We'll miss you!

38
00:03:27,558 --> 00:03:30,455
I'll miss you too.

39
00:03:34,386 --> 00:03:36,959
Come on, boy.

40
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:47,679
Katara, you'll feel better after you...

41
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,633
You happy now? There goes my one chance of becoming a waterbender!

42
00:03:57,806 --> 00:03:59,499
All right! Ready our defenses!

43
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,101
The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!

44
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:02,749
But, I gotta...

45
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,978
And no potty breaks!

46
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:20,716
Yeh, I liked her too.

47
00:04:27,336 --> 00:04:29,630
The village!

48
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:36,023
Appa, wait here!

49
00:05:41,836 --> 00:05:44,909
Oh man!

50
00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:55,810
Ohhh, man!

51
00:06:13,645 --> 00:06:17,088
Sokka, get out of the way!

52
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:31,484
Where are you hiding him?

53
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,694
He'd be about this age? Master of all elements?

54
00:07:50,658 --> 00:07:53,552
I know you're hiding him!

55
00:08:04,825 --> 00:08:08,239
Show no fear!

56
00:08:53,829 --> 00:08:55,723
Hey Katara. Hey Sokka.

57
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:59,762
Hi... Aang. Thanks for comin'.

58
00:09:13,311 --> 00:09:14,769
Looking for me?

59
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:20,040
You're the airbender? You're the Avatar?

60
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,126
Aang?

61
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:23,835
No way.

62
00:09:24,154 --> 00:09:27,286
I've spent years preparing for this encounter.

63
00:09:27,287 --> 00:09:31,671
Training. Meditating. You're just a child!

64
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:34,964
Well, you're just a teenager.

65
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:52,425
If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?

66
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:04,073
No, Aang! Don't do this!

67
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:08,142
Don't worry, Katara, it'll be okay.

68
00:10:11,634 --> 00:10:14,303
Take care of Appa for me until I get back.

69
00:10:14,304 --> 00:10:19,096
Head a course to the Fire Nation. I'm going home.

70
00:10:52,595 --> 00:10:54,805
We have to go after that ship, Sokka.

71
00:10:54,806 --> 00:10:57,533
Aang saved our tribe, now we have to save him.

72
00:10:57,534 --> 00:10:58,472
Katara, I...

73
00:10:58,473 --> 00:11:03,254
Why can't you realize that he's on our side? If we don't help him, no one will.

74
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:05,157
I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and I...

75
00:11:05,158 --> 00:11:10,422
Katara! Are you gonna talk all day or are you comin' with me?

76
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:12,660
Sokka!

77
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:15,650
Get in. We're going to save your boyfriend.

78
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:16,243
He's not my...

79
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:17,588
Whatever.

80
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:20,987
What do you two think you're doing?

81
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:27,491
You'll need these. You have a long journey ahead of you.

82
00:11:28,699 --> 00:11:31,992
It's been so long since I've had hope.

83
00:11:31,993 --> 00:11:36,901
But you brought it back to life, my little waterbender.

84
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:42,550
And you, my brave warrior, be nice to your sister.

85
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:45,381
Yeah... okay, Gran.

86
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,749
Aang is the Avatar. He's the world's only chance.

87
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:57,422
You both found him for a reason. Now your destinies are intertwined with his.

88
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:02,905
There's no way we're gonna catch a war ship with a canoe.

89
00:12:05,487 --> 00:12:06,653
Appa!

90
00:12:06,654 --> 00:12:11,249
You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don't ya?

91
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:18,822
This staff will make an excellent gift for my father.

92
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:23,602
I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks.

93
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:28,966
Take the Avatar to the prison hold. And take this to my quarters.

94
00:12:28,967 --> 00:12:34,037
Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?

95
00:12:47,523 --> 00:12:51,163
So... I guess you never fought an airbender before.

96
00:12:51,164 --> 00:12:54,495
I bet I can take you both with my hands tied behind my back.

97
00:12:54,496 --> 00:12:56,681
Silence!

98
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:18,153
The Avatar has escaped!

99
00:13:23,284 --> 00:13:28,389
Go. Fly. Soar.

100
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,710
Please, Appa, we need your help. Aang needs your help.

101
00:13:31,711 --> 00:13:36,617
Up. Ascend. Elevate.

102
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:40,302
Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa.

103
00:13:40,303 --> 00:13:43,926
Come on. Don't you wanna save Aang?

104
00:13:45,364 --> 00:13:53,925
What was it that kid said? Yee-ha? Hup hup? Wahoo? Uh... yip yip?

105
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,557
You did it, Sokka!

106
00:14:04,558 --> 00:14:09,336
He's flying! He's flying! Katara, he's...!

107
00:14:09,988 --> 00:14:13,951
I mean, big deal, he's flying.

108
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:26,151
You haven't seen my staff around, have you?

109
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:32,790
Thanks anyway!

110
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:58,649
Sorry...

111
00:15:05,384 --> 00:15:07,345
My staff!

112
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,375
Looks like I underestimated you.

113
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,372
What is that?

114
00:16:49,988 --> 00:16:52,526
Appa!

115
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:15,385
Aang! No!

116
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,373
Aang! Aang! Aang...!!

117
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:48,800
Did you see what he just did?

118
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,840
Now that was some waterbending!

119
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:03,552
Aang! Are you okay?

120
00:18:04,356 --> 00:18:08,616
Hey Katara. Hey Sokka. Thanks for coming.

121
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:11,141
Well, I couldn't let you have all the glory.

122
00:18:11,142 --> 00:18:12,433
I dropped my staff.

123
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:14,500
Got it!

124
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:28,957
Ha! That's from the Water Tribe!

125
00:18:37,677 --> 00:18:39,757
Katara!

126
00:18:50,406 --> 00:18:51,670
Hurry up, Sokka!

127
00:18:51,671 --> 00:18:57,970
I'm just a guy with a boomerang, I didn't ask for all this flying and magic.

128
00:18:57,971 --> 00:19:00,821
Yip yip! Yip yip!

129
00:19:11,394 --> 00:19:14,328
Shoot them down!

130
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:45,099
Good news for the Fire Lord. The Fire Nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.

131
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,765
That kid, Uncle, just did this. I won't underestimate him again.

132
00:19:50,766 --> 00:19:54,422
Dig this ship out and follow them!

133
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,024
As soon as you're done with that.

134
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:09,865
How did you do that? With the water? It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.

135
00:20:09,866 --> 00:20:13,717
I don't know. I just sort of... did it.

136
00:20:13,718 --> 00:20:17,129
Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?

137
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,950
Because... I never wanted to be.

138
00:20:30,349 --> 00:20:33,910
But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return...

139
00:20:33,911 --> 00:20:36,165
...and finally put an end to this war.

140
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,325
And how am I going to do that?

141
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:43,570
According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?

142
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:45,374
That's what the monks told me.

143
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:49,384
Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending.

144
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:51,160
We can learn it together!

145
00:20:51,161 --> 00:20:55,086
And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.

146
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:58,430
I'd like that. I'd really like that.

147
00:20:58,431 --> 00:21:00,250
Then we're in this together.

148
00:21:00,251 --> 00:21:02,339
All right, but before I learn waterbending...

149
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,528
...we have some serious business to attend to here, here, and here.

150
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,156
What's there?

151
00:21:09,157 --> 00:21:11,187
Here we'll ride the hopping llamas.

152
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:14,801
Then waaaay over here we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish.

153
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:17,551
Then back over here we'll ride the hog-monkeys.

154
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:21,741
They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!

Earth

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000

00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Air

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Long ago, the four nations...

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
...lived together in harmony.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Then, everthing changed when the Fire Nation attacked.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
But when the world needed him most...

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
...he vanished!

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
A hundred years passed, and my brother and I...

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
...discovered the new Avatar,...

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
...an airbender named Aang.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And although his airbending skills are great...

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
...he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But I believe Aang can save the world.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Book One: Water
Chapter Three: The Southern Air Temple

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Wait 'til you see it, Katara.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Air Temple is one of the most beautiful places in the world.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Aang, I know you're excited, but...

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
...it's been a hundred years since you've been home.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's why I'm so excited!

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
It's just that a lot can change in all that time.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I know, but I need to see it for myself.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Wake up, Sokka!

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Air Temple here we come!

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Sleep now... temple later...

28
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Sokka! Wake up! 
There's a prickle snake in your sleeping bag!

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Aaahhh! Get it off! Get it off! Aaahhh! 

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Great! You're awake. Let's go.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Uncle, I want the repairs made as quickly as possible.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't want to stay too long and risk losing his trail.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You mean the Avatar?

34
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't mention his name on these docks!

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Once word gets out that he's alive every 
firebender will be out looking for him...

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
...and I don't want anyone getting in the way.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Getting in the way of what...

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Prínce Zuko?

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Capitain Zhao.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
It's Commander now...

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
...And General Iroh...

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
...great hero of our nation.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Retired General.

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The Fire Lord's brother and son are welcome guests any time.

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What brings you to my harbor?

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Our ship is being repaired. 

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
That's quite a bit of damage.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Yes... you wouldn't believe what happened.

49
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Uncle! Tell Commander Zhao what happened.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, I will do that.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It was incredible...

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What... did we crash or something?

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Uh, yes! Right into an Earth Kingdom ship.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Really? You must regale me with all the thrilling details.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Join me for a drink?

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Sorry, but we have to go.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Prince Zuko, show Commander Zhao your respect.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
We would be honored to join you.

59
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Do you have any ginseng tea?

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
...It's my favorite.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hey, stomach, be quiet, all right?

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm trying to find us some food. 

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hey! Who ate all my blubbered seal jerky?

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Oh, that was food?

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I used it to start the campfire last night.

66
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Sorry.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You WHAT???

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Awww, no wonder the flames smelled so good.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The Batola mountain range! We're almost there!

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Aang? Before we get to the temple...

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I want to talk to you about the airbenders.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What about'em?

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The Fire Nation is ruthless.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
They killed my mother...

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
...and they could have done the same to your people.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Just because no one has seen an airbender...

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
...doesn't mean the Fire Nation killed them all.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
They probably escaped.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I know it's hard to accept.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You don't understand, Katara.

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The only way to get to an airbender temple is on a flying bison...

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
...and I doubt the Fire Nation has any flying bison.

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Right, Appa?

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There it is... the Southern Air Temple.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Aang, it's amazing!

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We're home, buddy. We're home.

88
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
And by year's end, the Earth Kingdom capital 
will be under our rule. 

89
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The Fire Lord will finally claim victory in this war.

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If my father thinks the rest of the world
will follow him willingly...

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
...then he is a fool. 

92
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Two years at sea have done little
to temper your tongue.

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
So...

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
...how is your search for the Avatar going?

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
My fault entirely.

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We haven't found him yet.

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Did you really expect to?

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The Avatar died a hundred years ago...

99
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
...along with the rest of the airbenders. 

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Unless you found some evidence...

101
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
...that the Avatar is alive.

102
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,300
No. Nothing.

103
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,000
Prínce Zuko...

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
...the Avatar is the only one who can stop...

105
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
the Fire Nation from winning this war.

106
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If you have an ounce of loyalty left...

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
...you'll tell me what you've found.

108
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,000
I haven't found anything.

109
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
It's like you said.

110
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The Avatar probably died a long time ago.

111
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,000
Come on, Uncle, we're going.

112
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,300
Commander Zhao...

113
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,000
...we interrogated the crew as you instructed.

114
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
They confirmed Prince Zuko had the Avatar in custody...

115
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
...but let him escape.

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now, remind me...

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
...how exactly was your ship damaged? 

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So where do I get something to eat? 

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
You're lucky enough to be one of the first 
outsiders to ever visit an airbender temple...

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
...and all you can think about is food?

121
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm just a simple guy with simple needs.

122
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So that's where my friends and I would play airball!

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
And... over there would be where the bison would sleep...

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
...and...

125
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
What's wrong?

126
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This place used to be full of 
monks and lemurs and bison.

127
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Now there's just a bunch of weeds. 

128
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I can't believe how much things have changed.

129
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So, uh, this airball game?

130
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
How do you play? 

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Hahaha! Aang 7, Sokka 0!

132
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Making him feel better is putting me in a world of hurt.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Katara, check this out.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,300
Fire Nation.

135
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,000
We should tell him.

136
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,000
Aang, there's something you need to see.

137
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,600
Okay.

138
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:31,501
What is it?

139
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,000
Uh... just a new waterbending move I learned.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Nice one. But enough practicing.

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We have a whole temple to see! 

142
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You know, you can't protect him forever.

143
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,000
Katara, firebenders were here.

144
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,900
You can't pretend they weren't.

145
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I can for Aang's sake. 

146
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home...

147
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,700
...he'll be devastated.

148
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,000
Hey guys! I want you to meet somebody.

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who's that?

150
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Monk Gyatso...

151
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
...the greatest airbender in the world.

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He taught me everything I know. 

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,700
But the true secret... is in the gooey center!

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,200
Hmmm...
My ancient cake making technique...

155
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:24,001
...isn't the only thing on your mind, is it, Aang?

156
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,000
This whole Avatar thing...

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
...maybe the monks made a mistake.

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The only mistake they made was telling you...

159
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
...before you turned sixteen.

160
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
But we can't concern ourselves with what was.

161
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
We must act on what is.

162
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But Gyatso...

163
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,500
...how do I know if I'm ready for this?

164
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,000
Your questions will be answered...

165
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
...when you are old enough to enter the Air Temple sanctuary.

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,500
Inside you will meet someone...

167
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,000
...who will guide you on your journey.

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Who is it?

169
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,800
When you are ready he will reveal himself to you.

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Now...

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
...are you going to help me with these cakes, or not?

172
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
All right.

173
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:16,001
One... two... three!

174
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Your aim has improved greatly my young pupil.

175
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You must miss him.

176
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yeah.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,500
Where are you going?

178
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,500
The Air Temple Sanctuary.

179
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,500
There's someone I'm ready to meet. 

180
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,000
But Aang...

181
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
...no one could have survived
in there for a hundred years.

182
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's not impossible...

183
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I survived in the iceberg for that long.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Good point.

185
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Katara, whoever's in there might 
help me figure out this Avatar thing!

186
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
And whoever's in there might have 
a medley of delicious, cured meats!

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't suppose you have a key?

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The key, Sokka...

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,500
...is airbending.

190
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hello?

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Anyone home?

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,600
So, a twelve-year-old boy bested 
you and your firebenders?

193
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
You're more pathetic than I thought.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,700
I underestimated him once, 
but it will not happen again.

195
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,000
No, it will not...

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
...because you won't have a second chance.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Commander Zhao, I've been hunting 
the Avatar for two years and I...

198
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
And you failed!

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Capturing the Avatar is too important...

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
...to leave in a teenager's hands.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He's mine now.

202
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,000
Keep them here.

203
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
More tea please?

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Statues?

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's it?

206
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,500
Where's the meat?

207
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,000
Who are all these people?

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I'm not sure...

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
...but it feels like I know them somehow.

210
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Look! That one's an airbender!

211
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
And this one's a waterbender.

212
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
They're lined up in a pattern.

213
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Air, water...

214
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
...earth and fire.

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,500
That's the avatar cycle.

216
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Of course!

217
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,000
They're Avatars.

218
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
All these people are your past lives, Aang.

219
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Wow! There's so many!

220
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,000
Past lives?

221
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,100
Katara, you really believe in that stuff?

222
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,000
It's true.

223
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,800
When the Avatar dies...

224
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,000
...he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.

225
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Aang, snap out of it!

226
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,500
Who is that?

227
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,000
That's Avatar Roku, the Avatar before me.

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,600
You were a firebender?

229
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,800
No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met.

230
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,000
There's no writing.

231
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
How do you know his name?

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm not sure...

233
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,600
...I just know it somehow.

234
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,500
You just couldn't get any weirder!

235
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Firebender.

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Nobody make a sound.

237
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You're making a sound!
Shhhh!

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
That firebender won't know what hit 'em.

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Lemur!

240
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Dinner......

241
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Don't listen to him! 
You're going to be my new pet.

242
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Not if I get him first!

243
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,000
Wait! Come back!

244
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I wanna eat you!

245
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,000
Hey! No Fair!

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
My search party is ready. 

247
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Once I'm out to sea, my guards 
will escort you back to your ship...

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
...and you'll be free to go.

249
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Why?

250
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Are you worried I'm going to try and stop you?

251
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You? Stop me?

252
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Impossible.

253
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't underestimate me, Zhao.

254
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I will capture the Avatar before you. 

255
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Prince Zuko...

256
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,400
That's enough!

257
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,000
You can't compete with me.

258
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I have hundreds of warships under my command...

259
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
...and you...

260
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
you're just a banished prince.

261
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No home. No allies.

262
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,600
Your own father doesn't even want you.

263
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,000
You're wrong.

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Once I deliver the Avatar to my father...

265
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
...he will welcome me home with honor...

266
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
...and restore my rightful place on the throne.

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If your father really wanted you home...

268
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
...he'd have let you return by now...

269
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Avatar or no Avatar.

270
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
But in his eyes you are a failure...

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
...and a disgrace to the Fire Nation.

272
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
That's not true.

273
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You have the scar to prove it.

274
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Maybe you'd like one to match!

275
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Is that a challenge?

276
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,500
An "agni kai".

277
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,000
At sunset.

278
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,000
Very well.

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
It's a shame your father won't be here...

280
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
...to watch me humiliate you.

281
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I guess your uncle will do.

282
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Prince Zuko...

283
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
...have you forgotten what happened last time...

284
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,100
...you dueled a master?

285
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,000
I will never forget. 

286
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Hey! Come back! 

287
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,000
Come on out, little lemur.

288
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
That hungry guy won't bother you anymore.

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Firebenders?

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
They were here?

291
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Gyatso!

292
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,000
Hey Aang, you find my dinner yet? 

293
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,000
Aang, I wasn't really going to eat the lemur, okay?

294
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,500
Oh, man...

295
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,000
Come on, Aang, everything will be all right.

296
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's get out of here.

297
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Send word to the Fire Lord...

298
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
...immediately.

299
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
The Avatar has returned!

300
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,000
Aang! Come on...

301
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
...snap out of it!

302
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
What happened?

303
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
He found out firebenders killed Gyatso.

304
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh no, it's his avatar spirit!

305
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
He must have triggered it!

306
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm gonna try and calm him down.

307
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Well, do it...

308
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
...before he blows us off the mountain!

309
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Remember your firebending basics, Prince Zuko.

310
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
They are your greatest weapons.

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I refuse to let him win. 

312
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,000
This will be over quickly. 

313
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Basics, Zuko!

314
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Break his root!

315
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Do it!

316
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,000
That's it?

317
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Your father raised a coward.

318
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,400
Next time you get in my way, I promise...

319
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:34,000
I won't hold back.

320
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
No, Prince Zuko...

321
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Do not taint your victory. 

322
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So this is how the great Commander Zhao...

323
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,500
...acts in defeat?

324
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,500
Disgraceful. 

325
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,000
Even in exile...

326
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
...my nephew is more honorable than you.

327
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,500
Thanks again for the tea.

328
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,000
It was delicious.

329
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Did you really mean that, Uncle?

330
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,300
Of course.

331
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,200
I told you ginseng tea is my favorite.

332
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,500
Aang, I know you're upset... 

333
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,700
...and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love.

334
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,000
I went through the same thing when I lost my mom.

335
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders...

336
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
...may be gone...

337
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
...but you still have a family.

338
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Sokka and I...

339
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
...we're your family now.

340
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you.

341
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Promise.

342
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
It's okay.

344
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
It wasn't your fault.

345
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
But you were right.

346
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
And if firebenders found this temple...

347
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
...that means they found the other ones, too.

348
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I really am the last airbender. 

349
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Everything's packed.

350
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,500
You ready to go?

351
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,000
How is Roku supposed to help me if I can't talk to him?

352
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Maybe you'll find a way.

353
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Looks like you made a new friend, Sokka.

354
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Can't talk. Must eat.

355
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Hey little guy.

356
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You, me, and Appa. 

357
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We're all that's left of this place.

358
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
We have to stick together.

359
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Katara, Sokka...

360
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
...say hello to the newest member of our family.

361
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What are you going to name him?

362
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Momo.

15
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:30,150
The only reason you should be interrupting me is if you have news about the Avatar.

16
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:35,827
Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might not like it. Don't get too upset.

17
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:39,875
Uncle, you taught me that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader.

18
00:01:39,876 --> 00:01:42,714
Now whatever you have to say, I'm sure that I can take it.

19
00:01:42,715 --> 00:01:46,749
Okay, then... we have no idea where he is.

20
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:48,161
What?!

21
00:01:49,004 --> 00:01:51,349
You really should open a window in here.

22
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,457
Give me the map!

23
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:55,873
Ah, There have been multiple sightings of the Avatar,...

24
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:59,073
...but he is impossible to track down.

25
00:01:59,074 --> 00:02:00,547
How am I gonna find him, Uncle?

26
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:05,319
He is clearly a master of evasive maneuvering.

27
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,153
You have no idea where you're going, do you?

28
00:02:08,154 --> 00:02:10,697
Weeelll, I know it's near water...

29
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,462
I guess we're getting close then.

30
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:18,302
Momo, marbles please.

31
00:02:19,595 --> 00:02:23,928
Hey Katara! Check out this airbending trick!

32
00:02:25,909 --> 00:02:27,306
That's great, Aang.

33
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:29,838
You didn't even look.

34
00:02:29,839 --> 00:02:31,122
That's great!

35
00:02:31,123 --> 00:02:32,670
But I'm not doing it now.

36
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:36,384
Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing.

37
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:40,012
What does me being a girl have to do with sewing?

38
00:02:40,013 --> 00:02:42,579
Simple, girls are better at fixing pants than guys,...

39
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,215
...and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that.

40
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:46,724
It's just the natural order of things.

41
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:51,728
All done with your pants! And look what a great job I did!

42
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:56,650
Wait! I was just kidding! I can't wear these! Katara, please!

43
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:01,057
Relax, Sokka. Where we're going, you won't need any pants!

44
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:07,590
We just made a pit stop yesterday.

45
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:10,477
Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?

46
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:13,909
He's right. At this rate we won't get to the North Pole until spring.

47
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:22,194
But Appa's tired already, aren't you boy? I said, aren't you boy?

48
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:28,914
Yeah, that was real convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten ton magical monster.

49
00:03:28,915 --> 00:03:30,759
Look!

50
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,607
That's why we're here...

51
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:40,548
...elephant koi. And I'm going to ride it. Katara, you've gotta watch me!

52
00:03:43,105 --> 00:03:45,204
Cold!

53
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:10,855
He looks pretty good out there.

54
00:04:10,856 --> 00:04:13,959
Are you kidding? The fish is doing all the work.

55
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,453
No, Appa! Don't eat that!

56
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,613
Aww, man...

57
00:04:28,254 --> 00:04:29,751
There's something in the water!

58
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:35,459
What's wrong?

59
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,260
Aang's in trouble. Aang!

60
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:39,366
Get out of there!

61
00:04:39,769 --> 00:04:42,665
- Come back here! Aang!
- Aang

62
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:06,757
What was that thing?

63
00:05:06,758 --> 00:05:07,928
I don't know.

64
00:05:07,929 --> 00:05:12,263
Well, let's not stick around and find out. Time to hit the road.

65
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:25,926
Or we could stay a while...

66
00:05:29,307 --> 00:05:32,560
You three have some explaining to do.

67
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:34,691
And if you don't answer all our questions,...

68
00:05:34,692 --> 00:05:37,113
...we're throwing you back in the water with the unagi.

69
00:05:37,114 --> 00:05:40,389
Show yourselves, cowards!

70
00:05:42,076 --> 00:05:44,491
Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?

71
00:05:44,492 --> 00:05:46,857
There were no men. We ambushed you.

72
00:05:46,858 --> 00:05:49,619
Now tell us, who are you and what are you doing here?

73
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:52,796
Wait a second, there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down.

74
00:05:52,797 --> 00:05:57,137
A bunch of girls, huh? The unagi's gonna eat well tonight.

75
00:05:57,138 --> 00:06:02,256
No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes.

76
00:06:02,257 --> 00:06:07,006
It's my fault. I'm sorry we came here. I wanted to ride the elephant koi.

77
00:06:07,007 --> 00:06:10,418
How do we know you're not Fire Nation spies?

78
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:15,149
Kyoshi stayed out of the war so far. And we intend to keep it that way!

79
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:18,803
This island is named for Kyoshi? I know Kyoshi!

80
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:21,907
Ha! How could you possibly know her?

81
00:06:21,908 --> 00:06:29,338
Avatar Kyoshi was born here four hundred years ago. She's been dead for centuries.

82
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:31,914
I know her because I'm the Avatar.

83
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:33,239
That's impossible!

84
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,888
The last Avatar was an airbender who disappeared a hundred years ago.

85
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:37,945
That's me!

86
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:41,711
Throw the imposter to the unagi!

87
00:06:43,547 --> 00:06:47,095
Aang... do some airbending...

88
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:56,772
It's true... you are the Avatar!

89
00:06:56,773 --> 00:07:00,390
Now... check this out!

90
00:07:07,514 --> 00:07:11,314
Did you hear the news? The Avatar's on Kyoshi!

91
00:07:11,315 --> 00:07:13,600
Huh?

92
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:23,074
The Avatar's on Kyoshi Island?

93
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:27,190
Uncle, ready the rhinos. He's not getting away from me this time.

94
00:07:27,191 --> 00:07:29,193
Are you going to finish that?

95
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:32,303
I was going to save it for later!

96
00:07:49,326 --> 00:07:55,542
All right! Dessert for breakfast! These people sure know how to treat an Avatar!

97
00:07:55,543 --> 00:07:57,921
Mmm... Katara you've got to try these!

98
00:07:57,922 --> 00:08:00,316
Well, maybe just a bite...

99
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:04,975
Sokka, what's your problem? Eat!

100
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:06,000
Not hungry.

101
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:07,917
But you're always hungry!

102
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,653
He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday.

103
00:08:11,654 --> 00:08:13,129
They snuck up on me!

104
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,710
Right. And then they kicked your butt.

105
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:17,529
Sneak attacks don't count!

106
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:23,099
Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two. I'm not scared of any girls.

107
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,615
Who do they think they are anyway? Mmm... this is tasty.

108
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:32,696
What's he so angry about? It's great here. They're giving us the royal treatment.

109
00:08:32,697 --> 00:08:37,108
Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long.

110
00:08:37,109 --> 00:08:41,335
I'm sure we'll be fine. Besides, did you see how happy I'm making this town?

111
00:08:41,336 --> 00:08:43,434
They're even cleaning up that statue in my honor!

112
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:46,816
Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar.

113
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,801
I just hope it doesn't all go to your head.

114
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:54,224
Come on, you know me better than that. I'm just a simple monk.

115
00:09:19,555 --> 00:09:22,909
Painting the Avatar... that's easy enough...

116
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,776
Oh... there's another one... I'll make an adjustment here, and...

117
00:09:27,777 --> 00:09:30,769
There's more... what...

118
00:10:01,055 --> 00:10:03,684
Sorry ladies! Didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson.

119
00:10:03,685 --> 00:10:06,353
I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?

120
00:10:06,354 --> 00:10:09,166
Well, you're in the right place.

121
00:10:09,167 --> 00:10:13,044
Sorry about yesterday. I didn't know that you were friends with the Avatar.

122
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,863
It's all right. I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge,...

123
00:10:15,864 --> 00:10:18,816
...but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception.

124
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:24,808
I should hope so. A big strong man like you? We wouldn't stand a chance.

125
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:28,683
True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village.

126
00:10:28,684 --> 00:10:32,470
Wow! Best warrior, huh? In your whole village?

127
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:36,466
Maybe you'd be kind enough to give us a little demonstration.

128
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:38,569
Oh... well... I mean... I...

129
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,879
Come on, girls! Wouldn't you like him to show us some moves?

130
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:49,289
Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to. All right, you stand over there. Now.

131
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,991
This may be a little tough, but try to block me.

132
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:59,003
Heh heh... good. Of course, I was going easy on you.

133
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:00,082
Of course.

134
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:02,947
Let's see if you can handle this!

135
00:11:04,752 --> 00:11:06,879
That does it!

136
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:21,946
Anything else you want to teach us?

137
00:11:25,978 --> 00:11:29,858
There she is, girls. Me in a past life.

138
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:34,156
You were pretty!

139
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:37,562
Excuse me for a second, ladies.

140
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:43,069
Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room? It's a little heavy.

141
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,810
Actually, I can't right now.

142
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:46,003
What do you mean you can't?

143
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:48,440
I promised the girls that I'd give them a ride on Appa.

144
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:50,613
Why don't you come with us? It'll be fun!

145
00:11:50,614 --> 00:11:54,209
Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does not sound like fun.

146
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,720
Well, neither does carrying your basket.

147
00:11:56,721 --> 00:12:00,238
It's not my basket. These supplies are for our trip.

148
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:02,224
I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon.

149
00:12:02,225 --> 00:12:04,280
I don't want to leave Kyoshi yet.

150
00:12:04,281 --> 00:12:09,552
I can't put my finger on it, but there's something I really like about this place.

151
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:12,911
What's taking you so long, Aangy?

152
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:13,771
Aangy...

153
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:15,583
Just a second, Koko!

154
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,098
"Simple monk," huh?

155
00:12:17,099 --> 00:12:20,451
I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head.

156
00:12:20,452 --> 00:12:22,887
It didn't. You know what I think?

157
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:25,122
You just don't want to come because you're jealous.

158
00:12:25,123 --> 00:12:27,180
Jealous? Of what?

159
00:12:27,181 --> 00:12:29,314
Jealous that we're having so much fun without you.

160
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:30,462
That's ridiculous.

161
00:12:30,463 --> 00:12:34,736
It is a little ridiculous, but I understand.

162
00:12:45,112 --> 00:12:47,785
Uh... hey, Suki.

163
00:12:47,786 --> 00:12:49,776
Hoping for another dance lesson?

164
00:12:49,777 --> 00:12:52,478
No... I... well, let me explain.

165
00:12:52,479 --> 00:12:56,175
Spit it out! What do you want?

166
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,295
I would be honored if you would teach me.

167
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:01,906
Even if I'm a girl?

168
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:05,291
I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was wrong.

169
00:13:05,292 --> 00:13:09,256
We normally don't teach outsiders, let alone boys.

170
00:13:09,257 --> 00:13:12,032
Please make an exception. I won't let you down.

171
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:15,820
All right. But you have to follow all of our traditions.

172
00:13:15,821 --> 00:13:16,933
Of course!

173
00:13:16,934 --> 00:13:20,442
And I mean all of them.

174
00:13:20,443 --> 00:13:24,296
Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little... girly.

175
00:13:24,297 --> 00:13:27,236
It's a warrior's uniform. You should be proud.

176
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:31,266
The silk threads symbolizes the brave blood that flows through our veins.

177
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:36,110
The gold insignia represents the honor of the warrior's heart.

178
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:38,186
Bravery and honor.

179
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:41,917
Hey Sokka! Nice dress!

180
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:54,643
Katara, remember how the unagi almost got me yesterday?

181
00:13:54,644 --> 00:13:55,489
Yeah.

182
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,284
Well, I'm gonna go ride it now. It's gonna be real dangerous.

183
00:13:59,285 --> 00:14:00,377
Good for you.

184
00:14:00,378 --> 00:14:01,590
You're not going to stop me?

185
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:02,754
Nope. Have fun.

186
00:14:02,755 --> 00:14:03,744
I will.

187
00:14:03,745 --> 00:14:04,302
Great.

188
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,177
I know it's great.

189
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,145
I'm glad you know.

190
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,033
I'm glad you're glad.

191
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:09,501
- Good! - Fine!

192
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,739
You're not going to master it in one day. Even I'm not that good.

193
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,580
I think I'm starting to get it.

194
00:14:30,861 --> 00:14:33,631
It's not about strength.

195
00:14:33,632 --> 00:14:38,229
Our technique is about using your opponents' force against them. Loosen up.

196
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,397
Think of the fan as an extension of your arm.

197
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:44,576
Wait for an opening and then...

198
00:14:48,224 --> 00:14:50,821
I fell on purpose to make you feel better!

199
00:14:50,822 --> 00:14:54,676
I got you! Admit I got you!

200
00:14:54,677 --> 00:15:00,643
Okay, it was a lucky shot. Let's see if you can do it again.

201
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:07,631
What's taking so long?

202
00:15:07,632 --> 00:15:11,556
I'm sure it will be here any second!

203
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:14,356
Um... What about this?

204
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:17,123
Not that again. Boring.

205
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,181
Where's the unagi? It's getting late.

206
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:22,794
Where're you going? Don't leave!

207
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:27,092
Sorry, Aang! Maybe next time.

208
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,148
Katara! You show up!

209
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:35,644
I wanted to make sure you were safe. You really had me worried.

210
00:15:35,645 --> 00:15:38,199
Back there you acted like you didn't care.

211
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,346
I'm sorry.

212
00:15:39,347 --> 00:15:44,504
Me too. I did let all that attention go to my head. I was being a jerk.

213
00:15:44,505 --> 00:15:49,060
Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!

214
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,415
On my way!

215
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,656
Hang on, Aang!

216
00:16:57,025 --> 00:16:58,930
Aang...!

217
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:27,764
Zuko!

218
00:17:41,064 --> 00:17:43,858
I want the Avatar alive.

219
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:01,399
Wake up, Aang!

220
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:11,360
Katara...

221
00:18:11,361 --> 00:18:17,061
...don't ride the unagi. Not fun.

222
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:23,662
Not bad.

223
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:28,768
Firebenders have landed on our shores! Girls, come quickly!

224
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:33,010
Hey, I'm not a... oh, whatever!

225
00:18:38,301 --> 00:18:42,588
Come out, Avatar! You can't hide from me forever!

226
00:18:46,718 --> 00:18:48,498
Find him.

227
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:27,575
I guess training's over.

228
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,509
Nice try, Avatar! But these little girls can't save you.

229
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:46,757
Hey! Over here!

230
00:19:46,758 --> 00:19:48,865
Finally!

231
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:30,165
Get inside.

232
00:20:33,196 --> 00:20:35,054
Look what I brought to this place.

233
00:20:35,055 --> 00:20:36,330
It's not your fault.

234
00:20:36,331 --> 00:20:40,518
Yes, it is. These people got their town destroyed trying to protect me.

235
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,918
Then let's get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us.

236
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,867
I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way.

237
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:50,622
I'll call Appa.

238
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:57,967
There's no time to say goodbye.

239
00:20:57,968 --> 00:20:59,684
What about, "I'm sorry"?

240
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:00,548
For what?

241
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:03,774
I treated you like a girl when I should have treated you like a warrior.

242
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:10,662
I am a warrior. But I'm a girl, too.

243
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:14,962
Now get out of here! We'll hold them off.

244
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:20,227
Appa, yip yip!

245
00:21:21,693 --> 00:21:26,034
Back to the ship! Don't lose sight of them!

246
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:30,925
I know it's hard, but you did the right thing.

247
00:21:30,926 --> 00:21:33,796
Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed.

248
00:21:33,797 --> 00:21:36,763
They're going to be okay, Aang.

249
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:40,635
What are you doing?!

250
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:20,150
Thank you, Avatar.

251
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:23,827
I know, I know. That was stupid and dangerous.

252
00:22:23,828 --> 00:22:26,990
Yes, it was.

Book One: Water
Chapter Five: The King of Omashu

15
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:59,927
The Earth Kingdom city of Omashu!

16
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,134
I used to always come here to visit my friend, Bumi.

17
00:01:04,135 --> 00:01:07,935
Wow. We don't have cities like this in the South Pole.

18
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:10,229
They have buildings here that don't melt!

19
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:14,996
Well, let's go slow pokes! The real fun is inside the city!

20
00:01:14,997 --> 00:01:19,189
Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar.

21
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,546
You need a disguise.

22
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:25,269
So, what am I supposed to do? Grow a mustache?

23
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:32,277
Ohh, so itchy! How do you live in this stuff?

24
00:01:32,912 --> 00:01:35,400
Great! Now you look just like my grandfather.

25
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:39,510
Technically, Aang is 112 years old.

26
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:45,052
Now let's get to skippin', young whippersnappers! The big city awaits.

27
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:04,603
You guys are gonna love Omashu. The people here are the friendliest in the world.

28
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:10,227
Rotten cabbages! What kind of slum do you think this is?

29
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:17,787
Noo! My cabbages!

30
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:22,761
Just keep smiling...

31
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,273
State your business!

32
00:02:30,274 --> 00:02:34,329
My business is my business, young man, and none of yours!

33
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,910
I've got half a mind to bend you over my knee and paddle your backside!

34
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:41,435
Settle down, old timer. Just tell me who you are.

35
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:48,194
Name's Bonzu Pipinpadaloxicopolis, the Third, and these are my grandkids.

36
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:53,067
Hi, June Pipinpadaloxicopolis. Nice to meet you.

37
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:55,642
You seem like a responsible young lady.

38
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:59,456
See that your grandfather stays out of trouble. Enjoy Omashu!

39
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:01,293
We will.

40
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:06,380
Wait a minute!

41
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:10,020
You're a strong young boy.

42
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:14,148
Show some respect for the elderly and carry your grandfather's bag.

43
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:15,743
Good idea!

44
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:50,461
This is the Omashu delivery system. Miles and miles of tubes and chutes.

45
00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:56,204
Earthbending brings the packages up and gravity brings them down.

46
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:58,423
Great, so they get their mail on time.

47
00:03:58,424 --> 00:04:00,180
They do get their mail on time,...

48
00:04:00,181 --> 00:04:05,055
...but my friend Bumi found a better use for these chutes...

49
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:09,868
Look around you, what do you see?

50
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:12,313
Umm... the mail system?

51
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:14,363
Instead of seeing what they want you to see,...

52
00:04:14,364 --> 00:04:17,533
...you gotta open your brain to the possibilities.

53
00:04:17,534 --> 00:04:19,898
A package sending system?

54
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:23,066
The world's greatest super slide!

55
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:27,221
Bumi, you're a mad genius!

56
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:42,344
One ride, then we're off to the North Pole, Airbender's honor.

57
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:45,347
This sounded like fun at first, but now that I'm here,...

58
00:04:45,348 --> 00:04:49,332
...I'm starting to have second thoughts!

59
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:13,578
I'm on it!

60
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:21,116
Men, you'll be going off to combat soon.

61
00:05:21,117 --> 00:05:25,197
It's important that you be prepared for anything.

62
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:36,307
Aang, do something! Use your airbending!

63
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:41,155
Yeh! Good idea! That'll make us go even faster!

64
00:06:15,841 --> 00:06:17,580
Sorry!

65
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:38,159
My cabbages! You're gonna pay for this!

66
00:06:38,912 --> 00:06:41,835
Two cabbages please.

67
00:06:55,167 --> 00:06:58,594
Your majesty, these juveniles were arrested for vandalism,...

68
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:01,769
...traveling under false pretenses and malicious destruction of cabbages.

69
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:04,997
Off with their heads! One for each head of cabbage!

70
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:12,540
Silence! Only the King can pass down judgment. What is your judgment, Sire?

71
00:07:22,993 --> 00:07:27,400
Throw them... a feast!

72
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:29,825
Huh?

73
00:07:37,938 --> 00:07:42,689
The people in my city have gotten fat from too many feasts,...

74
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,241
...so I hope you like your chicken with no skin.

75
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:48,022
Thanks, but I don't eat meat.

76
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:52,567
How about you? I bet you like meat.

77
00:07:53,778 --> 00:07:58,576
Is it just me, or is this guy's crown a little crooked?

78
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:03,569
So, tell me young bald one. Where are you from?

79
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,190
I'm from... Kangaroo Island.

80
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:13,742
Oh, Kangaroo Island, eh? I hear that place is really hoppin!

81
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:21,947
What? It was pretty funny.

82
00:08:22,222 --> 00:08:29,952
Well, all these good jokes are making me tired. Guess it's time to the hay.

83
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:41,934
There's an airbender in our presence and not just any airbender, the Avatar!

84
00:08:42,332 --> 00:08:48,590
Now what do you have to say for yourself, Mr. Pipinpadaloxicopolis?

85
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:59,822
Okay! You caught me. I'm the Avatar, doing my Avatar thing, keeping the world safe.

86
00:08:59,823 --> 00:09:04,933
Everything checks out, no firebenders here. So, good work everybody.

87
00:09:04,934 --> 00:09:08,914
Love each other, respect all life and don't run with your spears.

88
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,899
We'll see you next time!

89
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:16,676
You can't keep us here. Let us leave.

90
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:19,073
Lettuce leaf?

91
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,988
We're in serious trouble. This guy is nuts.

92
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:29,309
Tomorrow the Avatar will face three deadly challenges.

93
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,912
But for now, the guards will show you to your chamber.

94
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:35,727
My liege, do you mean the good chamber, or the bad chamber?

95
00:09:35,728 --> 00:09:37,996
The newly refurbished chamber.

96
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:40,203
Wait, which one are we talking about?

97
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:45,218
The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing that is.

98
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:49,204
Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them.

99
00:09:49,205 --> 00:09:55,544
Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!

100
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:05,648
This is a prison cell? But it's so nice.

101
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:07,824
He did say it was newly refurbished.

102
00:10:07,825 --> 00:10:10,234
Nice or not, we're prisoners.

103
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,607
I wonder what these challenges are gonna be.

104
00:10:12,608 --> 00:10:16,717
We're not sticking around to find out. There's gotta be some way outta here.

105
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:18,780
The air vents!

106
00:10:19,858 --> 00:10:23,409
If you think we're gonna fit through there then you're crazier then that king.

107
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:27,182
We can't, but Momo can.

108
00:10:28,436 --> 00:10:33,057
Momo, I need you to find Appa and bust us outta here!

109
00:10:39,793 --> 00:10:43,328
Go on, boy, get Appa!

110
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:45,931
Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?

111
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:51,177
Appa is a ten ton flying bison, I think he could figure something out.

112
00:10:51,178 --> 00:10:55,762
Well, no point in arguing about it now. Get some rest, Aang.

113
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:59,079
Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow.

114
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:10,280
Sokka! Katara! Where are my friends?

115
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:12,931
The King will free them if you complete your challenges.

116
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:14,730
And if I fail?

117
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:18,463
He didn't say. Your staff please?

118
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:30,894
First, Avatar, what do you think of my new outfit? I want your honest opinion.

119
00:11:32,181 --> 00:11:34,415
I'm waiting.

120
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,737
I... guess it's fine.

121
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,949
Excellent! You passed the first test.

122
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,698
Really?

123
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:47,877
Well, not one of the deadly tests. The real challenges are much more... challenging.

124
00:11:49,576 --> 00:11:54,251
I don't have time for your crazy games! Gimme my friends back! We're leaving!

125
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:57,367
Ohh, I thought you might refuse...

126
00:11:57,368 --> 00:12:01,772
...so I will give your friends some special souvenirs.

127
00:12:01,773 --> 00:12:08,484
Those delightful rings are made of pure genemite, also known as creeping crystal.

128
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:11,607
It's crystal that grows remarkably fast.

129
00:12:11,608 --> 00:12:15,470
By nightfall your friends will be completely covered in it.

130
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:21,779
Terrible fate, really. I can stop it, but only if you cooperate.

131
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,497
Ah! It's already creeping!

132
00:12:24,498 --> 00:12:26,901
I'll do as you want.

133
00:12:37,871 --> 00:12:43,587
It seems I've lost my lunch box key and I'm hungry.

134
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:51,168
Ooo, there it is. Would you mind fetching it for me?

135
00:13:07,456 --> 00:13:13,578
Ooo, climbing the ladder. No one's thought of that before.

136
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:47,066
That's right. Keep diving head in, I'm sure it'll work eventually.

137
00:14:00,792 --> 00:14:05,117
There, enjoy your lunch! I want my friends back, now!

138
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:13,248
Uh, not yet. I need help with another matter. It seems I've lost my pet Flopsy.

139
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:14,862
Okay, found him!

140
00:14:14,863 --> 00:14:18,630
Bring him to me! Daddy wants a kiss from Flopsy!

141
00:14:18,631 --> 00:14:20,972
Come here, Flopsy!

142
00:14:27,751 --> 00:14:30,863
Flopsy, wait! Flopsy!

143
00:14:34,622 --> 00:14:36,225
Flopsy!

144
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:49,597
Wait a minute?

145
00:14:52,205 --> 00:14:54,164
Flopsy?

146
00:14:58,653 --> 00:15:01,116
Flopsy!

147
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:13,528
Awww, that's a good boy! Yes, who has a soft belly?

148
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:16,096
Guys, are you okay?

149
00:15:16,097 --> 00:15:21,752
Other than the crystal slowly encasing my entire body, doing great.

150
00:15:24,336 --> 00:15:26,667
Awww, yes.

151
00:15:26,668 --> 00:15:30,869
Come on. I'm ready for the next challenge.

152
00:15:35,045 --> 00:15:43,561
Your final test is a duel and as a special treat you may choose your opponent.

153
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:53,023
Point and choose.

154
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:58,832
So, you're saying whoever I point to, that's the person I get to fight?

155
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:01,623
Choose wisely.

156
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,757
I... choose...

157
00:16:05,758 --> 00:16:07,498
...you!

158
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:10,807
Wrong choice!

159
00:16:35,151 --> 00:16:38,141
You thought I was a frail old man,...

160
00:16:38,142 --> 00:16:42,387
...but I'm the most powerful earthbender you'll ever see.

161
00:16:42,388 --> 00:16:44,751
Can I fight the guy with the axe instead?

162
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:51,369
There are no... take-back-sees' in my kingdom. You might need this!

163
00:16:56,666 --> 00:17:00,543
Typical airbender tactic, avoid and evade.

164
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:05,110
I'd hoped the Avatar would be less predictable.

165
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:12,821
Don't you have any surprises for me? Sooner or later, you'll have to strike back.

166
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:31,332
Oh, you'll have to be a little more creative than that!

167
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:46,291
Did someone leave the windows open? It feels a little drafty in here!

168
00:17:46,292 --> 00:17:50,192
Are you hoping I'll catch a cold?

169
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:07,856
How are you going to get me from way over there?

170
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:30,571
Hehe! Well done, Avatar. You fight with much fire in your heart.

171
00:19:33,154 --> 00:19:35,161
Huh?

172
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:46,945
You've passed all my tests. Now, you must answer one question.

173
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:50,924
That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your tests.

174
00:19:50,925 --> 00:19:54,712
Oh, but what's the point of tests if you don't learn anything?

175
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:56,480
Oh come on!

176
00:19:56,481 --> 00:20:05,623
Answer this one question and I will set your friends free. What... is my name?

177
00:20:05,624 --> 00:20:10,851
From the looks of your friends, I'd say you only have a few minutes.

178
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:12,640
How am I supposed to know his name?

179
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:15,761
Think about the challenges, maybe it's some kind of riddle.

180
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:16,347
I got it!

181
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:16,825
Yeh?

182
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:22,969
He's an earthbender, right? Rocky! You know, because of all the rocks?

183
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:25,342
We're gonna keep trying, but that is a good backup.

184
00:20:25,343 --> 00:20:29,593
Okay, so back to the challenges. I got a key from the waterfall.

185
00:20:29,594 --> 00:20:32,163
I saved his pet and I had a duel.

186
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:33,539
And what did you learn?

187
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,217
Well, everything was different than I expected.

188
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:39,176
And...?

189
00:20:39,177 --> 00:20:42,231
Well, they weren't straightforward.

190
00:20:42,232 --> 00:20:50,814
To solve each test, I had to think differently than I usually would. I know his name!

191
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,512
I solved the question the same way I solved the challenges.

192
00:20:54,513 --> 00:21:01,074
As you said a long time ago, I had to open my brain to the possibilities.

193
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:06,636
Bumi, you're a mad genius!

194
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:14,721
Oh, Aang. It's good to see you. You haven't changed a bit. Literally.

195
00:21:14,722 --> 00:21:16,364
Uh, over here!

196
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:17,931
Little help?

197
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:25,722
Genemite is made of rock candy. Delicious!

198
00:21:25,723 --> 00:21:29,348
So this crazy king is your old friend, Bumi?

199
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:33,120
Who you calling old? Okay. I'm old.

200
00:21:33,121 --> 00:21:37,106
Why did you do all this instead of just telling Aang who you were?

201
00:21:37,107 --> 00:21:43,411
First of all, it's pretty fun messing with people, hehe, but I do have a reason.

202
00:21:43,412 --> 00:21:46,112
Aang, you have a difficult task ahead.

203
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:49,379
The world has changed in the hundred years you've been gone.

204
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:55,212
It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai.

205
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:56,896
You have much to learn.

206
00:21:56,897 --> 00:22:02,210
You must master the four elements and confront the Fire Lord, and when you do,...

207
00:22:02,211 --> 00:22:05,945
...I hope you will think like a mad genius!

208
00:22:08,311 --> 00:22:11,507
And it looks like you're in good hands.

209
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:16,219
You'll need your friends to help defeat the Fire Nation.

210
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,136
And you'll need Momo too.

211
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:26,108
Thank you for your wisdom. But before we leave, I have a challenge for you!

212
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:34,224
My cabbages!

5
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,496
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water
Chapter Six: Imprisoned

15
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:07,709
Great, you're back! What's for dinner?

16
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,266
We've got a few options.

17
00:01:09,408 --> 00:01:13,249
First, round nuts and some kind of oval shaped nuts,...

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,834
...and some rock shaped nuts that... might just be rocks.

19
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:20,302
Dig in!

20
00:01:21,093 --> 00:01:24,928
Seriously, what else ya got?

21
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:34,402
What was that!?

22
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:41,130
It's coming from over there!

23
00:01:41,265 --> 00:01:46,175
Shouldn't we run away from huge booms... not toward them?

24
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,322
An earthbender!

25
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:58,612
Let's go meet him!

26
00:01:58,716 --> 00:02:01,326
He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously.

27
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:06,527
Hello there, I'm Katara! What's your name?

28
00:02:13,539 --> 00:02:15,242
Nice to meet you!

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,036
We just wanted to say "hi".

30
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,614
Hey, that guy's gotta be running somewhere,...

31
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:23,597
...maybe we're near a village and I bet that village has a market!

32
00:02:23,698 --> 00:02:25,671
Which means no nuts for dinner!

33
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:32,261
Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! Yeh, I hate'em too.

34
00:02:39,423 --> 00:02:44,027
Great hat. I'll trade you some nuts for it.

35
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:47,800
Hey!

36
00:02:48,517 --> 00:02:49,401
Hi, mom.

37
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:53,871
Where have you been, Haru? You're late! Get started on your chores.

38
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:57,805
Hey, you're that kid! Why did you run away before?

39
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,929
Uh, you must have me confused with some other kid.

40
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,723
No she doesn't, we saw you earthbending.

41
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,505
They saw you doing what?

42
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:11,825
They're crazy, mom, I mean, look at how they're dressed!

43
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:14,478
You know how dangerous that is!

44
00:03:14,605 --> 00:03:18,565
You know what would happen if they caught you earthbending!

45
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:19,817
Open up!

46
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:25,775
Fire Nation! Act natural!

47
00:03:35,576 --> 00:03:38,321
What do you want? I've already paid you this week.

48
00:03:38,431 --> 00:03:43,368
The tax just doubled. Wouldn't want an accident, would we?

49
00:03:43,504 --> 00:03:48,913
Fire is sometimes so hard to control.

50
00:03:54,805 --> 00:03:58,684
You can keep the copper ones.

51
00:04:01,323 --> 00:04:04,958
Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here?

52
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:10,584
Five years. Fire Lord Ozai uses our town's coal mines to fuel his ships.

53
00:04:10,731 --> 00:04:12,903
They're thugs, they steal from us,...

54
00:04:13,032 --> 00:04:16,118
...and everyone here is too much of a coward to do anything about it.

55
00:04:16,253 --> 00:04:18,686
Quiet, Haru. Don't talk like that.

56
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,536
But, Haru's an earthbender, he can help.

57
00:04:21,668 --> 00:04:23,524
Earthbending is forbidden.

58
00:04:23,665 --> 00:04:28,509
It's caused nothing but misery for this village. He must never use his abilities.

59
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,996
How can you say that? Haru has a gift.

60
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:35,905
Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend.

61
00:04:36,045 --> 00:04:37,371
It's a part of who we are.

62
00:04:37,489 --> 00:04:39,087
You don't understand.

63
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,135
I understand that Haru can help you fight back.

64
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:45,243
What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already?

65
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:52,519
They could take Haru away! Like they took his father.

66
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:01,788
My mom said you can sleep here tonight, but you should leave in the morning.

67
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:06,861
Thanks. I'll make sure Appa doesn't eat all your hay.

68
00:05:10,698 --> 00:05:14,521
I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father.

69
00:05:14,664 --> 00:05:15,964
That's ok.

70
00:05:16,115 --> 00:05:21,815
It's funny, the way you were talking back in the store, it reminded me of him.

71
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:22,784
Thanks.

72
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,801
My father was very courageous.

73
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,300
When the Fire Nation invaded,...

74
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,092
...he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one,...

75
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,752
...but they fought back anyway.

76
00:05:30,886 --> 00:05:33,431
He sounds like a great man.

77
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,625
After the attack,...

78
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:38,927
...they rounded up my father every other earthbender and took them away.

79
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,805
We haven't seen them since.

80
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:43,254
So, that's why you hide your earthbending?

81
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:49,766
Yeh. The problem is that the only way I can feel close to my father now...

82
00:05:49,885 --> 00:05:56,448
...is when I practice my bending. He taught me everything I know.

83
00:05:56,914 --> 00:06:00,343
See this necklace? My mother gave it to me.

84
00:06:00,463 --> 00:06:01,507
It's beautiful.

85
00:06:01,622 --> 00:06:06,595
I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. This necklace is all I have left of her.

86
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:08,516
It's not enough, is it?

87
00:06:08,643 --> 00:06:10,451
No.

88
00:06:16,096 --> 00:06:16,874
Help!

89
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,440
The mine!

90
00:06:20,544 --> 00:06:22,581
Help me!

91
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:31,280
It's not working, we have to get help.

92
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:34,435
There's no time... pull harder.

93
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:37,348
Haru, there's a way you can help him.

94
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:38,462
I can't.

95
00:06:38,561 --> 00:06:43,115
Please, there's no one around to see you, it's the only way.

96
00:06:54,591 --> 00:06:57,265
Haru, you did it!

97
00:07:04,611 --> 00:07:08,718
It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man.

98
00:07:08,897 --> 00:07:10,882
You must have really inspired him.

99
00:07:11,058 --> 00:07:12,312
I guess so.

100
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:14,305
Everyone should get some sleep. We're leaving at dawn.

101
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:16,839
Dawn? Can't we sleep in for once?

102
00:07:16,947 --> 00:07:20,200
Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops.

103
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:24,993
If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Good night.

104
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,277
I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.

105
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,032
Good night.

106
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:57,280
That's him! That's the earthbender!

107
00:08:23,702 --> 00:08:26,203
They took him! They took Haru away!

108
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:26,990
What?

109
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:28,998
The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation.

110
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:31,086
It's all my fault, I forced him into earthbending.

111
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,837
Slow down, Katara, when did this happen?

112
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,400
Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.

113
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,436
Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone.

114
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:42,698
We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.

115
00:08:42,847 --> 00:08:45,024
...and why would they do that?

116
00:08:45,154 --> 00:08:49,825
Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending.

117
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:54,608
I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work.

118
00:08:54,745 --> 00:08:56,633
There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines,...

119
00:08:56,752 --> 00:09:00,344
...all Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here.

120
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:04,057
The boulder levitates and... tada! Fake earthbending.

121
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,442
Aang. Did you get all that?

122
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:07,844
Sure, I got it.

123
00:09:07,955 --> 00:09:09,468
Do you remember your cue?

124
00:09:09,596 --> 00:09:13,321
Yeh, yeh, just relax. You're taking all the fun out of this.

125
00:09:13,446 --> 00:09:15,970
By "this" do you mean intentionally getting captured...

126
00:09:16,076 --> 00:09:17,985
...by an army of ruthless firebenders?

127
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:20,737
Exactly! That's fun stuff.

128
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:24,722
Here they come! Get in your places!

129
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:28,113
Get out of my way, pipsqueak!

130
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:32,626
How dare you call me "pipsqueak" you giant-eared cretin!

131
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:34,523
What did you call me?

132
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:40,327
A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things. Do herds of animals use them for shade?

133
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:43,711
You better back off! Seriously... back off.

134
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:45,775
I will not back off!

135
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:50,163
I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are!

136
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:52,691
That's it... you're going down!

137
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:58,730
I'll show you who's boss... earthbending style!

138
00:10:00,735 --> 00:10:06,215
I said, "earthbending style!"

139
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:12,730
That lemur! It's earthbending!

140
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:15,259
No, you idiot! It's the girl!

141
00:10:15,437 --> 00:10:18,857
Oh, of course.

142
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:25,952
I'll hold her! You've got 12 hours to find Haru, we'll be right behind you.

143
00:10:32,227 --> 00:10:36,423
Momo, you have some big ears!

144
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:17,928
She'll be fine, Aang, Katara knows what she's doing.

145
00:11:24,032 --> 00:11:30,278
Earthbenders, it is my pleasure to welcome you aboard my modest shipyard.

146
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:32,727
I am your warden.

147
00:11:32,866 --> 00:11:38,512
I prefer to think of you not as prisoners, but as honored guests,...

148
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:44,725
...and I hope you come to think of me as your humble and caring host.

149
00:11:44,834 --> 00:11:49,742
You will succeed here if you simply abide...

150
00:11:53,691 --> 00:11:59,465
What kind of guest dishonors his host by interrupting him!? Take him below!

151
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,981
One week in solitary will improve his manners.

152
00:12:03,134 --> 00:12:10,696
Simply treat me with the courtesy I give you and we'll get along famously.

153
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:16,521
You will notice earthbenders, that this rig is made entirely of metal.

154
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:23,014
You are miles away from any rock or earth, so if you have any illusions about...

155
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:28,869
...employing that brutish savagery that passes for bending among you people,...

156
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:33,945
...forget them. It is impossible.

157
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:37,115
Good day.

158
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:02,203
Katara?

159
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,338
Haru!

160
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:05,202
What are you doing here?

161
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:08,893
It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you.

162
00:13:08,993 --> 00:13:11,104
So, you got yourself arrested?

163
00:13:11,214 --> 00:13:13,000
It was the only way to find you.

164
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:15,747
You got guts, Katara, I'll give you that.

165
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:19,919
Come one, there's someone I want you to meet.

166
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:25,945
Katara, this is my father, Tyro. Dad, this is Katara.

167
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:29,146
It's an honor to meet you.

168
00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:32,531
Have some dinner, Katara.

169
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:36,371
It's not as bad as it looks.

170
00:13:38,848 --> 00:13:41,051
It's still pretty bad though.

171
00:13:41,207 --> 00:13:44,404
Tyro, the prisoners are complaining there aren't enough blankets to go around.

172
00:13:44,537 --> 00:13:49,011
I'll talk to the guards. In the meantime, make sure the elderly are taken care of.

173
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:51,978
The rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather.

174
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:54,853
If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan?

175
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:56,009
Excuse me?

176
00:13:56,127 --> 00:14:00,516
You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? Mutiny? Sabotage?

177
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:05,352
The plan? The plan is to survive... wait out this war.

178
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:09,120
Hope that one day some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened.

179
00:14:09,264 --> 00:14:12,826
How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up.

180
00:14:12,948 --> 00:14:17,983
Katara, I admire your courage and I envy your youth,...

181
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:20,533
...but people's lives are at stake here.

182
00:14:20,689 --> 00:14:25,418
The Warden is a ruthless man, and he won't stand for any rebellion.

183
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:28,972
I'm sorry, but we're powerless.

184
00:14:29,194 --> 00:14:32,135
We'll see about that.

185
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:38,473
Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you.

186
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:42,947
Every child of my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave...

187
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:47,957
...Earth Kingdom and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders.

188
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:51,800
Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless.

189
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:54,877
Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend,...

190
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:59,817
...but they can't take away your courage and it is your courage they should truly fear!

191
00:14:59,915 --> 00:15:03,570
Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig,...

192
00:15:03,663 --> 00:15:06,479
...any ocean that keeps you far from home.

193
00:15:06,601 --> 00:15:09,961
It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are,...

194
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:14,792
...hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away.

195
00:15:14,912 --> 00:15:20,710
The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned!

196
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:27,906
So remember your courage, earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom!

197
00:16:05,258 --> 00:16:09,011
Your 12 hours are up, where's Haru? We've got to get out of here.

198
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,369
I can't.

199
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,244
We don't have much time, there are guards everywhere. Get on.

200
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:16,163
Katara, what's wrong?

201
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,425
I'm not leaving.

202
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:22,211
I'm not giving up on these people.

203
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:27,166
What do you mean you're not leaving!?

204
00:16:27,272 --> 00:16:31,041
We can't abandon these people. There has to be a way to help them.

205
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,959
Maybe she's right. What do you say, Sokka?

206
00:16:34,074 --> 00:16:37,062
I say you're both crazy!

207
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:40,488
Last chance, we need to leave... now!

208
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,836
No.

209
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:47,323
I hate when you get like this. Come on, we better hide.

210
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,834
Look!

211
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:57,867
Tell me exactly what you saw.

212
00:16:57,969 --> 00:16:59,972
Well, Sir, it looked like a flying bison.

213
00:17:00,095 --> 00:17:00,536
What?

214
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,202
It was a giant flying buffalo, Sir, with an empty saddle.

215
00:17:04,224 --> 00:17:07,122
Which was it? A buffalo or a bison?

216
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:12,042
Uh, I'm not sure what the difference is, but that's not really the point is it, Sir?

217
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:16,560
I'll decide what the point is, fool!

218
00:17:18,637 --> 00:17:22,775
You! Wake up the Captain. Search the entire rig!

219
00:17:22,818 --> 00:17:23,568
Sir?

220
00:17:23,614 --> 00:17:24,355
What!?

221
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:27,979
That... was the Captain you just threw overboard, so...

222
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:31,443
Then wake up someone I haven't thrown overboard and search the rig!

223
00:17:31,571 --> 00:17:36,404
There's something going on here and I don't like it.

224
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:44,975
We don't have much time. What are we gonna do?

225
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:48,508
I wish I knew how to make a hurricane.

226
00:17:48,603 --> 00:17:51,276
The Warden would run away and we'd steal his keys!

227
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,473
Wouldn't he just take his keys with him?

228
00:17:53,588 --> 00:17:55,613
I'm just tossing ideas around.

229
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:59,385
I tired talking the earthbenders into fighting back, but it didn't work.

230
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:02,494
If there was just a way to help them help themselves.

231
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:08,064
For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock... something they can bend.

232
00:18:08,205 --> 00:18:12,186
But this entire place is made of metal.

233
00:18:12,914 --> 00:18:21,987
No, it's not. Look at the smoke. I bet they're burning coal... In other words, earth.

234
00:18:24,457 --> 00:18:28,872
It's almost dawn, we're running out of time! Are you sure this is gonna work?

235
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:32,853
It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village.

236
00:18:32,957 --> 00:18:36,184
We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale.

237
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:38,866
There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo,...

238
00:18:38,991 --> 00:18:42,938
...and the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one.

239
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,579
When he does his airbending, the coal only has one place to go... right back here.

240
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,625
There's the intruder!

241
00:18:49,752 --> 00:18:51,551
Stay back, I'm warning you!

242
00:18:51,686 --> 00:18:56,525
Katara stop! You can't win this fight!

243
00:18:56,993 --> 00:19:06,187
Listen to him well, child. You're one mistake away from dying where you stand.

244
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:32,162
Here's your chance, earthbenders! Take it! Your fate is in your own hands!

245
00:19:38,285 --> 00:19:39,939
Foolish girl!

246
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:46,370
You thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people?

247
00:19:46,494 --> 00:19:53,625
Look at these blank, hopeless faces. There spirits were broken a long time ago.

248
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:57,097
Oh? But you still believe in them?

249
00:19:57,228 --> 00:20:08,060
How sweet. They're a waste of your energy, little girl. You've failed.

250
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,299
Show no mercy!

251
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:29,731
For the Earth Kingdom, attack!

252
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:06,364
Get to the ship! We'll hold them off!

253
00:21:06,486 --> 00:21:09,405
Do not let them escape!

254
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:14,548
Guys, throw me some coal!

255
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,679
No, please! I can't swim!

256
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:34,987
Don't worry, I hear cowards float.

257
00:21:44,202 --> 00:21:47,763
I want to thank you for saving me. For saving us.

258
00:21:47,892 --> 00:21:49,940
All it took was a little coal.

259
00:21:50,061 --> 00:21:54,047
It wasn't the coal, Katara, it was you.

260
00:21:54,174 --> 00:21:58,631
Thank you for helping me find my courage, Katara, of the water tribe.

261
00:21:58,761 --> 00:22:03,078
My family and everyone here owes you much.

262
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:05,605
So, I guess you're going home now?

263
00:22:05,744 --> 00:22:10,660
Yes, to take back my village. To take back all of our villages!

264
00:22:10,779 --> 00:22:16,031
The Fire Nation will regret the day they set foot on our land!

265
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:17,294
Come with us.

266
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:23,978
I can't. Your mission is to take back your home. Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole.

267
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:27,646
That's him, isn't it? The Avatar.

268
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:31,962
Katara, thank you for bringing my father back to me.

269
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,318
I never thought I'd see him again. I only wish there was some way...

270
00:22:36,432 --> 00:22:42,044
I know. My mother's necklace! It's gone!

Book One: Water | Chapter Seven:
The Spirit World (Winter Solstice, Part 1)

15
00:01:06,077 --> 00:01:08,542
Those clouds look so soft, don't they?

16
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:13,054
Like you could just jump down and you'd land in a big, soft cottony heap.

17
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:14,731
Maybe you should give it a try.

18
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:16,194
You're hilarious.

19
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,152
I'll try it!

20
00:01:20,739 --> 00:01:23,237
Yehhhh!

21
00:01:27,923 --> 00:01:31,835
Turns out clouds are made of water!

22
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:39,033
Hey, what is that?

23
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:44,807
It's like a scar.

24
00:01:47,389 --> 00:01:52,795
Listen, it's so quiet. There's no life anywhere.

25
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:55,629
Aang, are you okay?

26
00:01:55,756 --> 00:01:59,690
Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for...

27
00:01:59,784 --> 00:02:00,829
Shh!

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,137
What? I'm not allowed to be angry?

29
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:11,888
Why would anyone do this? How could I let this happen?

30
00:02:11,983 --> 00:02:16,082
Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you.

31
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:22,030
Yes it does. It's the Avatar's job to protect nature. But, I don't know how to do my job.

32
00:02:22,138 --> 00:02:25,705
That's why we're going to the North Pole to find you a teacher.

33
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:27,834
Yeh, a waterbending teacher,...

34
00:02:27,946 --> 00:02:30,661
...but there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar.

35
00:02:30,778 --> 00:02:33,615
Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.

36
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,472
The Avatar before you?

37
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:39,147
He died over a hundred years ago, how are you supposed to talk to him?

38
00:02:39,265 --> 00:02:42,146
I don't know.

39
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:50,227
Uncle! It's time to leave! Where are you? Uncle Iroh!

40
00:02:50,352 --> 00:02:51,731
Over here.

41
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:52,936
Uncle?

42
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,723
We need to move on, we're closing in on the Avatar's trail and I don't want to lose him!

43
00:02:58,831 --> 00:03:01,239
You look tired, Prince Zuko.

44
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,394
Why don't you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles.

45
00:03:07,529 --> 00:03:11,217
My troubles cannot be soaked away. It's time to go!

46
00:03:11,354 --> 00:03:16,078
You should take your teacher's advice and relax a little.

47
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:24,551
The temperature's just right. I heated it myself.

48
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:28,131
Enough! We need to leave now! Get out of the water!

49
00:03:28,278 --> 00:03:29,545
Very well.

50
00:03:29,655 --> 00:03:32,655
On second thought, why don't you take another few minutes,...

51
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:36,270
...but be back at the ship in half an hour or I'm leaving without you.

52
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:42,669
Hey Aang, are you ready to be cheered up?

53
00:03:42,778 --> 00:03:44,522
No.

54
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:48,429
Hey, how was that cheering me up?

55
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:50,425
Cheered me up.

56
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:54,605
Ow! Yeh, I probably deserved that.

57
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:59,886
These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back.

58
00:04:00,009 --> 00:04:02,481
Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday,...

59
00:04:02,596 --> 00:04:07,695
...and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back.

60
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,362
Thanks, Katara.

61
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:14,828
Hey, who are you?

62
00:04:14,944 --> 00:04:19,110
When I saw the flying bison, I thought it was impossible,...

63
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:25,958
...but those markings... are you the Avatar child?

64
00:04:26,743 --> 00:04:30,938
My village desperately needs your help.

65
00:04:43,231 --> 00:04:46,925
This young person is the Avatar.

66
00:04:47,047 --> 00:04:50,154
So the rumors of your return are true.

67
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:53,966
It is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence.

68
00:04:54,082 --> 00:04:56,570
Nice to meet you too.

69
00:04:57,224 --> 00:05:00,390
So... is there something I can help you with?

70
00:05:00,513 --> 00:05:02,467
I'm not sure...

71
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,754
Our village is in crisis, he's our only hope.

72
00:05:06,863 --> 00:05:13,085
For the last few days at sunset a spirit monster comes and attacks our village.

73
00:05:13,207 --> 00:05:17,305
He is Hei-Bai, the black and white spirit.

74
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,086
Why is it attacking you?

75
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,423
We do not know, but each of the last three nights he has abducted one of our own.

76
00:05:24,553 --> 00:05:28,263
We are especially fearful because the winter solstice draws near.

77
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:29,744
What happens then?

78
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:34,331
As the solstice approaches, the natural world and the spirit world...

79
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:40,678
...grow closer and closer until the line between them is blurred completely.

80
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:44,144
Hei-Bai is already causing devastation and destruction.

81
00:05:44,272 --> 00:05:48,424
Once the solstice is here there is no telling what will happen.

82
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:51,321
So, what do you want me to do exactly?

83
00:05:51,443 --> 00:05:55,903
Who better to resolve a crisis between our world and the spirit world...

84
00:05:56,015 --> 00:06:02,530
...than the Avatar himself? You are the great bridge between man and spirits.

85
00:06:02,656 --> 00:06:04,898
Right... that's me.

86
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,263
Hey, great bridge guy', can I talk to you over here for a second?

87
00:06:10,383 --> 00:06:13,349
Aang, you seem a little unsure about all this.

88
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,712
Yeh, that might be because I don't know anything at all about the spirit world.

89
00:06:18,853 --> 00:06:21,530
It's not like there's someone to teach me this stuff!

90
00:06:21,665 --> 00:06:23,824
So, can you help these people?

91
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:31,176
I have to try, don't I? Maybe whatever I have to do will just... come to me.

92
00:06:31,272 --> 00:06:34,167
I think you can do it, Aang.

93
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:39,978
Yehhh, we're all gonna get eaten by a spirit monster.

94
00:06:47,915 --> 00:06:49,929
Who's there?

95
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:58,084
A meadow vole! I should have known. You startled me, little one.

96
00:06:58,172 --> 00:07:03,542
Ehh, seems I've dozed off and missed my nephew's deadline,...

97
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:09,313
...but it was a very sweet nap.

98
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:20,822
He's a Fire Nation soldier.

99
00:07:20,911 --> 00:07:26,270
He's no ordinary soldier. This is the Fire Lord's brother, the Dragon of the West,...

100
00:07:26,383 --> 00:07:33,780
...the once great General Iroh, but now, he's our prisoner.

101
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:49,092
Hello? Spirit, can you hear me? This is the Avatar speaking.

102
00:07:49,195 --> 00:07:51,993
I'm... here to try to help stuff.

103
00:07:52,101 --> 00:07:53,176
This isn't right.

104
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:56,964
We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up.

105
00:07:57,085 --> 00:07:59,506
If anyone can save us, he can.

106
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:04,067
He still shouldn't have to face this alone.

107
00:08:08,242 --> 00:08:12,340
The sun has set. Where are you, Hei-Bai?

108
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:20,732
Well, spirit, uh, I hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace!

109
00:08:22,357 --> 00:08:27,848
Okay. Well, I guess that's settled then.

110
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:51,634
You must be the Hei-Bai spirit. My name is...

111
00:08:55,213 --> 00:09:01,939
My name is Aang! I'm the Avatar and I would like to help! Hey, wait up!

112
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:16,975
The Avatar's methods are... unusual.

113
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:20,733
It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him?

114
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,319
No, only the Avatar stands a chance against the Hei-Bai.

115
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:30,088
Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.

116
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:34,886
Please, would you stop destroying things and listen?

117
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:37,591
I'm just trying to do my job as spirit bridge.

118
00:09:37,684 --> 00:09:45,823
Excuse me, would you please turn around? I command you to turn around now!

119
00:09:49,102 --> 00:09:50,832
That's it! He needs help!

120
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:52,927
Sokka wait!

121
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:55,143
It's not safe!

122
00:09:55,348 --> 00:09:58,279
Hei-Bai! Over here!

123
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,641
Sokka, go back!

124
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,478
We'll fight him together, Aang.

125
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:08,667
I don't wanna fight him unless I... huh!

126
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:14,371
Sokka!

127
00:10:20,993 --> 00:10:23,736
Uncle! Uncle, where are you?

128
00:10:23,846 --> 00:10:26,011
Sir, maybe he thought you left without him?

129
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:30,288
Something's not right here. That pile of rocks...

130
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:32,755
It looks like there's been a landslide, Sir.

131
00:10:32,863 --> 00:10:37,806
Land doesn't slide uphill. Those rocks didn't move naturally.

132
00:10:37,917 --> 00:10:41,787
My uncle's been captured by earthbenders!

133
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,235
Aang, over here!

134
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:01,732
Help!

135
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,431
Hang on, Sokka!

136
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,675
Sokka!

137
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,411
I failed.

138
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:42,630
Where are you taking me?

139
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:44,760
We're taking you to face justice.

140
00:11:44,857 --> 00:11:48,280
Right. But where, specifically?

141
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,976
A place you're quite familiar with, actually.

142
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:57,048
You once laid siege to it for 600 days, but it would not yield to you.

143
00:11:57,148 --> 00:12:01,311
Ah! The great city of Ba Sing Se.

144
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:04,082
It was greater than you were, apparently.

145
00:12:04,176 --> 00:12:07,842
I acknowledged my defeat at Ba Sing Se!

146
00:12:07,946 --> 00:12:17,120
After 600 days away from home, my men were tired and I was tired,...

147
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:21,523
...and I'm still tired.

148
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,615
I'm sure they'll be back.

149
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,017
I know.

150
00:12:46,148 --> 00:12:48,534
You should get some rest.

151
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:51,724
Everything's gonna be okay.

152
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:58,612
Your brother is in good hands. I would be shocked if the Avatar returned without him.

153
00:12:58,712 --> 00:13:03,342
Katara, Katara I lost him.

154
00:13:04,463 --> 00:13:09,372
The sun is rising. Perhaps he will return soon.

155
00:13:09,462 --> 00:13:13,266
What? No, I'm right here!

156
00:13:20,434 --> 00:13:23,644
I'm in the spirit world!

157
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:35,463
Yup, that's Uncle Iroh.

158
00:13:37,473 --> 00:13:40,199
I'll figure this out, Katara, I promise.

159
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:43,337
Like they said, I'm the bridge between the worlds, right?

160
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:50,771
All I have to do is... figure out what I have to do. But once I do that, no problem!

161
00:13:50,881 --> 00:13:59,325
Appa! Hey buddy, I'm right here. But, I guess you can't see me either.

162
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:03,112
It's ok, Appa. Dont' worry. I'm sure they're on their way back.

163
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:08,504
I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat.

164
00:14:09,036 --> 00:14:11,575
What am I supposed to do?

165
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,118
Avatar Roku, how can I talk to you?

166
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,848
Sokka?

167
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,634
That's definitely not Sokka!

168
00:14:35,781 --> 00:14:41,178
What? I can't airbend in the spirit world!

169
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,564
You don't know where Sokka is, do you?

170
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:11,857
You're Avatar Roku's animal guide! Like Appa is to me.

171
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:14,212
I need to save my friend and I don't know how.

172
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:18,740
Is there some way for me to talk to Roku?

173
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:27,949
I'll be back Katara. Take me to Roku!

174
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:44,705
What's the problem?

175
00:15:44,825 --> 00:15:50,114
Nothing. Actually, there is a bit of a problem.

176
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:55,951
My old joints are feeling sore and achy and these shackles are too loose.

177
00:15:56,074 --> 00:15:57,297
Too loose?

178
00:15:57,391 --> 00:16:02,597
That's right. The cuffs are loose and they jangle around and bump my wrists.

179
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:07,796
It would help me if you would tighten them so they wouldn't shake around so much.

180
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:13,426
Very well. Corporal, tighten the prisoner's hand cuffs.

181
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:41,023
Hey, what are you doing!?

182
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,678
I don't understand. This is just a statue of Roku.

183
00:17:01,223 --> 00:17:09,814
Is that what Roku wants to talk to me about? A comet? When can I talk to him?

184
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:39,763
It's a calendar, and the light will reach Roku on the solstice!

185
00:17:39,898 --> 00:17:43,695
So, that's when I'll be able to speak to Roku?

186
00:17:43,827 --> 00:17:49,223
But I can't wait that long.
I need to save Sokka now.

187
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:05,728
He is too dangerous, Captain. We can't just carry him to the capital.

188
00:18:05,838 --> 00:18:07,420
We have to do something now.

189
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:13,862
I agree. He must be dealt with immediately and severely.

190
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,737
It's no use, Appa. I don't see them anywhere.

191
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:23,836
Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait.

192
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:31,665
The Avatar!

193
00:19:14,884 --> 00:19:16,872
You're back!

194
00:19:17,811 --> 00:19:19,725
Where's Sokka?

195
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,211
I'm not sure.

196
00:19:27,015 --> 00:19:31,102
These dangerous hands must be crushed.

197
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,939
Excellent form, Prince Zuko.

198
00:19:43,053 --> 00:19:44,236
You taught me well.

199
00:19:44,345 --> 00:19:49,402
Surrender yourselves, it's five against two. You're clearly outnumbered.

200
00:19:49,552 --> 00:19:56,266
Uh, that's true, but you are clearly outmatched!

201
00:20:30,368 --> 00:20:35,195
Now would you please put on some clothes!

202
00:20:55,983 --> 00:21:00,212
Aang, what are you doing? Run!

203
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:20,260
You're the spirit of this forest. Now I understand.

204
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:24,062
You're upset and angry because your home was burned down.

205
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:27,266
When I saw the forest had burned I was sad and upset.

206
00:21:27,354 --> 00:21:32,671
But my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back.

207
00:21:50,438 --> 00:21:52,849
Sokka!

208
00:21:53,401 --> 00:21:54,373
What happened?

209
00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:58,848
You were trapped in the Spirit world for 24 hours. How are you feeling?

210
00:21:58,962 --> 00:22:02,905
Like I seriously need to use the bathroom!

211
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:08,386
Thank you, Avatar. If there only were a way to repay you for what you've done.

212
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:11,242
You could give us some supplies and some money.

213
00:22:11,379 --> 00:22:12,291
Sokka!

214
00:22:12,385 --> 00:22:14,615
What? We need stuff.

215
00:22:14,714 --> 00:22:18,630
It would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey.

216
00:22:18,722 --> 00:22:22,834
I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do all on your own.

217
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:29,407
Actually, I did have a little help. And there's something else.

218
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:31,572
What is it?

219
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:35,845
I need to talk to Roku and I think I've found a way to contact his spirit.

220
00:22:36,002 --> 00:22:37,029
That's great!

221
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:38,634
Creepy, but great.

222
00:22:38,734 --> 00:22:41,138
There's a temple on a crescent shaped island,...

223
00:22:41,251 --> 00:22:44,790
...and if I go there on the solstice I'll be able to speak with him.

224
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:46,852
But, the solstice is tomorrow.

225
00:22:46,947 --> 00:22:54,379
Yeh, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.

00:00:00,749 --> 00:00:03,121
<i>Water.</i>

2
00:00:03,122 --> 00:00:04,995
<i>Earth.</i>

3
00:00:04,996 --> 00:00:07,104
<i>Fire.</i>

4
00:00:07,105 --> 00:00:08,396
<i>Air.</i>

5
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:13,596
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:17,675
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:21,988
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,148
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,489 --> 00:00:29,310
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,150
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,356
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:37,089
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,712
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

14
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,274
Previously on "Avatar"...

15
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:54,456
When the Avatar dies he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle.

16
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:56,999
But there's no one who can teach me how to be the Avatar.

17
00:00:57,086 --> 00:01:00,180
Monk Gyatso said that Avatar Roku would help me.

18
00:01:00,264 --> 00:01:02,014
The Avatar before you?

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,114
He died over a hundred years ago, how are you supposed to talk to him?

20
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:07,205
There's a temple on a crescent shaped island,...

21
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:10,451
...and if I go there on the solstice I'll be able to speak with him.

22
00:01:10,546 --> 00:01:12,546
But, the solstice is tomorrow.

23
00:01:12,664 --> 00:01:17,961
Yeh, and there's one more problem. The island is in the Fire Nation.

24
00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:22,948
Book One: Water | Chapter Eight:
Avatar Roku (Winter Solstice, Part 2)

25
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:35,303
Let's go Appa! Come on, boy!

26
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:39,981
Look, I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't coming to the Fire Nation with us.

27
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:43,340
If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself.

28
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:47,915
So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!

29
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:51,451
I think his big butt is trying to tell you something.

30
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:52,875
Please don't go, Aang.

31
00:01:52,983 --> 00:01:59,238
The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Neither can I.

32
00:02:02,249 --> 00:02:05,912
But I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means.

33
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:12,988
I need to get to the Fire Temple before the sun sets on the Solstice. That's today.

34
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:17,964
We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.

35
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:23,548
At least not without your friends. We got your back.

36
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:28,174
It's a long journey to the Crescent Island.

37
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:32,396
You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it before sundown.

38
00:02:32,492 --> 00:02:33,625
Good luck.

39
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:34,707
Thank you, for your...

40
00:02:34,802 --> 00:02:36,784
Go!

41
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:49,735
Having trouble sleeping? Seen the Avatar lately?

42
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:02,385
Come on, boy! We've got a long way to go! Faster!

43
00:03:05,715 --> 00:03:09,143
Sailing into Fire Nation waters...

44
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:14,285
...of all the foolish things you have done in your 16 years, Prince Zuko,...

45
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,953
...this is the most foolish.

46
00:03:17,055 --> 00:03:18,695
I have no choice, Uncle.

47
00:03:18,802 --> 00:03:23,621
Have you completely forgotten that the Fire Lord banished you?!?!?

48
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:25,227
What if you're caught?

49
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:29,320
I'm chasing the Avatar. My father will understand why I'm returning home.

50
00:03:29,405 --> 00:03:36,618
You give him too much credit. My brother is not the understanding type.

51
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:42,909
There they are! Helmsman, full steam ahead!

52
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:44,729
Aang, we got trouble.

53
00:03:44,806 --> 00:03:48,217
Yeah, and its gaining fast!

54
00:03:54,381 --> 00:04:01,690
Really, Prince Zuko, couldn't you shoot them down with something more fragrant?

55
00:04:02,556 --> 00:04:06,946
On my mark... Fire!

56
00:04:08,006 --> 00:04:09,866
Fire ball!

57
00:04:09,967 --> 00:04:11,632
I'm on it!

58
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:19,003
We have to get out of Zuko's range before he shoots another hot stinker at us!

59
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:21,200
Can't you make Appa go any faster?

60
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,450
Yeah, but there's just one little problem.

61
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:26,822
A blockade!

62
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,038
Technically you are still in Earth Kingdom waters.

63
00:04:35,138 --> 00:04:37,912
Turn back now and they cannot arrest you.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,105
If we fly north we can go around the Fire Nation ships and avoid the blockade.

65
00:04:42,196 --> 00:04:43,472
It's the only way.

66
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:44,797
There's no time.

67
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:48,389
This is exactly why I didn't want you to come. Its too dangerous.

68
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,565
And that's exactly why we're here.

69
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,033
Let's run this blockade.

70
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:56,020
Appa! Yip! Yip!

71
00:04:56,757 --> 00:04:58,316
He's not turning around.

72
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:04,069
Please Prince Zuko, if the Fire Nation captures you, there is nothing I can do.

73
00:05:04,186 --> 00:05:06,673
Do not follow the Avatar.

74
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:11,579
I'm sorry, Uncle. Run the blockade!

75
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:19,063
The Avatar... and the banished Prince. This must be my lucky day.

76
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:21,498
Commander Zhao, what are your orders?

77
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,556
Shoot the Bison down, Captain.

78
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:27,725
But there's a Fire Navy ship out there, Sir, one of our own. What if it's hit?

79
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,784
So be it. It belongs to a traitor. Ignite!

80
00:05:35,517 --> 00:05:37,756
Launch!!!

81
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:02,086
Appa! Are you ok?

82
00:06:14,592 --> 00:06:19,576
Prince Zuko, the engines are damaged! We need to stop and make repairs!

83
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:21,821
Do not stop this ship.

84
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:24,097
Launch!

85
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:47,310
Sokka...!

86
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:10,398
Ready...

87
00:07:14,046 --> 00:07:16,294
Fire!

88
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,763
We made it!!!

89
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:41,171
We got into the Fire Nation... Great...

90
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,562
Where do you think the Avatar is headed, Sir?

91
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:50,133
I'm not sure. But I bet a certain banished prince will know.

92
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:52,466
We're on a collision course!

93
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,732
We can make it!

94
00:07:53,825 --> 00:07:57,166
The boarding party is ready to apprehend Prince Zuko, Sir.

95
00:07:57,231 --> 00:08:00,491
Wait. Cut the engines. Let them pass.

96
00:08:00,597 --> 00:08:02,767
Sir?

97
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:29,436
There it is! The island Roku's dragon took me to!

98
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:36,554
You did it buddy. Nice flying.

99
00:08:36,676 --> 00:08:38,859
Oh! You must be tired!

100
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:44,666
No. I'm good. Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders.

101
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:47,004
I was talking to Appa.

102
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:51,006
Well, I was talking to Momo.

103
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:58,762
I don't see any guards.

104
00:08:58,856 --> 00:09:02,549
The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died.

105
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:06,388
Its almost sundown. We'd better hurry.

106
00:09:14,508 --> 00:09:18,245
Wait... I think I heard something.

107
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:24,747
We are the Fire Sages. Guardians of the temple of the Avatar.

108
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:27,181
Great! I am the Avatar.

109
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,268
We know.

110
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:36,258
I'll hold them off. Run!

111
00:09:38,955 --> 00:09:44,073
If the Avatar contacts Roku, there's no telling how powerful the boy will become.

112
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:47,715
Split up and find him!

113
00:09:49,834 --> 00:09:50,835
Follow me!

114
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:52,414
Do you know where you're going?

115
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,697
Nope!

116
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:56,402
Wrong way!

117
00:09:56,893 --> 00:09:58,570
Come back!

118
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:07,472
I don't want to fight you. I am a friend.

119
00:10:07,581 --> 00:10:11,296
Firebenders aren't our friends.

120
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:14,484
I know why you're here, Avatar.

121
00:10:14,598 --> 00:10:15,568
You do?

122
00:10:15,672 --> 00:10:21,189
Yes. You wish to speak to Avatar Roku. I can take you to him.

123
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,385
How?

124
00:10:27,637 --> 00:10:29,534
This way.

125
00:10:31,902 --> 00:10:35,143
Time is running out. Quickly!

126
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:46,177
What's he up to, Uncle? Why didn't Commander Zhao arrest me?

127
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,887
Because he wants to follow you.

128
00:10:48,946 --> 00:10:53,978
He knows you'll lead him to the prize you're both after... the Avatar.

129
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:59,820
If Zhao wants to follow our trail of smoke, then that's exactly what I'll let him do.

130
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:02,797
Avatar Roku once called this temple his home.

131
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:06,035
He formed these secret passages out of the magma.

132
00:11:06,113 --> 00:11:07,733
Did you know Avatar Roku?

133
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:10,884
No. But my grandfather knew him.

134
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:15,549
Many generations of Fire Sages guarded this temple long before me.

135
00:11:15,636 --> 00:11:19,198
We all have a strong spiritual connection to this place.

136
00:11:19,297 --> 00:11:21,096
Is that how you knew I was coming?

137
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:24,428
A few weeks ago, an amazing thing occurred.

138
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:28,638
The statue of Avatar Roku, its eyes... began to glow!

139
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:33,438
That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there too!

140
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:37,777
At that moment, we knew you had returned to the world.

141
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:41,586
If this is the Avatar's temple, why did the Sages attack me?

142
00:11:41,669 --> 00:11:47,321
Things have changed. In the past, the Sages were loyal only to the Avatar.

143
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:52,551
When Roku died, the Sages eagerly awaited for the next Avatar to return.

144
00:11:52,663 --> 00:11:54,334
But he never came.

145
00:11:54,437 --> 00:11:55,986
They were waiting for me.

146
00:11:56,075 --> 00:11:59,077
Hey, don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late.

147
00:11:59,173 --> 00:12:02,048
They lost hope the Avatar would ever return.

148
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,873
When Fire Lord Sozen began the war,...

149
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:09,219
...my grandfather and the other Sages were forced to follow him.

150
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:14,159
I never wanted to serve the Fire Lord. When I learned you were coming,...

151
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:17,001
...I knew I would have to betray the other Sages.

152
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:20,544
Thank you for helping me.

153
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,489
We'll follow these stairs to the sanctuary.

154
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:28,436
Once you're inside, wait for the light to hit Avatar Roku's statue.

155
00:12:28,531 --> 00:12:33,800
Only then will you be able to speak with him.

156
00:12:40,169 --> 00:12:42,246
No!

157
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:43,553
Shyu, what's wrong?

158
00:12:43,657 --> 00:12:46,908
The sanctuary doors, they're closed.

159
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:50,812
Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?

160
00:12:50,924 --> 00:12:57,129
No. Only a fully realized Avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone.

161
00:12:57,228 --> 00:13:03,841
Otherwise the Sages must open the doors together with five simultaneous fire blasts.

162
00:13:03,932 --> 00:13:10,391
Five fire blasts, huh? I think I can help you out.

163
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:18,405
Uncle, keep heading north. Zhao will follow the smoke trail while I use it as a cover.

164
00:13:26,136 --> 00:13:28,709
This is a little trick I picked up from my father.

165
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:32,050
I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing,...

166
00:13:32,155 --> 00:13:37,029
...Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and tada! Fake firebending!

167
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:39,540
You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.

168
00:13:39,636 --> 00:13:44,051
This might actually work.

169
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:50,743
The Sages will hear the explosions, so as soon as they go off, you rush in.

170
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,020
Its almost sunset. Are you ready?

171
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:55,152
Definitely.

172
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:13,342
They're still locked.

173
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:17,913
It didn't work.

174
00:14:25,395 --> 00:14:29,727
Why won't it open! Aargh!

175
00:14:29,837 --> 00:14:33,148
Aang, stop! There's nothing else we can do.

176
00:14:33,264 --> 00:14:36,796
I'm sorry I put you through all this for nothing.

177
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:42,144
I don't get it. That blast looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.

178
00:14:42,243 --> 00:14:44,842
Sokka! You're a genius!

179
00:14:44,948 --> 00:14:48,353
Wait, how is Sokka genius? His plan didn't even work.

180
00:14:48,465 --> 00:14:51,054
Come on Aang, let her dream.

181
00:14:51,168 --> 00:14:56,501
You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work... but it looks like it did.

182
00:14:56,597 --> 00:15:00,524
Did the definition of "genius" change in the last hundred years?

183
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,585
Come Quickly! The Avatar has entered the sanctuary.

184
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,993
How did he get in?

185
00:15:05,103 --> 00:15:10,606
I don't know. But look at the scorch marks and down there!

186
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:19,382
He's inside. Open the doors immediately before he contacts Avatar Roku.

187
00:15:31,781 --> 00:15:33,711
It's the Avatar's lemur!

188
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:40,100
He must have crawled through the pipes! We've been tricked!

189
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,123
Now, Aang!

190
00:15:44,298 --> 00:15:47,878
Aang! Now's your chance!

191
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:51,645
The Avatar's coming with me!

192
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:58,658
Close the doors! Quickly!

193
00:16:04,691 --> 00:16:06,348
Go!

194
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,776
He made it!

195
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:32,913
The light hits the statue and I talk to Roku. So why isn't anything happening?

196
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,812
Why isn't it working? It's sealed shut!

197
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:46,001
It must have been the light. Avatar Roku doesn't want us inside.

198
00:16:46,144 --> 00:16:49,916
Why isn't anything happening? I don't know what I'm doing!

199
00:16:50,036 --> 00:16:56,115
All I know is airbending! Please, Avatar Roku, talk to me!

200
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:08,565
It's good to see you, Aang. What took you so long?

201
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:12,821
Why did you help the Avatar?

202
00:17:12,954 --> 00:17:20,448
Because it was once the Sages' duty. It is still our duty.

203
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:26,094
What a moving and heartfelt performance.

204
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:31,731
I'm certain the Fire Lord will understand when you explain why you betrayed him.

205
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,529
Commander Zhao...

206
00:17:33,651 --> 00:17:40,684
And Prince Zuko, it was a noble effort. But your little smoke screen didn't work.

207
00:17:40,781 --> 00:17:45,587
Two traitors, in one day, the Fire Lord will be pleased.

208
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:49,937
You're too late, Zhao. The Avatar's inside and the doors are sealed.

209
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:56,865
No matter. Sooner or later, he has to come out.

210
00:17:58,442 --> 00:18:02,503
I have something very important to tell you, Aang.

211
00:18:02,612 --> 00:18:09,389
That is why, when you were in the spirit world, I sent my dragon to find you.

212
00:18:09,493 --> 00:18:12,362
Is it about that vision? The one with the comet?

213
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,556
Yes.

214
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,903
What does it mean?

215
00:18:14,996 --> 00:18:21,418
One hundred years ago, Fire Lord Sozen used that comet to begin the war.

216
00:18:21,504 --> 00:18:25,972
He and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power...

217
00:18:26,061 --> 00:18:30,293
...and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations.

218
00:18:30,384 --> 00:18:32,507
So the comet made them stronger?

219
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,530
Yes. Stronger than you could even imagine.

220
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,360
But that happened a hundred years ago.

221
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:40,843
What does the comet have to do with the war now?

222
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:46,255
Listen carefully. Sozen's comet will return by the end of the summer.

223
00:18:46,376 --> 00:18:54,083
And Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the war once and for all.

224
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,893
If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to restore balance to the world.

225
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:05,948
Aang, you must defeat the Fire Lord before the comet arrives.

226
00:19:06,065 --> 00:19:10,057
But I haven't even started learning waterbending, not to mention earth and fire.

227
00:19:10,161 --> 00:19:14,443
Mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice.

228
00:19:14,551 --> 00:19:22,477
But if the world is to survive, you must do it by summer's end.

229
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:32,159
When those doors open, unleash all your fire power.

230
00:19:32,288 --> 00:19:34,001
How's Aang going to make it out of this?

231
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,994
How're we going to make it out of this?

232
00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:42,078
What if I can't master all the elements in time? What if I fail?

233
00:19:42,218 --> 00:19:48,073
I know you can do it Aang, for you have done it before.

234
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:54,925
The solstice is ending. We must go our separate ways... for now.

235
00:19:55,035 --> 00:19:57,406
But I won't be able to come back to the temple.

236
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:00,268
What if I have questions? How will I talk to you?

237
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:10,313
I am a part of you. When you need to talk to me again, you will find a way.

238
00:20:10,446 --> 00:20:14,340
A great danger awaits you at the temple.

239
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:20,615
I can help you face the threat. But only if you are ready.

240
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:23,201
I'm ready.

241
00:20:32,352 --> 00:20:35,023
Ready...

242
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:36,976
No! Aang!

243
00:20:37,122 --> 00:20:39,008
Fire!

244
00:20:44,829 --> 00:20:47,601
Avatar Roku!

245
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,284
Avatar Roku's going to destroy the temple! We have to get out of here!

246
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:04,825
Not without Aang!

247
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,584
We got your back.

248
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:37,721
Thanks. Where's Shyu?

249
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:39,996
I don't know.

250
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:11,391
No prince. No Avatar. Apparently the only thing I do have is five traitors.

251
00:22:11,503 --> 00:22:14,239
But Commander, only Shyu helped the Avatar.

252
00:22:14,388 --> 00:22:16,737
Save your stories for the Fire Lord.

253
00:22:16,841 --> 00:22:24,650
As far as I'm concerned, you're all guilty! Take them to the prison hold!

13

Book One: Water
Chapter Nine: The Waterbending Scroll

15
00:01:01,926 --> 00:01:06,838
Would you sit down? If we hit a bump you'll go flying off! What's bugging you anyway?

16
00:01:06,938 --> 00:01:08,617
It's what Avatar Roku said.

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:11,986
I'm supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives.

18
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:12,906
Well, let's see,...

19
00:01:12,976 --> 00:01:16,773
...you've pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you 112 years...

20
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:19,961
...I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.

21
00:01:20,059 --> 00:01:24,021
I haven't even started waterbending and we're still weeks away from the North Pole!

22
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:25,679
What am I gonna do!?

23
00:01:25,758 --> 00:01:28,412
Calm down. It's going to be okay.

24
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:31,675
If you want, I can try and teach you some of the stuff I know.

25
00:01:31,772 --> 00:01:33,508
You'd do that?

26
00:01:33,616 --> 00:01:36,682
We'll need to find a good source of water first.

27
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:41,736
Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.

28
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:44,529
Nice puddle.

29
00:01:53,506 --> 00:01:55,922
Yehhh! Don't start without me, boy!

30
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:57,687
Remember the reason we're here.

31
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,708
Oh right, time to practice waterbending.

32
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,962
Great. So what am I supposed to do?

33
00:02:03,072 --> 00:02:07,114
You could... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes?

34
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,327
So, while you guys are playing in the water,...

35
00:02:09,426 --> 00:02:13,019
...I'm supposed to be hard at work picking the mud out of a giant bison's feet?

36
00:02:13,118 --> 00:02:15,721
Mud and bugs!

37
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,763
Okay.

38
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:32,721
Someone's changing our course!

39
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:36,107
What's the meaning of this mutiny? No one told you to change course!

40
00:02:36,204 --> 00:02:43,346
Actually, someone did. I assure you it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince Zuko.

41
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,270
Is it something to do with the Avatar?

42
00:02:45,384 --> 00:02:51,747
Even more urgent. It seems... I've lost my lotus tile.

43
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,002
Lotus tile?

44
00:02:53,097 --> 00:02:58,278
For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant,...

45
00:02:58,383 --> 00:03:03,685
...but it is essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.

46
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:06,742
You've changed our course for a stupid lotus tile?

47
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:10,906
See, you, like most people, underestimate its value.

48
00:03:10,999 --> 00:03:14,590
Just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call.

49
00:03:14,674 --> 00:03:23,199
Hopefully they'll have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life!

50
00:03:23,297 --> 00:03:29,434
I'm lucky to have such an understanding nephew.

51
00:03:29,637 --> 00:03:34,567
Yeh, don't get too happy. You gotta do me next.

52
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:38,440
This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect,...

53
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:42,323
...so don't be frustrated if you don't get it right away.

54
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:45,185
Just push and pull the water like this...

55
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:48,583
The key is getting the wrist movement right.

56
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:51,811
Like this?

57
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,394
That's almost right, if you keep practicing, I'm sure eventually...

58
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:58,191
Hey, I'm bending it already!

59
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:01,177
Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly.

60
00:04:01,255 --> 00:04:03,434
It took me two months to learn that move.

61
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,283
Well, you had to figure it out on your own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.

62
00:04:08,369 --> 00:04:09,529
Thanks.

63
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,820
So, what's next?

64
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:17,455
This is a more difficult move. I call it "streaming the water."

65
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:23,706
It's harder than it looks so don't be disappointed if...

66
00:04:31,078 --> 00:04:34,967
Nice work, though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.

67
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:39,000
Sorry. Well, don't stop now, keep'em coming!

68
00:04:39,117 --> 00:04:42,248
Well, I kinda know this one other move, but it's pretty hard.

69
00:04:42,347 --> 00:04:50,974
I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave...

70
00:04:53,415 --> 00:04:57,179
So, like this?

71
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:02,481
Aang!

72
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:12,105
Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else ya got?

73
00:05:12,217 --> 00:05:14,174
That's enough practicing for today.

74
00:05:14,283 --> 00:05:18,132
Yeh, I'll say! You just practiced our supplies down the river!

75
00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:23,035
Uhhh... sorry. I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff.

76
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:28,773
Ugh, it was hard enough when you were just an airbender.

77
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:51,050
We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us.

78
00:05:51,127 --> 00:05:52,438
Let's spend it wisely.

79
00:05:52,534 --> 00:05:59,121
Uhh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle!

80
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,863
It doesn't even work.

81
00:06:04,511 --> 00:06:07,667
See, even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.

82
00:06:07,777 --> 00:06:13,673
No offense, Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on.

83
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:19,595
Earth Nation! Fire Nation! Water Nation!

84
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:23,947
So long as bargains are your inclination, you're welcome here!

85
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:27,190
Don't be shy, come one by!

86
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:32,800
Oh! You there! I can see by your clothing that you're world traveling types.

87
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,604
Perhaps I can interest you in some exotic curios?

88
00:06:36,706 --> 00:06:40,943
Sure! What are curios?

89
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:45,969
I'm not entirely sure, but we got 'em!

90
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:04,663
I've never seen such a fine specimen of lemur.

91
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:12,376
That beast would fetch me a hefty sum if you'd be, interested in bartering.

92
00:07:12,553 --> 00:07:14,983
Momo's not for sale.

93
00:07:23,383 --> 00:07:29,190
Look at this, Aang! It's a waterbending scroll. Check out these crazy moves!

94
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:32,264
Where did you get a waterbending scroll?

95
00:07:32,365 --> 00:07:40,551
Let's just say I got it up north at a most reasonable price. Free!

96
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:47,065
Waaait a minute "sea-loving traders" with suspiciously acquired merchandise...

97
00:07:47,168 --> 00:07:51,776
...and pet reptile birds... You guys are pirates!

98
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:56,645
We prefer to think of ourselves as high risk traders.

99
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,661
So, how much for the, uh, "traded" scroll?

100
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:03,296
I've already got a buyer, a nobleman in the Earth Kingdom.

101
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:08,821
Unless, of course, you kids have 200 gold pieces on ya right now?

102
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:14,552
I know how to deal with these guys, Katara, pirates love to haggle.

103
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:22,543
Watch and learn. What say to the price of... one copper piece!

104
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:29,244
The price is 200 gold pieces. I don't haggle on items this rare.

105
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,163
Okay... two copper pieces!

106
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,999
It's not as amusing the second time, boy.

107
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,801
Aang, can we get out of here, I feel like we're getting weird looks.

108
00:08:38,892 --> 00:08:42,128
Aye, we be castin' off now!

109
00:08:42,227 --> 00:08:43,917
What was that all about, Katara.

110
00:08:44,016 --> 00:08:47,273
Yeh, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.

111
00:08:47,367 --> 00:08:50,083
I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.

112
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,659
Hey you, get back here!

113
00:08:52,749 --> 00:09:00,928
Well, well, look who's come to their senses. Told ya the haggling would pay off.

114
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,026
There they are!

115
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:10,063
Get 'em!

116
00:09:10,142 --> 00:09:13,982
Nobody's goin' nowhere!

117
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:18,436
I... I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us!

118
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:21,140
Get back here!

119
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:26,743
This way! Let's cut 'em off!

120
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:52,109
My cabbages! This place is worse than Omashu!

121
00:10:01,457 --> 00:10:05,898
I hope that lemur of yours has nine lives!

122
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:11,309
Now, who gets to take the steel of my blade first?

123
00:10:11,415 --> 00:10:13,088
No thanks!

124
00:10:16,374 --> 00:10:17,498
Hold on tight!

125
00:10:17,585 --> 00:10:21,231
Aang, I thought we were running away from the pirates!

126
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:23,859
Just hang on!

127
00:10:30,373 --> 00:10:33,729
I used to kinda look up to pirates, but those guys are terrible.

128
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:37,224
I know, that's why I took... this!

129
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:38,277
No way.

130
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:39,644
Isn't it great?

131
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:43,740
No wonder they were trying to hack us up. You stole their waterbending scroll.

132
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:48,351
I prefer to think of it as "high-risk trading."

133
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:49,673
Good one, Katara.

134
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:54,510
Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender.

135
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:55,713
It doesn't matter.

136
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,404
You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes!

137
00:11:00,473 --> 00:11:03,187
These are real waterbending forms.

138
00:11:03,264 --> 00:11:07,895
You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending.

139
00:11:07,978 --> 00:11:09,094
Whatever.

140
00:11:09,175 --> 00:11:15,596
Well, what's done is done. We have it. We might as well learn from it.

141
00:11:21,762 --> 00:11:28,551
I've checked all the shops on this pier. Not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace.

142
00:11:28,642 --> 00:11:32,136
It's good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone!

143
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,969
Quite the contrary.

144
00:11:34,071 --> 00:11:39,207
I always say the only thing better than finding something you were looking for,...

145
00:11:39,298 --> 00:11:45,515
...is finding something you weren't looking for at a great bargain!

146
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,431
You bought a sumki horn?

147
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,505
For music night on the ship. Now, if we only had some woodwinds.

148
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:56,842
This place looks promising!

149
00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:02,086
Ooo! That is handsome! Wouldn't it look magnificent in the galley?

150
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:06,244
We lost the Water Tribe girl and the little bald monk she was traveling with.

151
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:10,918
This monk, did he have an arrow on his head?

152
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,735
I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours.

153
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:17,465
Here, hold on and open for me.

154
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:23,853
"The single water whip"... looks doable.

155
00:12:29,127 --> 00:12:30,707
What's so funny?

156
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:32,602
I'm sorry, but you deserve that.

157
00:12:32,682 --> 00:12:35,640
You've been duped. She's only interested in teaching herself.

158
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:40,852
Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip!

159
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:45,867
Why can't I get this stupid move!

160
00:12:45,942 --> 00:12:48,167
You'll get it.

161
00:12:49,496 --> 00:12:52,553
You just gotta shift your weight through the stances...

162
00:12:52,634 --> 00:12:54,665
There. See, the key to bending is...

163
00:12:54,751 --> 00:12:56,892
Will you please shut your air hole!

164
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,483
Believe it or not, your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes.

165
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,445
Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted!

166
00:13:06,515 --> 00:13:08,026
What?

167
00:13:10,484 --> 00:13:16,524
Omigosh, Aang, I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me.

168
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:21,338
But, you know what, it won't happen again. Here, this is yours.

169
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,804
I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.

170
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,201
It's okay, Katara.

171
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,939
What about Momo? He's the real victim here.

172
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:29,371
I'm sorry Momo.

173
00:13:29,486 --> 00:13:31,483
And... what about me? There was that time you...

174
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:35,281
No more apologies!

175
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:46,540
Shouldn't we stop to search the woods?

176
00:13:46,641 --> 00:13:50,885
We don't need to stop. They stole a waterbending scroll, right?

177
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:54,878
Then they'll be on the water.

178
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:18,549
Shh! Momo, go back to sleep.

179
00:14:31,851 --> 00:14:37,359
Shoot! Come on water, work with me here!

180
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:46,363
Okay, Katara, shift your weight through the stances... ugh!

181
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:54,711
No, let go of me!

182
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:59,036
I'll save you from the pirates.

183
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,786
Tell me where he is and I won't hurt you or your brother.

184
00:15:07,858 --> 00:15:10,824
Go jump in the river!

185
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:15,229
Try to understand, I need to capture to restore something I've lost.

186
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:21,807
My honor. Perhaps in exchange I can restore something you've lost.

187
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:25,791
My mother's necklace! How did you get that?

188
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:30,564
I didn't steal it, if that's what you're wondering. Tell me where he is.

189
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,401
No!

190
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:36,416
Enough of this necklace garbage. You promised the scroll!

191
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:39,945
I wonder how much money this is worth?

192
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:42,237
A lot, apparently.

193
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:47,594
Now you help me find what I want, you'll get this back and everyone goes home happy.

194
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,865
Search the woods for the boy and meet back here.

195
00:15:49,938 --> 00:15:52,221
Fine.

196
00:15:56,302 --> 00:16:00,731
Huh? Where did she go? I don't believe it.

197
00:16:00,806 --> 00:16:01,731
What's wrong?

198
00:16:01,826 --> 00:16:04,526
She took the scroll! She's obsessed with that thing.

199
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,768
It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep...

200
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,666
I got him, come on!

201
00:16:22,766 --> 00:16:28,033
Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap?

202
00:16:30,788 --> 00:16:32,849
Nice work.

203
00:16:38,002 --> 00:16:40,016
Aang, this is all my fault.

204
00:16:40,094 --> 00:16:41,550
No, Katara it isn't.

205
00:16:41,644 --> 00:16:44,246
Yeh, it kind of is.

206
00:16:44,351 --> 00:16:45,864
Give me the boy.

207
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:48,406
You give us the scroll.

208
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:52,471
You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment!?

209
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:55,798
Don't listen to him! He's trying to turn us against each other.

210
00:16:55,901 --> 00:16:58,426
Your friend is the Avatar?

211
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,190
Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market then that fancy scroll.

212
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:05,942
Shut your mouth, you water tribe peasant!

213
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:09,363
Yeh, Sokka, you really should shut your mouth...

214
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:11,987
I'm just sayin', it's bad business sense.

215
00:17:12,097 --> 00:17:15,003
Just imagine how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar.

216
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:17,518
You guys would be set for life!

217
00:17:17,623 --> 00:17:22,690
Keep the scroll! We can buy a hundred with the reward we will get for the kid.

218
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,712
You'll regret breaking a deal with me!

219
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:52,101
Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples.

220
00:18:31,687 --> 00:18:34,066
Aang, are you there?

221
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:36,319
I'm over here, follow my voice!

222
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,093
Where? I can't find you!

223
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:40,771
I'm right here!

224
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:47,975
Uhh, never mind! I'll find you!

225
00:18:48,035 --> 00:18:50,569
Run!

226
00:18:51,244 --> 00:18:52,962
Katara! You're okay!

227
00:18:53,053 --> 00:18:58,063
Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get out of here!

228
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,475
We need a team of rhinos to budge this ship.

229
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:07,471
A team of rhinos... or two waterbenders?

230
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,459
Everybody in!

231
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:26,016
Are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail?

232
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:28,327
We have no time for your proverbs, Uncle!

233
00:19:28,393 --> 00:19:31,203
It's no proverb.

234
00:19:31,268 --> 00:19:34,643
Bleeding hog-monkeys!

235
00:19:39,618 --> 00:19:41,986
Hey! That's my boat!

236
00:19:42,082 --> 00:19:44,392
Maybe it should be a proverb.

237
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:46,955
Come on, Uncle!

238
00:19:48,672 --> 00:19:51,262
Sokka! Can't you make it go any faster?

239
00:19:51,352 --> 00:19:56,820
I don't know how. This thing wasn't made by the water tribe.

240
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:13,879
Hey, you did the water whip!

241
00:20:13,952 --> 00:20:15,752
I couldn't have done it without your help!

242
00:20:15,823 --> 00:20:21,370
Will you two quit congratulating each other and help me out!

243
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:38,378
That's good!

244
00:20:46,465 --> 00:20:49,004
Aang, look!

245
00:20:50,575 --> 00:20:53,094
Oh, no!

246
00:21:01,606 --> 00:21:07,180
Have you lost your mind!? This is no time for flute practice!

247
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:13,312
We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water!

248
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:22,428
It's working! It's slowing down!

249
00:21:27,964 --> 00:21:29,427
We're doing it!

250
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:33,068
But we have another problem!

251
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,075
I knew a bison whistle would come in handy. Thanks, Appa.

252
00:21:57,165 --> 00:22:00,324
Yeh, we owe ya one.

253
00:22:02,192 --> 00:22:04,577
My boat!

254
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:13,182
Hehe, Prince Zuko, you're really going to get a kick out of this.

255
00:22:13,282 --> 00:22:19,368
The lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time!

256
00:22:26,128 --> 00:22:29,556
Aang, I still owe you an apology.

257
00:22:29,637 --> 00:22:32,860
You were just so good at waterbending without really trying.

258
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:37,655
I got so competitive that I put us all in danger. I'm sorry.

259
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:39,296
That's okay, Katara.

260
00:22:39,378 --> 00:22:42,429
Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway.

261
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,828
Is that really how you feel?

262
00:22:44,923 --> 00:22:45,878
The scroll!

263
00:22:45,978 --> 00:22:47,893
First, what did you learn?

264
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,004
Stealing is wrong.

265
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,226
Unless it's from pirates!

266
00:22:54,261 --> 00:22:56,341
Good one, Katara.

00:00:09,562 --> 00:00:13,696
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,697 --> 00:00:17,775
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:22,088
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:22,089 --> 00:00:25,248
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,589 --> 00:00:29,410
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,411 --> 00:00:31,250
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:33,456
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:37,189
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,812
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water
Chapter Ten: Jet

15
00:01:15,952 --> 00:01:18,511
Where's Momo?

16
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:23,317
Hang on Momo!

17
00:01:36,491 --> 00:01:38,988
All right... you too.

18
00:01:39,077 --> 00:01:42,335
This is gonna take forever.

19
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:46,058
That works...

20
00:01:49,883 --> 00:01:52,977
These are Fire Nation traps... you can tell from the metalwork.

21
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:57,117
We'd better pack up camp, and get moving.

22
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,369
Ah-ah... no flying this time.

23
00:01:59,473 --> 00:02:00,153
What?

24
00:02:00,261 --> 00:02:01,334
Why wouldn't we fly?

25
00:02:01,426 --> 00:02:04,731
Think about it. Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us.

26
00:02:04,811 --> 00:02:07,428
It's because they spot Appa... he's just too noticeable.

27
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,806
What! Appa's not too noticeable!

28
00:02:09,898 --> 00:02:15,542
He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head... it's kinda hard to miss him!

29
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:18,114
Sokka's just jealous 'cause he doesn't have an arrow.

30
00:02:18,197 --> 00:02:19,133
I know you all want to fly,...

31
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:22,376
...but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk.

32
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,096
Who made you the boss?

33
00:02:24,163 --> 00:02:25,933
I'm not the boss... I'm the leader.

34
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:30,261
You're the leader? But your voice still cracks!

35
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:33,994
I'm the oldest and I'm a warrior. So... I'm the leader!

36
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:37,996
If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean, he is the Avatar.

37
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,892
Are you kidding... he's just a goofy kid!

38
00:02:41,979 --> 00:02:42,742
He's right.

39
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:45,709
Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader?

40
00:02:45,801 --> 00:02:48,377
I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl.

41
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:51,005
I-I've kissed a girl... you... just haven't met her.

42
00:02:51,078 --> 00:02:54,660
Who? Gran-gran? I've met Gran-gran.

43
00:02:54,738 --> 00:02:56,437
No... besides Gran-gran.

44
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:59,787
Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot...

45
00:02:59,838 --> 00:03:02,029
...and a leader has to trust his instincts.

46
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:05,622
Okay, we'll try it your way Oh Wise Leader.

47
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:08,739
Who knows... walking might be fun.

48
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,804
Walking stinks! How do people go anywhere without a flying bison?

49
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:14,080
I don't know Aang.

50
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:18,032
Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts... they seem to know everything.

51
00:03:18,113 --> 00:03:19,404
Haha. Very funny.

52
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:21,539
I'm tired of carrying this pack.

53
00:03:21,633 --> 00:03:25,718
You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's Instincts!

54
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:29,539
That's a great idea! Hey, Sokka's Instincts, would you mind...

55
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:31,030
Okay, okay... I get it.

56
00:03:31,137 --> 00:03:32,794
Look guys, I'm tired too.

57
00:03:32,886 --> 00:03:38,258
But the important thing is that we're safe from... the... Fire... Nation...

58
00:03:41,286 --> 00:03:43,006
Run!

59
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:47,693
We're cut off!

60
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,416
Sokka, your shirt!

61
00:03:58,013 --> 00:04:00,936
If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.

62
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:02,665
What are you doing?

63
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,107
Bluffing?

64
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:09,042
You? Promise not to hurt us?

65
00:04:09,495 --> 00:04:11,871
Nice work, Sokka! How'd ya do that?

66
00:04:11,967 --> 00:04:14,174
Uh... instinct?

67
00:04:14,247 --> 00:04:16,461
Look!

68
00:04:27,427 --> 00:04:29,497
Down you go.

69
00:04:34,293 --> 00:04:36,959
They're in the trees!

70
00:04:55,553 --> 00:04:57,116
Hey, he was mine!

71
00:04:57,208 --> 00:05:00,535
Gotta be quicker next time.

72
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:21,428
Man!

73
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,612
Hey.

74
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,469
Hi.

75
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:38,815
You just took out a whole army almost single-handed!

76
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:43,213
Army? Pfft. There were only, like, twenty guys!

77
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:45,875
My name is Jet, and these are my Freedom Fighters.

78
00:05:45,957 --> 00:05:51,880
Sneers... Longshot... Smellerbee... The Duke and Pipsqueak.

79
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:56,046
Pipsqueak... that's a funny name.

80
00:05:56,539 --> 00:05:59,379
You think my name is funny?

81
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,472
It's hilarious.

82
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:21,276
Um... thanks for saving us Jet. We were lucky you were there.

83
00:06:21,341 --> 00:06:25,429
I should be thanking you. We were waiting to ambush those soldiers all morning...

84
00:06:25,504 --> 00:06:28,738
...we just needed the right distraction. And then you guys stumbled in.

85
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:30,831
We were relying on instincts.

86
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:34,823
You'll get yourself killed doing that.

87
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:40,635
Hey Jet... these barrels are filled with blasting jelly.

88
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:42,354
That's a great score.

89
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,282
And these boxes are filled with jelly candy!

90
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:48,356
Also good. Let's not get those mixed up.

91
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:50,383
We'll take the stuff back to the hideout.

92
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:52,004
You guys have a hideout?

93
00:06:52,086 --> 00:06:52,708
You wanna see it?

94
00:06:52,804 --> 00:06:55,486
Yes we wanna see it!

95
00:06:58,705 --> 00:06:59,660
We're here.

96
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:01,349
Where... there's nothing here?!

97
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,378
Hold this.

98
00:07:02,457 --> 00:07:05,072
Why... what's this do?

99
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:06,859
Aang?

100
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:09,614
I'll get up on my own.

101
00:07:12,203 --> 00:07:15,276
Grab hold of me Katara.

102
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,310
Nice place you got!

103
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,133
It's beautiful up here!

104
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,796
It's beautiful... and more importantly the Fire Nation can't find us.

105
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:43,687
They would love to find you. Wouldn't they, Jet?

106
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,796
It's not gonna happen, Smellerbee.

107
00:07:45,876 --> 00:07:47,861
Why does the Fire Nation want to find you?

108
00:07:47,938 --> 00:07:50,559
I guess you could say I've been causing them a little trouble.

109
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,075
See, they took over a nearby Earth Kingdom town a few years back.

110
00:07:54,145 --> 00:07:57,163
We've been ambushin' their troops, cutting off their supply lines,...

111
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:59,947
...and doing anything we can to mess with 'em.

112
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:03,956
One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation out of here for good and free that town.

113
00:08:04,023 --> 00:08:05,735
That's so brave.

114
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:08,578
Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a treehouse.

115
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,627
Don't pay any attention to my brother.

116
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,146
No problem. He probably had a rough day.

117
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,896
So, you all live here?

118
00:08:14,982 --> 00:08:17,235
That's right. Longshot over there?

119
00:08:17,322 --> 00:08:19,606
His town got burned down by the fire Nation.

120
00:08:19,693 --> 00:08:24,361
And we found the Duke trying to steal our food. I don't think he ever really had a home.

121
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,812
What about you?

122
00:08:27,445 --> 00:08:29,960
Fire Nation killed my parents.

123
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:34,059
I was only eight years old. That day changed me forever.

124
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:37,283
Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation.

125
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:40,711
I'm so sorry, Katara.

126
00:08:49,472 --> 00:08:55,616
Today, we struck another blow against the Fire Nation swine.

127
00:08:56,884 --> 00:09:00,079
I got a special joy from the look on one soldier's face,...

128
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:06,051
...when the Duke dropped down on his helmet and rode him like a wild hog monkey.

129
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,792
Now, the Fire Nation thinks they don't have to worry about a couple of kids...

130
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:18,224
...hiding in the trees. Maybe they're right.

131
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:24,952
Or maybe... they are dead wrong!

132
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:30,622
Hey Jet, nice speech.

133
00:09:30,724 --> 00:09:34,284
Thanks. By the way, I was really impressed with you and Aang.

134
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:36,532
That was some great bending I saw out there today.

135
00:09:36,614 --> 00:09:41,326
Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. I could use some more training.

136
00:09:41,408 --> 00:09:44,658
Avatar huh? Very nice.

137
00:09:44,731 --> 00:09:46,109
Thanks Jet.

138
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:48,772
So I might know a way that you and Aang can help in our struggle.

139
00:09:48,863 --> 00:09:51,599
Unfortunately we have to leave tonight.

140
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:56,470
Sokka, you're kidding me! I needed you on an important mission tomorrow.

141
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:58,417
What mission?

142
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,613
What are you doing?

143
00:10:12,676 --> 00:10:15,431
Shh~ it amplifies vibrations.

144
00:10:15,523 --> 00:10:16,766
Good trick.

145
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:20,910
Nothing yet. Wait! Yes, someone's approaching.

146
00:10:20,986 --> 00:10:21,892
How many?

147
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:24,797
I think there's just one.

148
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:28,216
Good work, Sokka. Ready your weapon.

149
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:35,872
Wait! False alarm... he's just an old man.

150
00:10:39,867 --> 00:10:42,077
What are you doing in our woods, you leech?

151
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:46,115
Please sir, I'm just a traveler.

152
00:10:54,683 --> 00:10:59,228
Do you like destroying towns? Do you like destroying families? Do you?!

153
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:03,159
Oh... please let me go... have mercy...

154
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:08,509
Does the Fire Nation let people go?! Does the Fire Nation have mercy?!

155
00:11:08,573 --> 00:11:10,504
Jet, he's just an old man!

156
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,374
He's Fire Nation! Search him!

157
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:14,010
But he's not hurting anyone!

158
00:11:14,094 --> 00:11:18,423
Have you forgotten that the Fire Nation killed your mother? Remember why you fight!

159
00:11:18,507 --> 00:11:20,141
We've got his stuff, Jet.

160
00:11:20,225 --> 00:11:21,897
This doesn't feel right.

161
00:11:21,994 --> 00:11:25,669
It's what has to be done... now let's get outta here.

162
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:31,377
Come on Sokka!

163
00:11:35,297 --> 00:11:39,309
Sokka! Look what the Duke gave me!

164
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:46,774
Ow! Quit it!

165
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:48,897
Hey Sokka. Is Jet back?

166
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:51,078
Yeah... he's back. But we're leaving.

167
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,953
What?

168
00:11:52,042 --> 00:11:54,452
But I made him this hat.

169
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:56,424
Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.

170
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,790
What? No, he's not.

171
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:00,380
He's messed up Katara.

172
00:12:00,468 --> 00:12:04,952
He's not messed up, he's just got a different way of life... a really fun way of life.

173
00:12:05,036 --> 00:12:08,209
He beat and robbed a harmless old man!

174
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:11,328
I wanna hear Jet's side of the story.

175
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:12,126
Sokka...

176
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:15,547
...you told them what happened but you didn't mention that the guy was Fire Nation?

177
00:12:15,634 --> 00:12:18,404
No, he conveniently left that part out.

178
00:12:18,495 --> 00:12:22,019
Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian.

179
00:12:22,097 --> 00:12:24,956
He was an assassin, Sokka.

180
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:29,147
See? There's a compartment for poison in the knife.

181
00:12:29,237 --> 00:12:32,842
He was sent to eliminate me... you helped save my life, Sokka.

182
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,988
I knew there was an explanation.

183
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:36,645
I didn't see any knife!

184
00:12:36,733 --> 00:12:38,652
That's because he was concealing it.

185
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:42,283
See Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife.

186
00:12:42,352 --> 00:12:47,670
There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things.

187
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:50,743
Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet. I really need your help.

188
00:12:50,827 --> 00:12:51,908
What can we do?

189
00:12:51,993 --> 00:12:54,555
The Fire Nation is planning on burning down our forest.

190
00:12:54,631 --> 00:12:58,349
If you both use water bending to fill the reservoir, we could fight the fires.

191
00:12:58,426 --> 00:13:03,636
But if you leave now, they'll destroy the whole valley.

192
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:09,268
We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest!

193
00:13:09,367 --> 00:13:12,996
I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him.

194
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:17,624
You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader!

195
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,891
Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct...

196
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,419
Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet.

197
00:13:25,494 --> 00:13:26,885
Come on Aang.

198
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:29,413
Sorry Sokka.

199
00:13:38,223 --> 00:13:40,313
Let's go.

200
00:14:02,016 --> 00:14:05,351
Now listen... you are not to blow the dam until I give the signal.

201
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:09,395
If the reservoir isn't full, the Fire Nation troops could survive.

202
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:13,635
But what about the people in the town... won't they get wiped out too?

203
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:17,300
Look Duke, that's the price of ridding this area of the Fire Nation.

204
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:22,548
Now don't blow the dam until I give the signal... got it?

205
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:28,676
Where do you think you're going, ponytail?

206
00:14:31,874 --> 00:14:36,096
Sokka. I'm glad you decided to join us.

207
00:14:36,185 --> 00:14:38,706
I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.

208
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:41,435
Our plan is to rid the valley of the Fire Nation.

209
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:44,974
There are people living there Jet... mothers and fathers and children.

210
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,818
We can't win without making some sacrifices.

211
00:14:47,911 --> 00:14:50,380
You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire!

212
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,215
Because they don't understand the demands of war. Not like you and I do.

213
00:14:54,306 --> 00:14:59,069
I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want.

214
00:14:59,161 --> 00:15:05,214
I was hoping you'd have an open mind, but I can see you've made your choice.

215
00:15:05,293 --> 00:15:10,025
I can't let you warn Katara and Aang. Take him for a walk... a long walk.

216
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,802
You can't do this!

217
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:18,943
Cheer up, Sokka. We're gonna win a great victory against the Fire Nation today.

218
00:15:19,303 --> 00:15:21,995
Jet... I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting.

219
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:24,640
No worries... he already apologized.

220
00:15:24,735 --> 00:15:27,381
Really? Sokka apologized?

221
00:15:27,474 --> 00:15:31,987
Yeah... I was surprised too. I got the sense that maybe you talked to him or something.

222
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:33,174
Yeah, I did.

223
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,102
I guess something you said got through to him.

224
00:15:35,181 --> 00:15:38,726
Anyhow, he went out on a scouting mission with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.

225
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:43,778
I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes.

226
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:48,206
All right, we're here. Underground water's trying to escape through these vents.

227
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,068
I need you guys to help it along.

228
00:15:50,155 --> 00:15:54,609
I've never used bending on water I can't see. I don't know.

229
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,261
Katara. You can do this.

230
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:58,769
What about me?

231
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,715
I know the Avatar can do this.

232
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,962
Yes! Good job!

233
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:28,044
This river empties into the reservoir... a few more geysers and it'll be full.

234
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:31,298
Look, there's another steam vent.

235
00:16:31,388 --> 00:16:36,281
Okay. You two keep it up... I'll go check on things at the reservoir.

236
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:38,143
When we're done we'll meet you over there.

237
00:16:38,226 --> 00:16:44,730
Actually... probably better if you meet me back at the hideout when you're done.

238
00:16:52,115 --> 00:16:55,473
I bet that's enough... and I'm not just saying that to be lazy.

239
00:16:55,572 --> 00:16:57,522
Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir.

240
00:16:57,614 --> 00:16:59,894
I thought we agreed to meet Jet back at the hideout.

241
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:05,739
Well, we finished early... I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.

242
00:17:06,174 --> 00:17:08,303
Come on... move along!

243
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:12,020
How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town?

244
00:17:12,102 --> 00:17:14,694
Hey listen Sokka, Jet's a great leader.

245
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:20,752
We follow what he says, and things always turn out okay.

246
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:26,311
If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn.

247
00:17:26,392 --> 00:17:27,748
Hey!

248
00:17:31,466 --> 00:17:35,824
While you two are up there you might want to practice your knot-work.

249
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:42,692
Hey Smellerbee... you gonna eat your leechee nuts?

250
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,699
What are they doing?

251
00:17:48,794 --> 00:17:51,641
Hey, those are the red barrels he got from the Fire Nation.

252
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:54,308
Why would they need blasting jelly?

253
00:17:54,394 --> 00:17:56,540
Because Jet's gonna blow up the dam.

254
00:17:56,627 --> 00:18:01,207
What? No... that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that.

255
00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:03,139
I've gotta stop him.

256
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,927
Jet wouldn't do that.

257
00:18:07,689 --> 00:18:08,857
Yes I would.

258
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:10,181
Jet... why?

259
00:18:10,272 --> 00:18:13,274
Katara, you would too if you just stopped to think.

260
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,056
Think about what the Fire Nation did to your mother...

261
00:18:16,144 --> 00:18:18,828
...we can't let them do that to anyone else, ever again.

262
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,587
This isn't the answer!

263
00:18:20,668 --> 00:18:23,282
I want you to understand me Katara.

264
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:25,727
I thought your brother would understand, but...

265
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,733
Where's Sokka?

266
00:18:27,835 --> 00:18:30,451
Katara.

267
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,213
I need to get to the dam.

268
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,131
You're not going anywhere without your glider.

269
00:18:43,744 --> 00:18:45,389
I'm not gonna fight you, Jet.

270
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:49,163
You'll have to if you want your glider back.

271
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:36,227
Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me... you're sick and I trusted you!

272
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,414
What are you doing?

273
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:42,598
You're too late.

274
00:20:42,688 --> 00:20:44,305
No!

275
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:52,728
Sokka's still out there... he's our only chance.

276
00:20:52,814 --> 00:20:59,264
Come on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you. Please.

277
00:21:04,816 --> 00:21:06,981
No...

278
00:21:25,611 --> 00:21:27,304
Sokka didn't make it in time.

279
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:31,373
All those people... Jet... you monster!

280
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,199
This was a victory, Katara. Remember that.

281
00:21:34,272 --> 00:21:37,199
The Fire Nation is gone and this valley will be safe.

282
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:41,079
It will be safe... without you.

283
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,276
Sokka!

284
00:21:42,361 --> 00:21:44,989
I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time.

285
00:21:45,069 --> 00:21:45,788
What!

286
00:21:45,879 --> 00:21:49,919
At first they didn't believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy.

287
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,641
But one man vouched for me... the old man you attacked.

288
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:59,519
He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time.

289
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,557
Missus Pretty!

290
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:07,610
Sokka, you fool! We could've freed this valley!

291
00:22:07,691 --> 00:22:10,346
Who would be free... everyone would be dead.

292
00:22:10,431 --> 00:22:11,480
You traitor!

293
00:22:11,578 --> 00:22:15,711
No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people.

294
00:22:15,795 --> 00:22:18,464
Katara. Please... help me.

295
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,794
Goodbye Jet.

296
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:23,235
Yip yip.

297
00:22:26,642 --> 00:22:30,201
We thought you were going to the dam. How come you went to the town instead?

298
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,962
Lemme guess... your instincts told you.

299
00:22:33,067 --> 00:22:34,950
Hey... sometimes they're right.

300
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:38,747
Um... Sokka? You know we're going the wrong way, right?

301
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:41,580
And sometimes they're wrong.

Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top of the tent.

18
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,716
You know, so we don't get rained on.

19
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:13,040
Ordinarily you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not.

20
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:14,892
Besides, that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.

21
00:01:14,947 --> 00:01:16,353
But what if it does rain?

22
00:01:16,397 --> 00:01:20,394
But what if it doesn't? Then I would have put the tarp up for nothing.

23
00:01:20,464 --> 00:01:21,929
You're infuriating!

24
00:01:22,005 --> 00:01:24,410
Katara, why don't you worry about gathering the firewood...

25
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:27,648
...because that kindling's looking pretty sorry.

26
00:01:27,749 --> 00:01:31,174
Well if you don't like my firewood... have it!

27
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,100
Fine by me! If you're not going to do your job... urg!

28
00:01:35,165 --> 00:01:37,425
Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the...

29
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:40,673
Hey, where's the campfire? And what happened to the tent?

30
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:43,703
Why don't you ask Miss Know It All? Queen of the Twigs!

31
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:50,344
Oh yeah? Well you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the... Tents!

32
00:01:50,423 --> 00:01:55,629
Okay, listen guys. Harsh words won't solve problems, action will.

33
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,571
Why don't you just switch jobs?

34
00:01:57,638 --> 00:01:58,931
- Sounds good.
- Whatever.

35
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:06,819
You see that? Settling feuds and making peace. All in a days work for the Avatar.

36
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:26,399
Come on Momo, that's fair. Appa's got five stomachs.

37
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:31,529
Here it is, guys, The Great Divide.

38
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:34,501
Wow! I could just stare at it forever.

39
00:02:34,578 --> 00:02:36,272
Okay. I've seen enough.

40
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:41,639
How can you not be fascinated, Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world.

41
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:45,547
Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away.

42
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:48,769
Hey! If you're looking for the Canyon Guide, I was here first!

43
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:52,021
Ooooo... canyon guide. Sounds informative.

44
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,447
Believe me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender.

45
00:02:55,537 --> 00:02:58,587
And the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help.

46
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,002
And he's takin' my tribe across next!

47
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:02,542
Calm down, we know you're next.

48
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,524
You wouldn't be calm if the Fire Nation destroyed your home and forced you to flee.

49
00:03:06,595 --> 00:03:11,576
My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing Se!

50
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:13,121
You're a refugee.

51
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:16,995
Humph. Tell me somethin' I don't know.

52
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,206
Is that your tribe?

53
00:03:19,307 --> 00:03:20,868
It most certainly is not.

54
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,393
That's the Zhang tribe.
A bunch of low-life thieves.

55
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:28,140
They've been the enemies of my tribe for hundred years.

56
00:03:28,223 --> 00:03:33,180
Hey Zhangs! I'm savin' a spot for my tribe so don't even think of stealing it!

57
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:38,144
Where are the rest of the Gan Jin? Still tidying up their campsite?

58
00:03:38,235 --> 00:03:41,254
Yes! But they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot.

59
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,698
I didn't know the canyon Guide took reservations.

60
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:48,561
Heh! Of course you didn't. That's the ignorance I'd expect from a messy Zhang!

61
00:03:48,643 --> 00:03:53,932
So unorganized and ill prepared for a journey.

62
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:07,876
Sorry about the wait, youngsters. Who's ready to cross this here canyon?

63
00:04:07,977 --> 00:04:10,167
Um... one of them I think.

64
00:04:10,257 --> 00:04:12,590
I was here first! My party's on their way!

65
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:15,439
I can't guide people who aren't here.

66
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,568
Guess you guys'll have to make the trip tomorrow.

67
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:22,203
Wait! Here they come!

68
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,157
You're not seriously going to cave into these spoiled Gan Jins!

69
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:35,591
I mean, we're refugees too! And we've got sick people that need shelter.

70
00:04:35,697 --> 00:04:37,522
I... uh... well...

71
00:04:37,603 --> 00:04:40,122
We've got old people who are weary from traveling.

72
00:04:40,225 --> 00:04:42,928
Sick people get priority over old people.

73
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:47,729
Maybe you Zhang's wouldn't have so many sick people if you weren't such slobs.

74
00:04:47,814 --> 00:04:52,414
If you Gan Jins weren't so clean, maybe you wouldn't live to be so old.

75
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,780
I could smell your stink a mile away.

76
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:55,044
Well Aang, ready to put your peace...

77
00:04:55,131 --> 00:04:56,780
...making skills to the test?

78
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:00,084
I... don't know. A fight over chores is one thing.

79
00:05:00,176 --> 00:05:02,904
These people have been feuding for hundred years.

80
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,103
Everyone, listen up! This is the Avatar! And if you give him a chance,...

81
00:05:08,184 --> 00:05:13,792
...I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy.

82
00:05:13,887 --> 00:05:17,731
Uh... you could share the earthbender and travel together?

83
00:05:17,808 --> 00:05:18,752
Absolutely not!

84
00:05:18,845 --> 00:05:23,374
We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation than travel with those stinking thieves.

85
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:25,962
We wouldn't travel with you pompous fools anyway!

86
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,737
I am not pompous!

87
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,308
Alright! Here's the deal!

88
00:05:29,393 --> 00:05:33,422
We're all going down together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across.

89
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:36,506
Does that seem fair?

90
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:48,865
Sorry Appa. You'll have to do this on your own.

91
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:51,348
And this feuding tribe stuff is serious business.

92
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,587
Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?

93
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:57,987
To tell the truth, I'm not sure. But when have I ever been?

94
00:05:58,098 --> 00:06:02,345
He's the Avatar, Sokka. Making peace between people is his job.

95
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:05,497
His job's gonna make us cross this whole thing on foot, isn't it?

96
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,150
Okay, now comes the bad news.

97
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:14,784
No food allowed in the canyon. It attracts dangerous predators.

98
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,402
No food! This is ridiculous.

99
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:25,657
Aww, you babies can go a day without food. Would you rather be hungry... or dead?

100
00:06:25,746 --> 00:06:28,234
Now, we're headin' down in ten minutes.

101
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:34,358
All food better be in your gut, or in the garbage!

102
00:06:38,512 --> 00:06:42,222
Appas's gonna take good care of you until we get there.

103
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:47,555
See ya on the other side, buddy. Yip, yip!

104
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:01,493
Nice bending!

105
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:07,635
The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information.

106
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:12,019
Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are formed.

107
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:17,717
Experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by Earth Spirits...

108
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:26,652
...who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper sacrifice.

109
00:07:32,508 --> 00:07:40,726
Guess the spirits are still angry! Hope you all brought sacrifices.

110
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:48,713
Okay... everyone stand clear of the wall.

111
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,442
Why'd you do that?

112
00:07:53,531 --> 00:07:56,647
These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they?

113
00:07:56,712 --> 00:08:02,644
I gotta make sure we can't be followed. We'll be safe now.

114
00:08:05,997 --> 00:08:08,913
We gotta help him!

115
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:16,563
Okay... now you gotta help me!

116
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:36,671
What was that?

117
00:08:36,763 --> 00:08:41,888
Canyon crawler. Oh, ugh! And there's sure to be more.

118
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:44,319
Your arms... they're broken.

119
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:48,471
Without my arms, I got no bending. In other words...

120
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:51,913
...we're trapped in this canyon.

121
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:01,586
I thought the whole point of ditching our food...

122
00:09:01,661 --> 00:09:04,776
...was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like... canyon crawlers...

123
00:09:04,851 --> 00:09:10,102
It's the Zhangs! They took food down here, even after the guide told them not to!

124
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:13,965
What! If there's anyone who can't go without food for a day,...

125
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:16,039
...it's you pampered Gan Jins!

126
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:19,644
I hope you're happy. We're stuck in the canyon with no way out.

127
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:22,148
Why don't you thank yourself, food hider!

128
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:24,394
Look. Sticking together is the only way to...

129
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:27,385
I'm not walkin' another step with the likes of them.

130
00:09:27,476 --> 00:09:30,536
Now, there's something we can agree on.

131
00:09:30,607 --> 00:09:31,758
Any ideas?

132
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:34,878
No bending. We need to get out of this canyon.

133
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:40,461
I won't die down here! I won't become part of the food chain!

134
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,909
See? We're going to become part of the food chain because of you!

135
00:09:44,013 --> 00:09:47,363
Sure. Unjustly blame the Zhangs like you always do!

136
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:48,213
Gladly!

137
00:09:48,304 --> 00:09:51,602
Enough! I thought I could help you guys get along,...

138
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:55,442
...but I guess that's not going to happen.

139
00:09:55,675 --> 00:10:00,079
We should split up. Gan Jins on this side... and Zhangs on that side.

140
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,405
We'll travel in two separate lines.

141
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:12,943
Sokka, you go with the Zhangs. And Katara, you go with the Gan Jins.

142
00:10:13,038 --> 00:10:18,468
See if you can figure out why they hate each other so much.

143
00:10:34,641 --> 00:10:36,841
So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps?

144
00:10:36,938 --> 00:10:39,075
What for? It's the dry season.

145
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,476
Exactly!

146
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,431
Besides, we like to use the tarp as a blanket.

147
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:47,708
Finally, someone gets it.

148
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:54,534
You really think it'll rain?

149
00:10:54,626 --> 00:11:00,391
No, but you can never be too careful, right?

150
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,524
Would you care for some bread, Katara?

151
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:20,835
So it was you guys who had food!

152
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:25,067
Oh come now. You really think that tribe of thieves isn't smuggling food?

153
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:30,301
Why should my people go hungry when the sneaky Zhangs are stuffing their faces?

154
00:11:30,384 --> 00:11:36,377
Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it.

155
00:11:38,098 --> 00:11:41,647
So, why does your tribe hate the Zhang so much?

156
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:49,799
You seem like a smart girl, Katara. I bet you would enjoy hearing some history.

157
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:55,689
The patriarch of our tribe,...

158
00:11:55,789 --> 00:12:00,764
...Jin Wei, was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty,...

159
00:12:00,827 --> 00:12:10,026
...transporting our sacred orb from the Great Eastern Gate to the Great Western Gate.

160
00:12:11,711 --> 00:12:17,119
Taking the orb from the east to the west represents the sun's rising and setting.

161
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:21,383
It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual...

162
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:26,504
...but as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang!

163
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:32,116
A vermin, named Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy.

164
00:12:32,207 --> 00:12:39,397
That coward, Wei Jin, knocked Jin Wei to the ground and stole our sacred orb.

165
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:48,315
Our people have never forgotten. You can never trust a Zhang.

166
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:52,200
Care for some meat?

167
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:54,197
Would I!?

168
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,773
I know what you must be thinking.

169
00:12:55,866 --> 00:13:00,332
We're horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here.

170
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:04,435
The Gan Jin think so badly of us they probably assumed we brought food in...

171
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,102
...and decided to bring food in themselves. That's why we brought food in.

172
00:13:09,196 --> 00:13:15,612
Our conflict with the Gan Jin goes back over a hundred years...

173
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,251
Our forefather, Wei Jin, was leaving the western gate of our village...

174
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:23,751
...when he saw a figure in the distance.

175
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:29,163
It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground.

176
00:13:29,254 --> 00:13:34,685
Noble Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb,...

177
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:39,243
...a very powerful relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual.

178
00:13:39,313 --> 00:13:41,380
Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds,...

179
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:44,683
...but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important,...

180
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:47,515
...and asked him to take it back to his tribe.

181
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,855
Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could,...

182
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:56,362
...but as Wei Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory...

183
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:58,704
...he was arrested!

184
00:14:02,106 --> 00:14:05,377
Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed,...

185
00:14:05,483 --> 00:14:09,737
...they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison.

186
00:14:10,318 --> 00:14:13,426
We Zhang's will never forget that injustice.

187
00:14:13,526 --> 00:14:18,826
That's just terrible. You gonna finish that?

188
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:22,074
Sure would be nice to be around one of those campfires,...

189
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:26,384
...telling stories and laughing. It's okay, Momo,...

190
00:14:26,489 --> 00:14:33,255
...we'll be out of here soon enough and then we can eat our weight in leechy nuts!

191
00:14:36,677 --> 00:14:39,733
Nah, I'll wait for the leechy nuts.

192
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:43,954
It's lonely, isn't it? Being impartial.

193
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,059
I wish I could help these people get along, but it just seems impossible.

194
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:51,007
Anyhow, I guess our biggest problem is getting out of here.

195
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:58,046
I'm not so sure the two problems are unrelated.

196
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:07,824
All clear! We're almost to the other side.

197
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:20,318
Katara, Sokka, will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon?

198
00:15:20,406 --> 00:15:24,066
I don't think so, Aang, the Zhang's really wronged the Gan Jins.

199
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:27,130
They ambushed Jin We and stole the sacred orb.

200
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,609
What are you talking about?

201
00:15:28,702 --> 00:15:30,823
Yeh, Katara, what are you talking about?

202
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:32,822
We Jin didn't steal the orb,...

203
00:15:32,904 --> 00:15:36,610
...he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.

204
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:39,145
Not punished enough if you ask me!

205
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:41,652
Okay! Okay! I get it! Now I need your help.

206
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:47,342
Let's get everyone together at the base of the canyon wall.

207
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:55,605
Please everyone! As soon as we get out of here we can eat,...

208
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:57,164
...and then go our separate ways,...

209
00:15:57,251 --> 00:16:00,859
...but I need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff.

210
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:05,129
Maybe the Zhang can climb the walls with their long, disgusting fingernails.

211
00:16:05,221 --> 00:16:08,159
Oh, sorry! I forgot that to the Gan Jin,...

212
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,299
...unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail!

213
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,823
Why you dirty thief!

214
00:16:13,917 --> 00:16:17,592
You pompous fool!

215
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:21,329
Guys! focus! How many times do I have to say it?

216
00:16:21,428 --> 00:16:25,445
Harsh words won't solve problems, action will!

217
00:16:25,537 --> 00:16:27,725
Perhaps the Avatar is right.

218
00:16:27,828 --> 00:16:31,427
Yes, perhaps he is.

219
00:16:32,054 --> 00:16:34,870
Harsh words will never solve our problems...

220
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,404
...action will!

221
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:47,706
To the death! And let this be the end of this rivalry!

222
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:53,706
You know, I take it back! Harsh words aren't so bad!

223
00:17:16,901 --> 00:17:22,483
Is that... food? Everyone smuggled food down here!? Unbelievable!

224
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:26,631
You guys put our lives in danger because you couldn't go without a snack for a day!?

225
00:17:26,719 --> 00:17:31,163
You are all... awful!

226
00:17:35,892 --> 00:17:43,825
So hungry... is that... egg custard in that tart?

227
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:53,945
Oh no! That's a lot of canyon crawlers!

228
00:17:54,048 --> 00:17:55,866
We barely survived one!

229
00:17:55,948 --> 00:18:01,181
They're coming back for me! They've had a taste, and they're coming back for me!

230
00:18:01,271 --> 00:18:06,864
Sokka, wait! I don't care about this stupid feud! I just want us to get out of here alive.

231
00:18:06,941 --> 00:18:12,135
Me too. I only took their side because they fed me.

232
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:17,121
Everybody! Watch me! Do what I do!

233
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:47,480
Now, follow me! We're riding out of this hole!

234
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:05,564
Everyone! Get off!

235
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,470
We made it!

236
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:25,404
I never thought a Gan Jin could get his hands dirty like that.

237
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:28,956
And I never knew you Zhang's were so reliable in a pinch.

238
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,976
Perhaps we're not so different after all.

239
00:20:33,047 --> 00:20:39,495
Too bad we can't rewrite history. You thieves stole our sacred orb from Jin Wei!

240
00:20:39,564 --> 00:20:45,158
You tyrants unjustly imprisoned We Jin for twenty long years!

241
00:20:45,257 --> 00:20:50,909
Wait a second! Jin Wei? Wei Jin? I know those guys!

242
00:20:50,963 --> 00:20:53,877
Yes, yes, we're all aware of the story.

243
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:59,417
No! I mean I really knew them. I may not look it, but I'm 112 years old.

244
00:20:59,496 --> 00:21:03,669
I was there a hundred years ago on the day you're talking about...

245
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:06,711
There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened.

246
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,933
First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies, they were brothers,...

247
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:15,726
...twins in fact and they were eight and most importantly,...

248
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:21,311
...they were just playing a game! The sacred orb from the legend... that was the ball.

249
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:24,353
And the eastern and western gates were the goal posts.

250
00:21:24,439 --> 00:21:28,329
Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it.

251
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,149
Win Jei didn't steal the ball,...

252
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:33,176
...he picked it up and started running it back toward the other goal.

253
00:21:33,255 --> 00:21:37,986
But he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box,...

254
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:42,774
...not for twenty long years, but for two short minutes.

255
00:21:42,849 --> 00:21:47,439
There was no stealing and no putting anyone in prison. Just a game.

256
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:50,351
You're saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball?

257
00:21:50,424 --> 00:21:52,520
Nope, just a regular ball.

258
00:21:52,589 --> 00:21:54,549
What about our tribe's redemption ritual?

259
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:57,137
That's what the game was called, Redemption.

260
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,884
As soon as someone got the ball from one goal to the other,...

261
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:04,168
...everyone would yell, "redemption!"

262
00:22:04,232 --> 00:22:05,061
Don't get me wrong,...

263
00:22:05,154 --> 00:22:09,457
...Wei Jin was kind of a slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true,...

264
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:14,051
...but they respected each others differences enough to share the same playing field.

265
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,348
I suppose it's time we forget the past...

266
00:22:17,401 --> 00:22:20,592
...and look to the future.

267
00:22:27,902 --> 00:22:31,455
Good to see ya, boy! Did you miss me?

268
00:22:31,526 --> 00:22:33,998
I cannot thank you enough, Avatar.

269
00:22:34,084 --> 00:22:38,461
Well, you know, I try.

270
00:22:38,547 --> 00:22:44,460
Let us travel to the Earth Kingdom capital as one tribe!

271
00:22:44,547 --> 00:22:48,686
I'm goin' too! I'm sick of this place!

272
00:22:48,783 --> 00:22:51,118
That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.

273
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:54,585
You could call it luck. Or, you could call it... lying!

274
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:55,433
What!?

275
00:22:55,501 --> 00:22:57,176
I made the whole thing up.

276
00:22:57,266 --> 00:23:01,136
You did not! That is so wrong.

277
00:23:01,221 --> 00:23:06,701
Now where's that custard tart? I'm starving!

We need you, Aang.

16
00:01:14,217 --> 00:01:17,051
I need you too.

17
00:01:21,758 --> 00:01:24,381
Be careful guys!

18
00:01:24,403 --> 00:01:26,797
Guys?

19
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:28,017
Gyatso?

20
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:30,704
Why did you disappear?

21
00:01:30,773 --> 00:01:33,999
I didn't mean to.

22
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:41,847
We need you, Aang.

23
00:01:45,578 --> 00:01:52,643
We need you, Aang. We need you.

24
00:01:52,714 --> 00:01:56,208
Huh? Uh... what's going on? Did we get captured again?

25
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:59,774
It's nothing, I just had a bad dream. Go back to sleep.

26
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,876
Don't have to tell me twice.

27
00:02:01,948 --> 00:02:03,204
Are you all right, Aang?

28
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:04,319
I'm okay.

29
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:08,089
You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately, you wanna tell me about it?

30
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:09,988
I think I just need some rest.

31
00:02:10,053 --> 00:02:13,430
You guys want to hear about my dream?

32
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:17,452
That's ok, I didn't wanna talk about it anyway.

33
00:02:21,029 --> 00:02:26,694
Look at those clear skies, buddy! Should be some smooth flying.

34
00:02:26,762 --> 00:02:31,126
Well, we better smoothly fly ourselves to a market, cause we're out of food.

35
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:34,630
Guys, wait, this was in my dream, we shouldn't go to the market.

36
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:36,331
What happened in your dream?

37
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:39,256
Food eats people!

38
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:45,551
Also, Momo could talk. You said some very unkind things.

39
00:02:50,726 --> 00:02:54,161
There is a storm coming. A big one.

40
00:02:54,247 --> 00:02:55,632
You're out of your mind, Uncle.

41
00:02:55,705 --> 00:02:58,644
The weather's perfect. There is not a cloud in sight.

42
00:02:58,731 --> 00:03:01,683
The storm is approaching from the north.

43
00:03:01,772 --> 00:03:05,716
I suggest we alter our course and head southwest.

44
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:09,611
We know the Avatar is traveling northward, so we will do the same.

45
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:12,928
Prince Zuko, consider the safety of the crew.

46
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:16,967
The safety of the crew doesn't matter!

47
00:03:18,268 --> 00:03:25,778
Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety.

48
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:32,041
He doesn't mean that, he's just all worked up.

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,415
Ah, it's good! It's perfect, I'm telling you!

50
00:03:38,503 --> 00:03:41,027
I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.

51
00:03:41,124 --> 00:03:46,371
Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices swishing around, eh?

52
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:49,406
I think it's true, Katara, swishing means it's ripe.

53
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:53,626
I just realized we're out of money anyway.

54
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,397
Out of food and out of money, now what are we supposed to do?

55
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:03,435
You could get a job, smart guy.

56
00:04:03,501 --> 00:04:05,037
We shouldn't go out there!

57
00:04:05,105 --> 00:04:08,897
Please, the fish can wait. There's going to be a terrible storm.

58
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:11,602
Ahh, you're crazy! It's a nice day.

59
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:15,820
No clouds, no wind, no nothing, so quit you're naggin' woman.

60
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:18,581
Maybe we should find some shelter?

61
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:21,063
Are you kidding? Shelter from what?

62
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:25,091
My joints say there's going to be a storm! A bad one.

63
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:28,226
Well, it's your joints against my brain.

64
00:04:28,298 --> 00:04:31,995
Then I hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish, cause I ain't comin!

65
00:04:32,075 --> 00:04:36,840
Then I'll find a new fish hauler and pay him double what you get! How do you like that?

66
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:37,826
I'll go!

67
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,517
You're hired!

68
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:43,993
What? You said... get a job' and he's paying double.

69
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,350
Double? Who told ya that nonsense?

70
00:04:52,147 --> 00:04:56,017
Uh! Looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all.

71
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:57,088
Lucky guess.

72
00:04:57,175 --> 00:05:03,259
Lieutenant, you'd better learn some respect, or I will teach it to you.

73
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:09,955
What do you know about respect? The way you talk to everyone around here,...

74
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,907
...from your hard working crew to your esteemed uncle...

75
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:19,149
...shows you know nothing about respect. You don't care about anyone but yourself!

76
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:26,250
Then again, what should I expect from a spoiled prince?

77
00:05:27,177 --> 00:05:30,127
Easy now.

78
00:05:32,329 --> 00:05:37,950
Enough! We are all a bit tired from being at sea so long.

79
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:46,033
I'm sure after a bowl of noodles everyone will feel much better.

80
00:05:46,109 --> 00:05:51,291
I don't need your help keeping order on my ship.

81
00:05:57,283 --> 00:06:01,108
Sokka, maybe this isn't such a good idea. Look at the sky.

82
00:06:01,172 --> 00:06:06,135
I said I was gonna do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather.

83
00:06:06,212 --> 00:06:10,439
The boy with the tattoos has some sense. You should listen to him!

84
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:14,806
Boy with tattoos? Airbender tattoos...

85
00:06:14,885 --> 00:06:19,110
...well I'll be a hogmonkey's uncle! You're the Avatar, ain't ya?

86
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,282
That's right.

87
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:26,158
Well don't be so smiley about it. The Avatar disappeared for a hundred years.

88
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,413
You turned your back on the world!

89
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:32,329
Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone!

90
00:06:32,407 --> 00:06:34,497
Oh? He wouldn't, uh?

91
00:06:34,576 --> 00:06:39,907
Then I guess I must have imagined the last hundred years of war and suffering.

92
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:42,284
Aang is the bravest person I know!

93
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:46,431
He has done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him.

94
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:54,255
It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang? Aang? What's wrong?

95
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,239
That's right! Keep flyin!

96
00:06:56,333 --> 00:07:00,528
You're a horrible old man!

97
00:07:02,472 --> 00:07:05,040
Appa, yip! Yip!

98
00:07:05,131 --> 00:07:07,615
Hey, they left without saying goodbye!

99
00:07:07,698 --> 00:07:09,844
You're friends ain't too polite, are they?

100
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:11,753
I know! This one time I was...

101
00:07:11,808 --> 00:07:15,455
Yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh, get below deck.

102
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:34,974
I'm sorry for running away.

103
00:07:35,049 --> 00:07:38,435
It's ok. That fisherman was way out of line.

104
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:40,448
Actually, he wasn't.

105
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:43,145
What do you mean?

106
00:07:43,218 --> 00:07:44,726
I don't wanna talk about it.

107
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,721
It has to do with your dream, doesn't it?

108
00:07:47,813 --> 00:07:49,304
Talk to me.

109
00:07:49,398 --> 00:07:53,486
Well, it's kind of a long story.

110
00:07:57,522 --> 00:08:01,649
I'm gonna try to get a little fire going.

111
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:08,130
I'll never forget the day the monks told me I was the Avatar.

112
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:11,706
I was playing with some other kids just outside the south wall.

113
00:08:11,796 --> 00:08:14,494
I was trying to teach them how to do the air scooter...

114
00:08:14,566 --> 00:08:19,432
First, you form a ball. Then you gotta get on quick.

115
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:27,708
Okay! Here goes!

116
00:08:27,785 --> 00:08:30,286
Quick, get on!

117
00:08:33,131 --> 00:08:35,540
You kinda have to balance on it like it's a top.

118
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:37,332
Man, that's hard.

119
00:08:37,428 --> 00:08:39,092
Where'd ya learn that trick, Aang?

120
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:41,556
I made it up.

121
00:08:42,211 --> 00:08:48,581
Aang, come with us. We need to speak with you.

122
00:08:53,305 --> 00:08:54,949
How do you know it's me?

123
00:08:55,029 --> 00:09:03,557
We have known you were the Avatar for some time. Do you remember these?

124
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:08,052
Those were some of my favorite toys when I was little!

125
00:09:08,151 --> 00:09:11,623
You chose them from among thousands of toys, Aang.

126
00:09:11,706 --> 00:09:15,400
The toys you picked were the four Avatar relics.

127
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:20,810
These items belonged to Avatars past. Your own past lives.

128
00:09:20,882 --> 00:09:23,532
I just chose them because they seemed fun.

129
00:09:23,618 --> 00:09:26,532
You chose them because they were familiar.

130
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:31,140
Normally we would have told you of your identity when you turned to sixteen,...

131
00:09:31,218 --> 00:09:37,280
...but there are troubling signs, storm clouds are gathering.

132
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:40,804
I fear that war may be upon us, young Avatar.

133
00:09:40,895 --> 00:09:44,418
We need you, Aang.

134
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:54,503
I'm sick of taking his orders and I'm tired of chasing his Avatar!

135
00:09:54,592 --> 00:09:57,002
I mean who does Zuko think he is?

136
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:58,976
Do you really want to know?

137
00:09:59,078 --> 00:10:00,831
General Iroh! We were just...

138
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:04,061
It's ok. May I join you?

139
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,650
Of course, Sir!

140
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:13,839
Try to understand, my nephew is a complicated young man.

141
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,299
He has been through much...

142
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,820
Let me in!

143
00:10:22,906 --> 00:10:24,835
Prince Zuko, what's wrong?

144
00:10:24,922 --> 00:10:28,031
I want to go into the war chamber, but the guard won't let me pass!

145
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:33,930
You're not missing anything, trust me. These meetings are dreadfully boring.

146
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:35,882
If I'm gonna rule this nation one day,...

147
00:10:35,963 --> 00:10:39,335
...don't you think I need to start learning as much as I can?

148
00:10:39,403 --> 00:10:43,360
Very well. But you must promise not to speak.

149
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,304
These old folks are a bit sensitive, you know.

150
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:48,897
Thank you uncle!

151
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:57,864
The Earth Kingdom defenses are concentrated here.

152
00:10:57,955 --> 00:11:02,623
A dangerous battalion of their strongest earthbenders and fiercest warriors,...

153
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:05,783
...so I am recommending the 41st division.

154
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:08,871
But the 41st is entirely new recruits.

155
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:12,993
How do you expect them to defeat a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?

156
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:19,359
I don't. They'll be used as a distraction while we mount an attack from the rear.

157
00:11:19,421 --> 00:11:23,085
What better to use as bait then fresh meat?

158
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:25,664
You can't sacrifice an entire division like that!

159
00:11:25,729 --> 00:11:32,288
Those soldiers love and defend our nation! How can you betray them?

160
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:37,218
Zuko was right, you see, but it was not his place to speak out,...

161
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:42,283
...and there were... dire consequences.

162
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:47,921
So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it?

163
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:50,859
Well, I didn't know how to feel about it.

164
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:55,591
All I knew is that after I found out, everything began changing...

165
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,634
Hey, not bad! You guys have been practicing!

166
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:03,006
Not only that, we made up a game you can play with the air scooters!

167
00:12:03,092 --> 00:12:05,284
Great!

168
00:12:09,044 --> 00:12:10,292
What's going on?

169
00:12:10,378 --> 00:12:11,559
Now that you're the Avatar,...

170
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:15,592
...it's kind of an unfair advantage for whichever team you're on.

171
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:21,555
But I'm still the same... nothing's changed. So, what, I can't play?

172
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:23,487
That's the only fair way.

173
00:12:23,555 --> 00:12:26,151
Oh, ok.

174
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:28,984
Sorry, Aang.

175
00:12:29,063 --> 00:12:34,659
Okay, now who wants to have Jinju on their team?

176
00:12:41,603 --> 00:12:44,585
Very interesting move, young one.

177
00:12:44,676 --> 00:12:47,237
What do you mean?

178
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:53,333
Hey!

179
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:59,778
You're playing games with him? The Avatar should be training.

180
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,603
Aang has already trained enough for today.

181
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:08,161
Time is short. Come with me. I must test you on some high level techniques.

182
00:13:08,252 --> 00:13:10,569
No, as long as I am his guardian,...

183
00:13:10,656 --> 00:13:18,544
...I will decide when he trains and when he gets his butt kicked at Pai Sho.

184
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:31,415
After Zuko's outburst in the meeting, the Fire Lord became very angry with him.

185
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:36,514
He said that Prince Zuko's challenge of the general was an act of complete...

186
00:13:36,587 --> 00:13:42,317
...disrespect, and there was only one way to resolve this...

187
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:45,140
Agni kai. A fire duel.

188
00:13:45,212 --> 00:13:46,790
That's right.

189
00:13:46,847 --> 00:13:53,532
Zuko looked upon the old general he had insulted and declared that he was not afraid.

190
00:13:53,623 --> 00:13:58,630
But Zuko misunderstood. When he turned to face his opponent,...

191
00:13:58,697 --> 00:14:02,389
...he was surprised to see it was not the General.

192
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:06,040
Zuko had spoken out against a general's plan,...

193
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:09,225
...but by doing so in the Fire Lord's war room,...

194
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:14,149
...it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected.

195
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:20,295
Zuko would have to duel his own father.

196
00:14:20,367 --> 00:14:24,921
Then, just when I was starting to feel better, something worse happened.

197
00:14:25,003 --> 00:14:31,079
Aang needs to have freedom and fun. He needs to grow up as a normal boy.

198
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:34,794
Humph! You cannot keep protecting him from his destiny.

199
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:37,470
Gyatso, I know you mean well,...

200
00:14:37,572 --> 00:14:41,335
...but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment.

201
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:45,319
All I want is what is best for him.

202
00:14:45,424 --> 00:14:54,173
But what we need is what's best for the world. You and Aang must be separated.

203
00:14:54,271 --> 00:15:01,460
The Avatar will be sent away to the Eastern Air Temple to complete his training.

204
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:12,631
That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say.

205
00:15:12,701 --> 00:15:14,136
How could they do that to me!

206
00:15:14,207 --> 00:15:17,746
They wanted to take away everything I knew and everyone I loved!

207
00:15:17,825 --> 00:15:20,846
Whoa! Hot cinders!

208
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:23,165
I'm sorry I got so mad.

209
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:26,464
You have a right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that.

210
00:15:26,538 --> 00:15:31,001
Well, that's not exactly what happened...

211
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,562
I was afraid and confused. I didn't know what to do.

212
00:15:44,677 --> 00:15:53,176
Aang, I'm not going to let them take you away from me. Aang?

213
00:15:58,622 --> 00:16:02,046
I never saw Gyatso again.

214
00:16:16,664 --> 00:16:23,310
Next thing I knew, I was waking up in your arms after you found me in the iceberg.

215
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,795
You ran away.

216
00:16:25,872 --> 00:16:28,298
And then the Fire Nation attacked our temple.

217
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:30,773
My people needed me and I wasn't there to help.

218
00:16:30,848 --> 00:16:31,761
You don't know what would've...

219
00:16:31,856 --> 00:16:34,484
The world needed me and I wasn't there to help.

220
00:16:34,579 --> 00:16:35,345
Aang...

221
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:38,776
The fisherman was right! I did turn my back on the world.

222
00:16:38,852 --> 00:16:40,634
You're being too hard on yourself.

223
00:16:40,705 --> 00:16:44,714
Even if you did run away, I think it was meant to be.

224
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,313
If you had stayed you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders.

225
00:16:48,393 --> 00:16:49,532
You don't know that.

226
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:59,548
I know it's meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.

227
00:17:02,623 --> 00:17:07,841
When Prince Zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him,...

228
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:11,144
...he begged for mercy...

229
00:17:11,223 --> 00:17:14,789
Please, father, I only had the fire nation's best interest at heart!

230
00:17:14,887 --> 00:17:16,715
I'm sorry I spoke out of turn!

231
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:20,034
You will fight for your honor.

232
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:23,676
I meant you no disrespect. I am your loyal son.

233
00:17:23,764 --> 00:17:26,750
Rise and fight, Prince Zuko!

234
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:28,534
I won't fight you.

235
00:17:28,636 --> 00:17:36,494
You will learn respect, and suffering will be your teacher.

236
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:39,413
I looked away.

237
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:48,489
I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident...

238
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:51,241
It was no accident.

239
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:57,192
After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight,...

240
00:17:57,276 --> 00:18:00,771
...Zuko had shown shameful weakness.

241
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:06,506
As punishment he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar.

242
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:10,372
Only then could he return with his honor.

243
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:13,403
So that's why he's so obsessed.

244
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,492
Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal.

245
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:21,266
Things will never return to normal.

246
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:28,747
But the important thing is, the Avatar gives Zuko hope.

247
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:46,068
Help! Oh, please help!

248
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:47,847
It's ok, you're safe.

249
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:49,594
But, my husband isn't.

250
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:52,131
What do you mean? Where's Sokka?

251
00:18:52,195 --> 00:18:55,235
They haven't returned. They should've been back by now,...

252
00:18:55,292 --> 00:18:59,691
...and this storm is becoming a typhoon. They're caught out at sea.

253
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:01,207
I'm going to find them.

254
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,413
I'm going with you.

255
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:04,967
I'm staying here!

256
00:19:06,467 --> 00:19:10,160
We'll be back soon, I promise.

257
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:16,536
Where were we hit?

258
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:17,807
I don't know!

259
00:19:17,892 --> 00:19:19,907
Look!

260
00:19:20,266 --> 00:19:23,039
The helmsman!

261
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:52,616
Where are they?

262
00:19:54,273 --> 00:19:56,821
Come on, Appa!

263
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,874
The boat! It's there!

264
00:20:11,631 --> 00:20:12,900
The Avatar!

265
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,814
What do you want to do, Sir?

266
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:19,536
Let him go. We need to get this ship to safety.

267
00:20:19,612 --> 00:20:25,890
Then we must head directly into the eye of the storm.

268
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:33,986
I'm too young to die!

269
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:37,872
I'm not, but I still don't wanna!

270
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:54,269
Hang on to the rope!

271
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:47,930
Uncle, I am sorry.

272
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,219
Your apology is accepted.

273
00:22:11,047 --> 00:22:15,667
Oh, you're alive! You owe this boy an apology.

274
00:22:15,763 --> 00:22:17,552
He doesn't have to apologize.

275
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:23,271
Mmm, uh, what if instead of an apology I give him a free fish and we call it even?

276
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:25,161
Actually, I don't eat meat.

277
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:26,724
Fish ain't meat.

278
00:22:26,802 --> 00:22:31,229
Seriously, you're still gonna pay me, right?

279
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:35,403
Katara, I think you were right before. I'm done dwelling on the past.

280
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,281
Really?

281
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:40,367
I can't make guesses about how things would have turned out if I hadn't run away.

282
00:22:40,433 --> 00:22:42,615
I'm here now and I'm going to make the most of it.

283
00:22:42,663 --> 00:22:45,422
I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore.

284
00:22:45,501 --> 00:22:50,405
Uh, if you weren't here now, well, I guess I wouldn't be either.

285
00:22:50,493 --> 00:22:55,011
Thank you for saving my life, Avatar.

286
00:22:55,117 --> 00:23:00,180
Do you hear that? It's stopped raining.

287
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,388
Appa!

00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:21,988

11
00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,356

12
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:37,089
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,712

Book One: Water
Chapter Thirteen: The Blue Spirit

15
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,449
Absolutely not.
The Yu Yan archers stay here.

16
00:01:18,538 --> 00:01:21,714
Your request is denied Commander Zhao.

17
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:27,376
Colonel Shinu, please reconsider. Their precision is legendary.

18
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:34,313
The Yu Yan can pin a fly to a tree from a hundred yards away... without killing it.

19
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:38,150
You're wasting their talents using them as mere security guards.

20
00:01:38,203 --> 00:01:43,881
I can do whatever I want with their talents. They're my archers and what I say goes.

21
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,760
But my search for the Avatar is...

22
00:01:45,835 --> 00:01:48,499
...Is nothing but a vanity project!

23
00:01:48,584 --> 00:01:53,288
We're fighting a real war here and I need every man I've got, Commander.

24
00:01:53,343 --> 00:01:53,892
But...

25
00:01:53,968 --> 00:02:00,067
That's final! I don't want to hear another word about it.

26
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:12,131
News from Fire Lord Ozai?

27
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:21,154
It appears I've been promoted to Admiral. My request is now an order.

28
00:02:39,932 --> 00:02:42,664
This should bring your fever down.

29
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:47,287
You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor.

30
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:50,608
That's nice. I'll tell him.

31
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:53,946
Classic Appa.

32
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:55,148
How's Sokka doing?

33
00:02:55,221 --> 00:03:01,550
Not so good. Being out in that storm really did a number on him.

34
00:03:02,412 --> 00:03:06,123
I couldn't find any ginger root for the tea, but I found a map.

35
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:08,877
There's an herbalist institute on the top of that mountain.

36
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,149
We could probably find a cure for Sokka there.

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,416
Aang, he's in no condition to travel. Sokka just needs more rest.

38
00:03:15,475 --> 00:03:19,375
I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.

39
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,100
Not you too!

40
00:03:23,173 --> 00:03:28,439
Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fine...

41
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,780
That's how Sokka started yesterday.

42
00:03:34,848 --> 00:03:37,598
Now look at him... he thinks he's an earthbender!

43
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:40,779
Take that, you rock!

44
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:43,591
A few more hours and you'll be talking nonsense too.

45
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:46,456
I'm going to find some medicine.

46
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:59,702
Uh, maybe it's safer if I go on foot. Keep an eye on 'em guys.

47
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,327
You guys are killin' me!

48
00:04:13,902 --> 00:04:17,367
We haven't been able to pick up the Avatar's trail since the storm.

49
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:21,584
But, if we continue heading northeast...

50
00:04:21,653 --> 00:04:23,131
What do they want?

51
00:04:23,184 --> 00:04:28,333
Perhaps a sporting game of Pai Sho!

52
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,482
The hunt for the Avatar has been given prime importance.

53
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:38,944
All information regarding the Avatar must be reported directly to Admiral Zhao.

54
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:43,923
Zhao has been promoted? Well, good for him!

55
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:49,291
I've got nothing to report to Zhao. Now get off my ship and let us pass.

56
00:04:49,349 --> 00:04:53,402
Admiral Zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area.

57
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:56,000
Off my ship!

58
00:04:56,067 --> 00:05:02,387
Excellent! I take the pot. But, you're all improving.

59
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:07,460
I'm certain you will win if we play again.

60
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:16,075
Says here that the Avatar can create tornados and run faster than the wind.

61
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:17,217
Pretty amazing.

62
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:25,075
Ehh, that's just a bunch of Fire Lord propaganda. There's no way that's true.

63
00:05:37,312 --> 00:05:40,897
Katara... please... water...

64
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:50,691
Listen carefully, Momo. I need you to take this to the river and fill it with water.

65
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,674
Got it?

66
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:17,255
Hello! I'm sorry to barge in like this, but I need some medicine for my friends.

67
00:06:17,318 --> 00:06:18,751
They have fevers and they've been coughing and...

68
00:06:18,817 --> 00:06:24,134
Settle down, young man. Your friends are going to be fine.

69
00:06:24,194 --> 00:06:29,423
I've been up here for over fourty years you know, used to be others,...

70
00:06:29,485 --> 00:06:35,638
...but they all left years ago. Now it's just me and Miyuki.

71
00:06:35,723 --> 00:06:36,663
That's nice.

72
00:06:36,725 --> 00:06:42,585
Wounded Earth Kingdom troops still come by now and again, brave boys,...

73
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:48,541
...and thanks to my remedies they always leave in better shape they when they arrive.

74
00:06:48,622 --> 00:06:50,544
That's nice. Are you almost done?

75
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:55,219
Hold on, I just need to add one last ingredient.

76
00:06:55,281 --> 00:07:01,148
Oh, sandalwood... oh, er, uh, that won't do, banana leaf?

77
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:09,386
Ah, nope, uh, ginger root, uh uh, oh where is that pesky little plant?

78
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,980
Is everything okay? It's been almost an hour and you haven't given the men an order.

79
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:22,666
I don't care what they do.

80
00:07:22,736 --> 00:07:27,624
Don't give up hope yet. You can still find the Avatar before Zhao.

81
00:07:27,706 --> 00:07:28,730
How, Uncle?

82
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:33,221
With Zhao's resources it's just a matter of time before he captures the Avatar.

83
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:40,526
My honor, my throne, my country, I'm about to lose them all.

84
00:07:40,774 --> 00:07:46,798
Oh, here's what I was looking for! Plum blossom!

85
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:48,417
Finally!

86
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:49,454
Thanks for all your help!

87
00:07:49,546 --> 00:07:52,362
Hands off! What do you think you're doing?

88
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:55,292
Taking the cure to my friends!

89
00:07:55,353 --> 00:07:58,707
This isn't a cure, it's Miyuki's dinner.

90
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:01,282
Plum blossom is her favorite.

91
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:02,887
What about my friends?

92
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:06,476
Well, all they need is some frozen wood frogs.

93
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:09,154
There's plenty of them down in the valley swamp.

94
00:08:09,236 --> 00:08:11,607
What am I supposed to do with frozen frogs?

95
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:14,078
Why, suck on them of course!

96
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,406
Suck on them!?

97
00:08:15,492 --> 00:08:19,725
The frog's skin excretes a substance that'll cure your friends,...

98
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:26,950
...but make sure you get plenty. Once those little critters thaw out, they're useless!

99
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,446
You're insane aren't you?

100
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:31,449
Thaaat's right.

101
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:37,309
Well, don't stand there all day. Go!

102
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:56,542
Uhh, I think you dropped this.

103
00:09:47,762 --> 00:09:50,429
A frog!

104
00:10:28,956 --> 00:10:34,710
So this is the great Avatar? Master of all the elements.

105
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:39,329
I don't know how you've managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years,...

106
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:43,132
...but your little game of hide and seek is over.

107
00:10:43,187 --> 00:10:47,007
I've never hidden from you. Untie me and I'll fight you right now!

108
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:54,134
Uhh, no. Tell me, how does it feel to be the only airbender left?

109
00:10:54,174 --> 00:10:57,511
Do you miss your people?

110
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,702
Oh, don't worry, you won't be killed like they were.

111
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,581
See, if you die you'll just be reborn...

112
00:11:03,652 --> 00:11:08,300
...and the Fire Nation will have to being its search for the Avatar all over again.

113
00:11:08,362 --> 00:11:14,874
So, I'll keep you alive... but just barely.

114
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,905
Blow all the wind you want! Your situation is futile.

115
00:11:22,978 --> 00:11:31,715
There is no escaping this fortress... and no one is coming to rescue you.

116
00:11:35,808 --> 00:11:36,807
Water...

117
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:41,743
Momo should be back any minute.

118
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:51,717
Ugh! No, Momo, water. Wa-ter!

119
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:58,491
Aang, what in the world is taking you so long?

120
00:12:30,471 --> 00:12:33,097
All clear.

121
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:47,431
All clear. Go on in.

122
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:12,095
We are the sons and daughters of fire! The superior element!

123
00:13:12,155 --> 00:13:16,567
Until today, only one thing stood in our path to victory.

124
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:25,690
The Avatar! I am here to tell you that he is now my prisoner!

125
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:32,622
This is the year Sozen's comet returns to grant us its power!

126
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:37,674
This is the year the Fire Nation breaks through the walls of Ba Sing Se...

127
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:42,847
...and burns the city to the ground!

128
00:13:59,268 --> 00:14:03,861
What? No! Don't leave frogs! My friends are sick and they need you!

129
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,322
Please go back to being frozen!

130
00:15:19,609 --> 00:15:26,353
Who are you? What's going on? Are you here to rescue me?

131
00:15:26,404 --> 00:15:29,952
I'll take that as a "yes."

132
00:15:34,397 --> 00:15:39,334
My frogs! Come back! And stop thawing out!

133
00:15:39,413 --> 00:15:45,141
Wait! My friends need to suck on those frogs!

134
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:57,200
How many times do I have to tell you, Momo, we need water. Wa-ter.

135
00:15:57,238 --> 00:16:01,578
Oh forget it. Aang, please, hurry.

136
00:16:01,647 --> 00:16:07,748
Who's this "Aang" kid you keep talking about, Your Highness?

137
00:16:32,113 --> 00:16:36,161
I want a full transcription of my speech sent to the Fire Lord,...

138
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:43,761
...along with glowing testimonials from all of the ranking officers present, and...

139
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:58,440
Sir, should I hold off sending that speech to the Fire Lord?

140
00:17:04,304 --> 00:17:07,485
There, on the wall!

141
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,861
The Avatar has escaped! Close all the gates immediately!

142
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:21,242
Stay close to me!

143
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,240
Take this. Jump on my back!

144
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:57,916
Gimme the next one!

145
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:20,774
Hold your fire! The Avatar must be captured alive!

146
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,539
Open the gate.

147
00:19:26,578 --> 00:19:28,340
Admiral, what are you doing?

148
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:33,032
Let them out, now!

149
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,510
How could you let them go?

150
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:42,049
A situation like this requires... precision.

151
00:19:54,769 --> 00:19:58,318
Do you have a clear shot?

152
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:06,406
Knock out the thief. I'll deliver him to the Fire Lord along with the Avatar.

153
00:20:19,246 --> 00:20:22,353
Quick! Recover the Avatar!

154
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:09,507
You know what the worst part about being born over a hundred years ago is?

155
00:21:09,566 --> 00:21:12,230
I miss all the friends I used to hang out with.

156
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:16,012
Before the war started, I used to always my friend Kuzan.

157
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:20,547
The two of us, we'd get in and out of so much trouble together.

158
00:21:20,617 --> 00:21:23,309
He was one of the best friends I ever had...

159
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,731
...and he was from the Fire Nation, just like you.

160
00:21:26,805 --> 00:21:32,765
If we knew each other back then, do you think we could have been friends too?

161
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:54,493
Where have you been, Prince Zuko?

162
00:21:54,572 --> 00:22:00,511
You missed music night! Lieutenant Jee sang a stirring love song.

163
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:05,804
I'm going to bed. No disturbances.

164
00:22:15,506 --> 00:22:19,957
Suck on these. They'll make you feel better.

165
00:22:20,905 --> 00:22:25,646
Aang, how was your trip? Did you make any new friends?

166
00:22:25,698 --> 00:22:29,881
No, I don't think I did.

167
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:49,614
This is tasty!

00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water
Chapter Fourteen: The Fortuneteller

15
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:55,435
Look!

16
00:01:01,216 --> 00:01:07,521
He is taunting us. You are so gonna be dinner!

17
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:09,763
Hey! Where's the fishing line?

18
00:01:09,823 --> 00:01:13,202
Oh, I didn't think you would need it, Sokka.

19
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:15,642
Aahh, it's all tangled!

20
00:01:15,692 --> 00:01:19,660
Not tangled... woven. I made you a necklace, Katara.

21
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,240
I thought since you lost your other one...

22
00:01:25,237 --> 00:01:27,564
Thanks, Aang. I love it.

23
00:01:27,622 --> 00:01:28,721
Great, Aang.

24
00:01:28,777 --> 00:01:32,383
Maybe instead of saving the world you can go into the jewelry making business.

25
00:01:32,435 --> 00:01:36,063
I don't see why I can't do both.

26
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,591
Stop taunting me!

27
00:01:42,784 --> 00:01:45,951
So, how do I look?

28
00:01:50,042 --> 00:01:54,498
You mean all of you or just your neck? I mean, uh, both look great.

29
00:01:54,554 --> 00:01:59,113
Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love.

30
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:01,050
I... well...

31
00:02:01,127 --> 00:02:07,856
Stop teasing him, Sokka. Aang's just a good friend. A sweet little guy... just like Momo.

32
00:02:07,908 --> 00:02:09,644
Thanks.

33
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:19,052
Someone's being attacked by a platypus bear!

34
00:02:28,853 --> 00:02:32,470
Well, hello there. Nice day, isn't it?

35
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,074
Make noise, it'll run off!

36
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:36,481
No, play dead, he'll lose interest!

37
00:02:36,499 --> 00:02:39,748
Whoa! Close one.

38
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:41,746
Run down hill, then climb a tree!

39
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,273
No, punch him in the bill!

40
00:02:43,324 --> 00:02:45,488
And then run in zigzags!

41
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:50,052
No need. It's going to be fine.

42
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:57,668
Whoa there!

43
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,400
Mmm! Lunch! Lucky for you we came along.

44
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:15,285
Thanks, but everything was already under control.

45
00:03:15,358 --> 00:03:19,975
Not to worry, Aunt Wu predicted I'd have a safe journey.

46
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:20,916
Aunt who?

47
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:28,401
No, Aunt Wu. She's the fortuneteller from my village. Awful nice knowing your future.

48
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:32,620
Wow, it must be. That explains why you were so calm.

49
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:34,796
But the fortuneteller was wrong!

50
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,663
You didn't have a safe journey, you were almost killed!

51
00:03:37,703 --> 00:03:43,468
But I wasn't. All right, have a good one!

52
00:03:43,526 --> 00:03:50,619
Oh, and Aunt Wu said if I met any travelers to give them this.

53
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,394
Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun.

54
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:59,608
Oh come on, fortunetelling is nonsense.

55
00:03:59,653 --> 00:04:03,846
What do ya know, an umbrella!

56
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:05,201
That proves it.

57
00:04:05,241 --> 00:04:08,781
No it doesn't... you can't really tell the future.

58
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:13,766
I guess you're not really getting wet then.

59
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:18,476
Of course she predicted it was gonna rain. The sky's been gray all day.

60
00:04:18,554 --> 00:04:22,658
Just admit you might be wrong and you can come under the umbrella.

61
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:28,747
Look, I'm going to predict the future now... "It's going to keep drizzling."

62
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:30,852
See!

63
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:35,813
Not everyone has the gift, Sokka.

64
00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:56,628
Aunt Wu is expecting you.

65
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:58,672
Really?

66
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:09,618
My name is Meng and I'm Aunt Wu's assistant.

67
00:05:12,182 --> 00:05:14,977
Well hello there.

68
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:16,115
Hello.

69
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:20,498
Can I get you some tea, or some of Aunt Wu's special bean curd puffs?

70
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:21,848
I'll try a curd puff.

71
00:05:21,893 --> 00:05:24,464
Just a second. So what's your name?

72
00:05:24,523 --> 00:05:25,647
Aang.

73
00:05:25,724 --> 00:05:31,575
That rhymes with Meng! And you've got some pretty big ears, don't you?

74
00:05:31,656 --> 00:05:33,249
I... guess...

75
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,916
Oh, don't be modest. They're huge!

76
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:40,171
Well Aang, it is very nice to meet you. Very nice.

77
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:42,183
Likewise.

78
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:45,165
I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense.

79
00:05:45,192 --> 00:05:47,478
Try to keep an open mind, Sokka.

80
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:50,286
There are things in this world that just can't be explained.

81
00:05:50,322 --> 00:05:53,007
Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?

82
00:05:53,049 --> 00:05:57,403
It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.

83
00:05:57,457 --> 00:06:02,262
Oh Meng! Aunt Wu says I'm going to meet my true love!

84
00:06:02,307 --> 00:06:05,351
He's going to give me a rare panda lilly.

85
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:12,225
That's so romantic. I wonder if my true love will give me a rare flower.

86
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:14,203
Good luck with that!

87
00:06:14,269 --> 00:06:20,290
Is that the big eared guy who Aunt Wu predicted you'd marry?

88
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:30,105
Enjoy your snack.

89
00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:37,920
Welcome young travelers. Now, who's next? Don't be shy.

90
00:06:39,027 --> 00:06:42,017
I guess that's me.

91
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,034
Not bad. Not bad.

92
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:50,893
I'm good on puffs.

93
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:54,777
So... what do you think they're talking about back there?

94
00:06:54,837 --> 00:06:56,888
Boring stuff, I'm sure. Love.

95
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:59,818
Who she's going to marry. How many babies she's gonna have.

96
00:06:59,888 --> 00:07:06,270
Yeh... dumb stuff like that... well, I've gotta find a bathroom!

97
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:13,868
Your palms are so smooth... do you use moisturizer?

98
00:07:13,914 --> 00:07:19,099
Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I could get you some if you want.

99
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,443
So, do you see anything interesting in my love line?

100
00:07:22,477 --> 00:07:27,594
I feel great romance for you. The man you're going to marry...

101
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:28,761
Tell me more!

102
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:35,394
I can see that he is a very powerful bender.

103
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:43,544
Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.

104
00:07:43,616 --> 00:07:45,494
Yeh, when I was in there...

105
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:46,788
I don't even wanna know!

106
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:48,124
Who's next?

107
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:50,337
Okay, let's get this over with.

108
00:07:50,381 --> 00:07:56,948
Your future is full of struggle and anguish, most of it self-inflicted.

109
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:59,267
But, you didn't read my palms or anything!

110
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:05,377
I don't need to... it's written all over your face.

111
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:09,554
You then, come with me.

112
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:16,069
This is the most reliable method of telling your fortune. The bones never lie.

113
00:08:16,115 --> 00:08:19,830
Go on, pick one.

114
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,723
Now throw it on the fire.

115
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:30,041
The heat makes cracks in the bones and I read the bone cracks to tell your destiny.

116
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:33,423
Wow, that's a big crack.

117
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:37,372
I've never seen this before.

118
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,477
Oh my!

119
00:08:45,169 --> 00:08:52,004
The old destiny, this is incredible! You will be involved in a great battle,...

120
00:08:52,061 --> 00:08:55,769
...an awesome conflict between the forces of good and evil,...

121
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,575
...a battle whose outcome will determine the fate of the whole world!

122
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:04,430
Yeh, yeh, I knew that already, but did it say anything about a girl?

123
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,559
A girl? You want to know about love?

124
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:08,735
Yes!

125
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:13,561
I'm sorry, but I didn't see anything.

126
00:09:13,606 --> 00:09:17,325
Oh look! I must have missed something.

127
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:24,106
Right here... it says, "trust your heart and you will be with the one you love."

128
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:28,163
Really!? Thank you, Aunt Wu!

129
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:33,812
Well, now you got to see for yourselves that fortunetelling is just a big, stupid hoax.

130
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,434
You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.

131
00:09:37,483 --> 00:09:44,329
That woman is crazy! My life will be calm, and happy and joyful!

132
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:47,746
That doesn't prove anything!

133
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:52,663
Well, I liked my predictions. Certain things are going to turn out very well.

134
00:09:52,736 --> 00:09:54,582
They sure are.

135
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:56,823
Why, what did she tell you?

136
00:09:56,871 --> 00:10:00,780
Some stuff. You'll find out.

137
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,141
What's with the sky?

138
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:08,871
We are waiting for Aunt Wu to come and read the clouds...

139
00:10:08,937 --> 00:10:10,899
...to predict the fate of the whole village.

140
00:10:10,962 --> 00:10:13,597
That cloud looks like a fluffy bunny.

141
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:15,563
You better hope that's not a bunny...

142
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:19,142
...the fluffy bunny cloud forecasts doom and destruction.

143
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:21,119
Do you even hear yourself?

144
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,416
The cloud reading will tell us if Mount Makapu...

145
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:26,980
...will remain dormant for another year or if it will erupt.

146
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,228
We used to have a tradition once a year of going up the mountain...

147
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:35,022
...to check the volcano ourselves, but ever since Aunt Wu moved to the village...

148
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:39,852
...twenty years ago we have a tradition of not doing that.

149
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:44,262
I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy old woman's superstition.

150
00:10:44,296 --> 00:10:47,322
Shhhh!! She's coming!

151
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:54,420
Hey Aang, doesn't that cloud look like a flower?

152
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:58,059
Huh? Sure, I guess.

153
00:10:58,108 --> 00:11:00,957
Hey Katara, don't you think that cloud looks like a flower?

154
00:11:01,002 --> 00:11:03,229
Shh!!

155
00:11:08,491 --> 00:11:14,660
Bending arrow cloud... good crops this year, nice big harvest!

156
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:17,037
Arg! Good news!

157
00:11:17,075 --> 00:11:24,782
Wavy moon shape cloud... let's see? gonna be a great year for twins.

158
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:25,733
Yes!

159
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:30,981
And a cumulus cloud with a twisted nob coming off the end of it...

160
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:37,559
...the village will not be destroyed by the volcano this year!

161
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:41,608
Since I got you here, uh, there's something I want to tell you.

162
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:46,108
I like you, but more than normal.

163
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:48,823
Never mind.

164
00:11:53,936 --> 00:11:56,691
Hi, Aunt Wu. Sorry to bother you.

165
00:11:56,751 --> 00:11:57,630
Anytime.

166
00:11:57,678 --> 00:11:59,789
About this man I'm supposed to marry...

167
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:02,799
...is he gonna be handsome? Oh, I hope he's tall!

168
00:12:02,837 --> 00:12:06,072
Ahh, you want another reading.

169
00:12:06,123 --> 00:12:08,625
Yes, please!

170
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:14,910
I can't believe all these saps. Someone really needs to scream some sense at them.

171
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:16,757
They seem happy, Sokka.

172
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:21,351
Not for long. I'm gonna prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense.

173
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:25,259
Hey, you. I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she?

174
00:12:25,303 --> 00:12:28,940
Yeh, she said I'd be wearing red shoes when I met my true love.

175
00:12:28,987 --> 00:12:33,710
Uh-huh. And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?

176
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,593
Everyday.

177
00:12:35,623 --> 00:12:38,337
Then of course it's going to come true!

178
00:12:38,415 --> 00:12:43,670
Really? You think so? I'm so excited!

179
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:50,701
...and then you'll have your third great grandchild...

180
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:56,144
...before quietly passing away in your sleep. Is that enough information for you?

181
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:01,149
Wow, thanks Aunt Wu. Oh, wait, one more thing.

182
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,677
How warmly should I dress tomorrow?

183
00:13:03,746 --> 00:13:07,335
You want me to do a reading for that?

184
00:13:07,377 --> 00:13:14,159
I don't care what Aunt Wu told you, you have to take a bath sometime!

185
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:19,277
So, Sokka, you know some stuff about ladies, right?

186
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:24,106
Some stuff? You've come to the right place. What can I do you for?

187
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:27,471
Well, there's this girl...

188
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:29,894
I think I know who you mean.

189
00:13:29,951 --> 00:13:31,871
You do? And you're ok with it?

190
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,279
Of course I am. And, to tell you the truth,...

191
00:13:34,349 --> 00:13:36,896
...I've been picking up the subtle vibe that she likes you too.

192
00:13:36,975 --> 00:13:38,035
She does!?

193
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:42,697
Oh yeh, she's crazy about ya. All ya have to do now is not mess it up.

194
00:13:42,772 --> 00:13:44,316
Well, how do I do that?

195
00:13:44,384 --> 00:13:48,709
The number one mistake nice guys like you make being too nice.

196
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,124
You can be too nice?

197
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:54,135
Yup. If you want to keep her interested you have to act aloof,...

198
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:56,444
...like you don't really care one way or the other.

199
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,765
Well... okay.

200
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:01,329
Hey Aang, I was wondering...

201
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:04,130
See ya later.

202
00:14:04,226 --> 00:14:07,740
Wow, that kid is good.

203
00:14:07,729 --> 00:14:11,770
...and you'll be fine as long as you've got a scarf. Bye bye now.

204
00:14:11,821 --> 00:14:14,485
Okay, okay, but, one more thing.

205
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:16,770
All right, what is it?

206
00:14:16,819 --> 00:14:21,429
Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?

207
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,555
Papaya!

208
00:14:23,611 --> 00:14:26,028
Ohhh, I hate papaya.

209
00:14:26,094 --> 00:14:29,171
Oh, hey Katara. I didn't see you there.

210
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:31,012
Hey Aang.

211
00:14:31,098 --> 00:14:35,585
That's ok, I'm busy with my own stuff.

212
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:45,267
Ugh. Papaya please.

213
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:47,532
So... papaya.

214
00:14:47,576 --> 00:14:49,669
Uh-huh. Would you like some?

215
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:53,280
You know me. I don't really care what I eat.

216
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:56,700
Ok then. See you later.

217
00:14:57,427 --> 00:14:59,406
Maybe aloof isn't my style.

218
00:14:59,429 --> 00:15:03,320
Oh! A panda lilly!

219
00:15:03,377 --> 00:15:05,832
Did you see that?

220
00:15:05,883 --> 00:15:10,627
Excuse me. Where can a guy find one of those things?

221
00:15:10,644 --> 00:15:14,652
I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower.

222
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:20,857
Not just any flower... a panda lilly. I've seen it in action and boy does it work.

223
00:15:20,906 --> 00:15:22,943
Flowers are fine once you're married,...

224
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:28,687
...but at this early stage it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness.

225
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:30,671
But my heart is telling me to get this flower,...

226
00:15:30,695 --> 00:15:34,710
...and Aunt Wu said if I trusted my heart I would be with the one I love.

227
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:38,810
What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff too.

228
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:41,359
Well, Aunt Wu hasn't been wrong yet.

229
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:45,495
Why should she be wrong about love?*

230
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:48,648
There, on the rim!

231
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:57,947
Oh no! Aunt Wu was wrong.

232
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,140
Those people all think they're safe. We've got to warn 'em.

233
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:13,924
There's no time to walk. Grab on.

234
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:24,368
Hi, Katara.

235
00:16:24,426 --> 00:16:28,446
Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her?

236
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:30,031
But, she doesn't even charge.

237
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,523
I know, but still.

238
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:35,971
Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.

239
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,612
Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before.

240
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:42,487
It's going to take an awful lot to change my min...

241
00:16:42,578 --> 00:16:44,587
Oh, no!

242
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:50,037
Everyone! That volcano is gonna blow any second. Aunt Wu was wrong!

243
00:16:50,113 --> 00:16:55,041
Yeh, yeh, we know you don't believe in Aunt Wu, "Mr. Science and Reason Lover."

244
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:58,204
If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me.

245
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:01,243
I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do,...

246
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:04,671
...but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes.

247
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:10,519
Well I heard Aunt Wu's prediction with my own ears.

248
00:17:10,584 --> 00:17:15,838
Please listen to us! You are all in danger! And we have to get out of here.

249
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:21,658
You can't rely on Aunt Wu's prediction. You have to take fate into your own hands.

250
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:26,364
Look! Can your fortunetelling explain that?

251
00:17:27,287 --> 00:17:30,324
Can your science explain why it rains?

252
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:34,850
Yes! Yes, it can!

253
00:17:37,244 --> 00:17:39,488
They just won't listen to reason.

254
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:41,914
But they will listen to Aunt Wu.

255
00:17:42,012 --> 00:17:43,819
I know, that's the problem.

256
00:17:43,903 --> 00:17:48,484
Well, it's about to become the solution. We're taking fate in our own hands.

257
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:53,024
First, I need to borrow Aunt Wu's cloud reading book.

258
00:18:01,294 --> 00:18:05,182
Shh... we don't want anyone to hear us.

259
00:18:05,268 --> 00:18:08,653
Oh, oh! I didn't see you there.

260
00:18:08,747 --> 00:18:10,555
You don't like me. Do you?

261
00:18:10,651 --> 00:18:12,234
Of course I like you.

262
00:18:12,328 --> 00:18:15,241
But not the way I like you.

263
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:17,739
Oh. I guess not.

264
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:22,171
It's ok. It's just really hard when you like someone,...

265
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:25,011
...but they don't think of you that way.

266
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:26,724
I know what you mean.

267
00:18:26,819 --> 00:18:28,720
She's beautiful, by the way.

268
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:29,524
Huh?

269
00:18:29,613 --> 00:18:33,592
That water tribe girl. I can see why you like her so much.

270
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:41,102
She's sweet, she's a bender, and her hair seems so manageable.

271
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:42,110
Don't worry.

272
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:46,537
You're gonna meet a great guy who's gonna completely fall for you. I know it.

273
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:51,505
Thanks. Wait! Don't you want this?

274
00:18:51,593 --> 00:18:52,764
How did you know?

275
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,187
I've kind of been stalking you... heh!

276
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:00,385
Oh, thanks. I... I guess.

277
00:19:02,132 --> 00:19:05,548
Clouds are made of water and air so between the two of us...

278
00:19:05,626 --> 00:19:08,708
...we ought to be able to bend them into any shape we want.

279
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:13,007
I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom.

280
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:43,207
Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds.

281
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:49,433
That's very strange. It shouldn't... Oh my!

282
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:59,813
We can still save the village if we act fast. Sokka has a plan.

283
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,263
Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot.

284
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,517
If we can dig a deep enough trench...

285
00:20:03,608 --> 00:20:06,573
...we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river.

286
00:20:06,656 --> 00:20:09,466
If any of you are earthbenders come with me.

287
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:10,856
I'm an earthbender!

288
00:20:10,939 --> 00:20:11,981
I'm not!

289
00:20:12,071 --> 00:20:18,236
Everybody else grab a shovel... come on, we've gotta hurry!

290
00:20:35,725 --> 00:20:39,103
Dig faster! Dig faster!

291
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,260
Everyone needs to evacuate! We'll come for you when it's safe!

292
00:21:14,968 --> 00:21:19,270
It's too much! It's gonna overflow!

293
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:55,475
Man, sometimes I forget what powerful bender that kid is.

294
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:57,589
Wait, what did you just say?

295
00:21:57,676 --> 00:22:01,990
Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender.

296
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:07,991
I suppose he is...

297
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:14,958
By the way, we kind of borrowed your book.

298
00:22:14,998 --> 00:22:19,985
So you messed with the clouds did you!

299
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:21,995
Very clever!

300
00:22:22,082 --> 00:22:24,437
No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson...

301
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:27,045
...about not relying too much on fortunetelling.

302
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:31,383
But Aunt Wu predicted the village wouldn't be destroyed, and it wasn't.

303
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:33,569
She was right, after all.

304
00:22:33,639 --> 00:22:35,078
I hate you.

305
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:38,398
It's ok, Sokka. Everything's gonna be all right.

306
00:22:38,478 --> 00:22:40,105
Can I ask you something?

307
00:22:40,178 --> 00:22:41,638
Of course, honey.

308
00:22:41,696 --> 00:22:44,175
You didn't really see love in my fortune, did you?

309
00:22:44,249 --> 00:22:46,374
You just told me what I wanted to hear.

310
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:52,035
I'll tell you a little secret, young Airbender. Just as you reshaped those clouds,...

311
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:56,664
...you have the power to reshape your own destiny.

312
00:22:56,756 --> 00:23:01,595
Goodbye everyone! It was so nice to meet you! Take care, Meng.

313
00:23:01,686 --> 00:23:04,831
Take care!

314
00:23:06,991 --> 00:23:09,505
Floozy.

00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612

Book One: Water
Chapter Fifteen: Bato of the Water Tribe

15
00:01:01,058 --> 00:01:03,537
Hey look! A sword made out of a whale's tooth.

16
00:01:03,575 --> 00:01:06,003
Lemme see that.

17
00:01:15,144 --> 00:01:19,915
This is a water tribe weapon. See if you can find anything else.

18
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:21,375
Did someone lose something?

19
00:01:21,467 --> 00:01:23,688
No, we found something.

20
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:28,319
It's burned.

21
00:01:28,664 --> 00:01:33,241
There was a battle. Water tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders.

22
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:38,549
The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill...

23
00:01:43,123 --> 00:01:44,476
So then what happened?

24
00:01:44,573 --> 00:01:47,035
I don't know. The trail ends here.

25
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,093
Wait! Look!

26
00:01:49,164 --> 00:01:51,783
It's one of our boats!

27
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,448
Is this... Dad's boat?

28
00:01:54,527 --> 00:02:00,034
No, but it's from his fleet. Dad was here.

29
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:11,524
See, Prince Zuko, a moment of quiet is good for your mental well being.

30
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:17,874
Get back! We're after a stowaway.

31
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:21,440
There are no stowaways on my ship.

32
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,041
He's paralyzed.

33
00:02:37,122 --> 00:02:40,171
Only temporarily. The toxins'll wear off in about an hour.

34
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,895
But by then he'll be in jail and I'll have my money.

35
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:45,157
But how did you find him on my ship?

36
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:48,476
My shirshu can smell a rat a continent away.

37
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:51,866
Well, I'm impressed.

38
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:58,575
Very impressed.

39
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:17,204
Sokka...

40
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,369
I'm coming with you.

41
00:03:18,429 --> 00:03:21,662
You're not old enough to go to war, Sokka, you know that.

42
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:26,872
I'm strong! I'm brave! I can fight! Please, Dad!

43
00:03:26,942 --> 00:03:29,850
Being a man is knowing where you're needed the most,...

44
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:33,918
...and for you right now that's here protecting your sister.

45
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:35,513
I don't understand.

46
00:03:35,574 --> 00:03:42,414
Someday you will. I'm going to miss you so much.

47
00:03:46,544 --> 00:03:49,117
Who's there?

48
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:49,999
Sokka?

49
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,195
Bato?

50
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:52,834
Who the what now?

51
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:54,001
Bato!

52
00:03:54,091 --> 00:04:01,723
Sokka! Katara! It is so good to see you two! Oh, you've grown so much.

53
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,056
Hi, I'm Aang.

54
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:03,716
Where's Dad?

55
00:04:03,788 --> 00:04:04,596
Is he here?

56
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:10,907
No, he and the other warriors should be in the eastern Earth Kingdom by now.

57
00:04:11,874 --> 00:04:16,558
This is no place for a reunion. Let's get inside.

58
00:04:20,766 --> 00:04:25,150
After I was wounded, your father carried me to this abbey.

59
00:04:25,244 --> 00:04:30,561
The sisters have cared for me ever since. Superior, these are Hakoda's children.

60
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:33,952
They've been traveling with the Avatar. I found them by my boat.

61
00:04:34,026 --> 00:04:40,248
Young Avatar, it gives me great joy to be in your presence. Welcome to our abbey.

62
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,712
Thank you! It's truly an honor to be here. If there's anything...

63
00:04:43,758 --> 00:04:46,633
What smells so good, Bato?

64
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:49,569
The sisters craft ointments and perfumes.

65
00:04:49,645 --> 00:04:52,212
Perfume? Maybe we could dump some on Appa?

66
00:04:52,293 --> 00:04:57,141
Because he stinks so much! Am I right?

67
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,610
You have your father's wit.

68
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:03,442
Bato! It looks like home!

69
00:05:03,534 --> 00:05:06,178
Everything's here, even the pelts!

70
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:11,164
Yeh, nothing's more comforting than dead animal skins.

71
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:19,329
No way! Stewed sea prunes?

72
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,136
Help yourself.

73
00:05:21,212 --> 00:05:24,737
Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things.

74
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:30,058
Bato, is it true you and Dad lassoed an arctic hippo?

75
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:35,432
It was your father's idea. He just dragged me along. Well, the hippo did the dragging.

76
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:39,259
Hey, I ride animals too! One time there was this giant eel...

77
00:05:39,329 --> 00:05:42,282
So who was it that came up with the great blubber fiasco?

78
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:43,801
You knew about that?

79
00:05:43,859 --> 00:05:45,213
Everyone does.

80
00:05:45,285 --> 00:05:46,451
What's that story?

81
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,484
It's a long one, Aang, some other time.

82
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:51,618
You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures.

83
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:57,080
Not all of which were hilarious at the time, but everything's funny with hindsight.

84
00:05:57,159 --> 00:06:02,610
Aang, put that down, it's ceremonial and very fragile.

85
00:06:02,676 --> 00:06:04,653
Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head...

86
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:07,013
...and convinced Gran Gran you were a water spirit?

87
00:06:07,091 --> 00:06:12,900
Your dad wore the octopus, but I did the spooky voice.

88
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,337
Out of my way! Step aside, filth!

89
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:31,749
He means no offense! I'm sure you bathe regularly.

90
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,316
I need to talk to you.

91
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:39,478
Well, if it isn't my new friends, Angry Boy and Uncle Lazy.

92
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:49,621
Your beast trashed my ship. You have to pay me back.

93
00:06:49,719 --> 00:06:56,980
Aww, I'd love to help you out, but I'm a little short on money. Drinks on me!

94
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:02,726
Money isn't what I had in mind.

95
00:07:03,078 --> 00:07:04,908
I need you to find someone.

96
00:07:05,004 --> 00:07:07,634
What happened? Your girlfriend run off on you?

97
00:07:07,702 --> 00:07:11,505
It's not the girl I'm after, it's the bald monk she's traveling with.

98
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:12,953
Whatever you say.

99
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:18,148
If you find them, I'll consider the damage to my ship paid for.

100
00:07:18,214 --> 00:07:19,248
Forget it.

101
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:22,819
Plus we'll pay your weight in gold.

102
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:26,583
Make it your weight and we got a deal.

103
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:27,614
You got it!

104
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,305
Get on.

105
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,005
There's something I should tell you kids. I'm expecting a message from your father.

106
00:07:46,062 --> 00:07:46,987
Really?

107
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:47,899
When?

108
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,654
Any day now. Your father said he'd send a message...

109
00:07:50,731 --> 00:07:52,593
...when they found the rendezvous point.

110
00:07:52,662 --> 00:07:55,234
If you wait here until the message arrives...

111
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:57,953
...you can come with me and see your father again.

112
00:07:58,028 --> 00:08:03,252
It's been over two years since we've seen Dad! That would be so incredible. Katara?

113
00:08:03,331 --> 00:08:07,072
I do really miss him. It would be great to see Dad.

114
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,489
It's been far too long, hasn't it?

115
00:08:10,572 --> 00:08:15,704
I'm not sure when word will arrive, but when it does...

116
00:08:16,857 --> 00:08:21,352
It would be great, but we can't. We have to take Aang to the North Pole first.

117
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:25,317
Even if we had time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel.

118
00:08:25,408 --> 00:08:27,377
We don't have time for a long detour.

119
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:30,825
I'm sure your father would understand and be proud...

120
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:34,777
...that his children are helping the Avatar.

121
00:08:37,172 --> 00:08:40,456
I can't believe they would leave me.

122
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:47,087
I'm looking for Bato of the Water Tribe.

123
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:49,396
Uh, I know Bato.

124
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:51,995
Make sure he gets this.

125
00:08:56,005 --> 00:09:00,297
It's the map to Sokka and Katara's Dad!

126
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:17,995
Hey everyone! Sorry I was gone so long.

127
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:20,030
Hey Aang, I didn't notice you left.

128
00:09:20,082 --> 00:09:28,452
Yup, but now I'm back. Sure... could go for some delicious sea prunes!

129
00:09:40,451 --> 00:09:43,189
Out for a bit of fresh air, are we?

130
00:09:43,257 --> 00:09:44,617
We're looking for someone.

131
00:09:44,677 --> 00:09:53,097
I hope it's not Miyuki. Miyuki, did you get in trouble with the Fire Nation again?

132
00:09:53,165 --> 00:09:56,867
The Avatar's been through here. Let's keep moving.

133
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:15,807
Aha! I caught you! You should be ashamed of yourself... littering in the courtyard.

134
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:18,772
I'm sorry! I'll take care of this.

135
00:10:23,613 --> 00:10:28,946
This ship is sentimental to me. It was built by my father.

136
00:10:33,764 --> 00:10:36,324
Is this the boat he took you ice-dodging in?

137
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:40,816
Yeh, it's got the scar to prove it. Huh. How about you, Sokka?

138
00:10:40,898 --> 00:10:44,123
You must have some good stories from your first time ice-dodging?

139
00:10:44,206 --> 00:10:47,612
He never got to go. Dad left before he was old enough.

140
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:50,080
Oh, I forgot, you were too young.

141
00:10:50,153 --> 00:10:51,507
What's ice-dodging?

142
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,712
It's a rite of passage for young water tribe members.

143
00:10:54,772 --> 00:10:57,720
When you turn fourteen your Dad takes you...

144
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:01,955
...you know what, you're about to find out.

145
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:13,176
Why are we stopping?

146
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,545
Because the girl must of spent a lot of time here.

147
00:11:15,632 --> 00:11:18,068
We have no time for this!

148
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,351
Hey, watch it!

149
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:24,494
Oh look, he likes you.

150
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,341
Care to hear your fortune, handsome?

151
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:31,186
At my age there is really only one big surprise left,...

152
00:11:31,263 --> 00:11:36,154
...and I'd just as soon leave it a mystery.

153
00:11:39,978 --> 00:11:45,125
Ice-dodging is a ceremonial test of wisdom, bravery and trust.

154
00:11:45,187 --> 00:11:49,068
In our village it was done by weaving a boat through a field of icebergs.

155
00:11:49,143 --> 00:11:51,724
How are we supposed to ice-dodge without ice?

156
00:11:51,801 --> 00:11:56,095
You will be dodging... those.

157
00:11:58,486 --> 00:12:04,967
Sokka, you steer and call the shots. Lead wisely. Katara, you secure the mainsail.

158
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:09,773
The winds can be brutal, so be brave. Aang, you control the jib,...

159
00:12:09,848 --> 00:12:15,845
...without your steady hand we all go down. Your position is about trust.

160
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:21,828
I know that! Why wouldn't I know that? I'm the Avatar! I know about trust.

161
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:28,876
For this to be done right I cannot help. You pass or fail on your own.

162
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:37,578
Aang, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady!

163
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:44,347
Aang, less sail! Katara, give him room!

164
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,628
Aang! Helm to lee! Helm to lee!

165
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,701
What does that even mean!?

166
00:13:05,245 --> 00:13:07,615
Great job!

167
00:13:09,693 --> 00:13:11,291
There's no way through!

168
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:12,476
We can make it!

169
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:15,131
Sokka, you've already proven yourself, maybe we should...

170
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,456
Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail!

171
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:22,784
Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks!

172
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,900
Now!

173
00:13:43,359 --> 00:13:47,117
The spirits of water bear witness to these marks.

174
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:53,234
For Sokka, the mark of the wise, the same mark your father earned.

175
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:58,356
For Katara, the mark of the brave. Your courage inspires us.

176
00:13:58,437 --> 00:14:02,111
And for Aang, the mark of the trusted.

177
00:14:02,187 --> 00:14:05,500
You are now an honorary member of the water tribe.

178
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:06,626
I can't.

179
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:08,772
Of course you can!

180
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,130
No, you can't trust me.

181
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:14,184
Aang, what are you talking about.

182
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:17,994
A messenger gave this to me for Bato.

183
00:14:18,051 --> 00:14:20,350
You have to understand, I was afraid you'd...

184
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:25,694
This is the map to our father! You had it the whole time!? How could you?

185
00:14:25,755 --> 00:14:29,764
Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own! I'm going to find Dad.

186
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,151
Now Sokka, I think you should...

187
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:34,493
Katara, are you with me?

188
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:40,439
I'm with you, Sokka.

189
00:14:58,418 --> 00:14:59,709
Good luck.

190
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,022
Okay. You too.

191
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,606
Guess I should be moving on.

192
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:12,798
That would be best.

193
00:15:17,637 --> 00:15:20,697
I'm an idiot, Momo.

194
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:42,275
We're getting close.

195
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,807
That wolf sounds so sad.

196
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,453
It's probably wounded.

197
00:15:54,516 --> 00:15:59,821
No, it's been separated from the pack. I understand that pain.

198
00:15:59,895 --> 00:16:04,140
It's how I felt when the water tribe warriors had to leave me behind.

199
00:16:04,212 --> 00:16:10,903
They were my family and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds.

200
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:19,000
Sokka?

201
00:16:19,082 --> 00:16:20,316
We need to go back.

202
00:16:20,394 --> 00:16:24,265
I want to see Dad, but helping Aang is where we're needed the most.

203
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,544
You're right.

204
00:16:25,608 --> 00:16:29,792
Your father will understand. And I know he's proud of you.

205
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:30,945
Thanks, Bato.

206
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:34,952
I know where to go from here. Take this in case you want to find us.

207
00:16:35,015 --> 00:16:39,017
I'll leave a message at the rendezvous point.

208
00:16:39,223 --> 00:16:41,188
Looks like we're going alone, guys.

209
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,529
Avatar! You must leave!

210
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:46,443
Okay, I get it. Everybody wants me gone.

211
00:16:46,497 --> 00:16:49,060
A group of people came to the abbey looking for you.

212
00:16:49,127 --> 00:16:49,915
Who?

213
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:54,105
A fierce looking woman with a horrible monster and a young man with a scar.

214
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,098
Zuko!

215
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:58,003
The beast was using the scent of a necklace to follow you.

216
00:16:58,082 --> 00:17:02,676
A necklace? Huh! Katara!

217
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:19,470
So this is your girlfriend. No wonder she left. She's way too pretty for you.

218
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:21,957
Where is he? Where's the Avatar?

219
00:17:22,004 --> 00:17:23,983
We split up! He's long gone.

220
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:26,425
How stupid do you think I am?

221
00:17:26,484 --> 00:17:29,684
Pretty stupid. Run!

222
00:17:32,566 --> 00:17:35,461
What are we supposed to do now?

223
00:17:35,936 --> 00:17:42,061
It's seeking a different scent... perhaps something that the Avatar held.

224
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:59,583
What's it doing? It's just going around in a circle!

225
00:18:11,707 --> 00:18:12,482
Aang!

226
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:14,411
Up!

227
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:57,952
I'm starting to get some feeling back!

228
00:20:22,912 --> 00:20:25,588
You've got something I want!

229
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:25,524
That thing sees with its nose. Let's give him something to look at.

230
00:21:25,598 --> 00:21:27,593
The perfume?

231
00:21:58,381 --> 00:22:02,421
June! Noooo!

232
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:15,406
Uncle? I didn't see you get hit with the tongue.

233
00:22:20,312 --> 00:22:22,722
So, where do we go?

234
00:22:22,796 --> 00:22:24,651
We're getting you to the North Pole.

235
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:27,715
Yeh, we've lost too much time as it is.

236
00:22:27,777 --> 00:22:29,237
Don't you want to see your father?

237
00:22:29,285 --> 00:22:34,628
Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family too, and right now, you need us more.

238
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:36,763
And we need you.

239
00:22:36,824 --> 00:22:41,094
I wish I could give you a little piece of home, Katara. Something to remind you...

240
00:22:41,147 --> 00:22:42,171
I'll be okay.

241
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:48,235
Still, just a little trinket. Maybe something like... this!

242
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:51,097
Aang, how did you get that?

243
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:54,411
Zuko asked to be sure I got it to you.

244
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:59,186
Oh, that's so sweet of Zuko. Would you give him a kiss for me when you see him?

245
00:22:59,247 --> 00:23:01,648
Sure!

<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048

00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water
Chapter Sixteen: The Deserter

15
00:01:01,292 --> 00:01:03,778
This should give us a good idea of what's around here.

16
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:06,421
See if you can find a menu, I'm starving.

17
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:10,704
I bet we'll find something to eat here! The Fire Days Festival.

18
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:15,179
Fire Nation cultural exhibits... jugglers, benders, magicians.

19
00:01:15,232 --> 00:01:18,672
This'd be a great place for me to study some real firebenders!

20
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:21,876
You might wanna rethink that. Look at this.

21
00:01:21,934 --> 00:01:23,573
Hey, a poster of me!

22
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:27,519
A wanted poster. This is bad.

23
00:01:27,564 --> 00:01:29,229
I think we better keep moving.

24
00:01:29,302 --> 00:01:31,201
I have to learn firebending at some point,...

25
00:01:31,241 --> 00:01:34,912
...and this could be my only chance to watch a master up close.

26
00:01:34,956 --> 00:01:36,904
I guess we could check it out.

27
00:01:36,949 --> 00:01:39,607
What!? You want to walk into a Fire Nation town...

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,020
...where they're all fired up with all their, you know, fire?

29
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:46,070
We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave.

30
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:52,331
Yeh, because we always leave before we get into trouble.

31
00:02:00,374 --> 00:02:04,973
You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival.

32
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:13,764
Ready disguises!

33
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:22,513
It's like you're a whole different person.

34
00:02:22,562 --> 00:02:24,321
Let's go.

35
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:42,607
I think we need some new disguises.

36
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,810
Where are we gonna get masks like that?

37
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:48,729
Get your genu-ine Fire Festival masks here!

38
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,800
That was surprisingly easy.

39
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:02,474
Hey, there's some food.

40
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:05,156
Finally! What do you have?

41
00:03:05,211 --> 00:03:07,904
Flaming fire flakes! Best in town.

42
00:03:07,961 --> 00:03:09,588
I'll take 'em!

43
00:03:09,658 --> 00:03:12,323
Aaahh! Hot! Hot!

44
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:16,166
"Flaming fire flakes" hot? What do you know?

45
00:03:16,206 --> 00:03:18,596
Hey, look at this.

46
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,165
Don't worry loyal citizens! No one can surprise the Fire Lord!

47
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:27,059
Oh, no!

48
00:03:33,163 --> 00:03:35,592
Aang, hold on! Where are we going?

49
00:03:35,667 --> 00:03:38,768
I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good.

50
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,637
Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.

51
00:03:49,701 --> 00:03:51,485
I gotta learn that trick!

52
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:55,672
Thank you! For my next trick I need a volunteer from the audience!

53
00:03:55,764 --> 00:03:57,221
Oh! Oh! Me! Me!

54
00:03:57,293 --> 00:03:58,718
What do you think you're doing?

55
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,595
I want to get a closer look.

56
00:04:00,664 --> 00:04:03,713
It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.

57
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:07,185
How about you, little lady?

58
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:13,383
Awww, She's shy. Leeet's give her some encouragement, folks!

59
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:17,808
Awww! That could'a been me.

60
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:27,610
This next trick is called "Taming the Dragon." You will be my captured princess!

61
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,251
Don't worry, young maiden! I will tame this fiery beast!

62
00:04:46,658 --> 00:04:49,390
It's too strong, I can't hold it!

63
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:50,854
We gotta help her!

64
00:04:50,934 --> 00:04:52,820
No, we don't want to make a scene!

65
00:04:52,869 --> 00:04:56,058
The rope, it's breaking!

66
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:09,541
Hey, you tryin' to upstage me, kid?

67
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,680
Hey! That kid's the Avatar!

68
00:05:22,216 --> 00:05:23,896
I think it's time to go.

69
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:26,027
Follow me! I can git ya outta here!

70
00:05:26,084 --> 00:05:28,134
There they are!

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,564
Over there!

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,900
I'm calling Appa!

73
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,858
I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!

74
00:05:46,915 --> 00:05:48,926
This way!

75
00:05:50,264 --> 00:05:53,144
Okay! Not this way!

76
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:09,317
Appa! Down here!

77
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:36,682
Nice touch setting off the fireworks.

78
00:06:36,764 --> 00:06:38,899
You seem to really know your explosives.

79
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:40,228
I'm familiar.

80
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,981
You're a Fire Nation soldier!

81
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:45,595
Was. My name's Chey.

82
00:06:47,003 --> 00:06:53,053
I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend,...

83
00:06:53,132 --> 00:06:59,404
...Jeong Jeong the Deserter. He was a Fire Nation general, or wait, was he an admiral?

84
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,455
He was very highly ranked, we get it.

85
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:05,203
Yeh! Way up there! But he couldn't take the madness any more.

86
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:08,250
He's the first person ever to leave the army... and live.

87
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:12,125
I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for that. That's okay though.

88
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:14,457
Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius.

89
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:18,868
Some say he's mad... but he's not! He's enlightened.

90
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,048
You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord?

91
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,681
We've gotta go see him! He can train me!

92
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:27,174
We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender!

93
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:33,169
He's not crazy! He's a genius! And he's the perfect person to train the Avatar!

94
00:07:33,229 --> 00:07:35,531
That's why I followed you into the festival.

95
00:07:35,591 --> 00:07:39,201
Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the north pole in the morning.

96
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:43,545
Sokka, this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master...

97
00:07:43,603 --> 00:07:46,006
...who would actually be willing to teach me.

98
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:47,717
It can't hurt just to talk to him.

99
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,298
That's what you said about going to the festival!

100
00:07:50,342 --> 00:07:53,906
Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me!?

101
00:07:58,413 --> 00:08:01,452
Don't move!

102
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:09,941
Jeong Jeong told you not to look for Avatar!

103
00:08:09,977 --> 00:08:11,788
Hold on, you know these guys!?

104
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:15,346
Oh yeh! Lin Yi's an old buddy! Right Lin Yi?

105
00:08:15,406 --> 00:08:18,591
Shut up! Keep moving.

106
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:29,212
Go on. He sees you only.

107
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:31,670
Oh that's okay, we can chat later.

108
00:08:31,725 --> 00:08:35,017
Is that where Jeong Jeong is?
I need to talk to him right away.

109
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:38,391
No! You wait there. Go now!

110
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:46,194
Don't worry! Everything'll be fine. He's a great man, great man!

111
00:08:48,197 --> 00:08:52,103
So, the Avatar was here and you let slip away?

112
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:57,241
Yes, sir, but other than that the festival went off without a hitch!

113
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:59,371
No fights. Theft was way down.

114
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:04,153
I don't care about your local crime rates! Which way did they go?

115
00:09:04,213 --> 00:09:07,019
They headed into the forest, up the river I suspect.

116
00:09:07,049 --> 00:09:13,345
Ready the river boats. We're going after the Avatar.

117
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:22,560
What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now?

118
00:09:22,632 --> 00:09:26,104
He won't see you. He's very angry that I brought you here.

119
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:27,571
He wants you to leave immediately.

120
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,656
Finally! Let's hit the road.

121
00:09:29,712 --> 00:09:31,615
Why won't he see me?

122
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,081
He says you're not ready.

123
00:09:33,121 --> 00:09:36,007
Says you haven't mastered waterbending and earthbending yet.

124
00:09:36,052 --> 00:09:37,984
Wait, how does he know that?

125
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:41,320
He saw the way you walked into camp. He can tell.

126
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,732
I'm going in anyway!

127
00:09:52,618 --> 00:09:55,376
Get out.

128
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,908
Master, I need to learn firebending.

129
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:04,364
Only a fool seeks his own destruction.

130
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,549
I'm the Avatar. It's my destiny to...

131
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:09,813
Destiny? What would a boy know of destiny?

132
00:10:09,892 --> 00:10:14,475
If a fish lives its whole life in this river, does he know the river's destiny?

133
00:10:14,505 --> 00:10:18,690
No! Only that it runs on and on out of his control!

134
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:25,852
He may follow where it flows, but he cannot see the end. He cannot imagine the ocean.

135
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:31,260
Ookay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.

136
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:36,688
To master the bending disciplines, you must first master discipline itself.

137
00:10:36,738 --> 00:10:42,151
But you have no interest in this, so I have no interest in you! Now, get out.

138
00:10:42,195 --> 00:10:46,791
Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance.

139
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:51,475
Are you deaf! How can I teach you if you refuse to listen?

140
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:55,479
Before learning firebending you must learn water and earth.

141
00:10:55,541 --> 00:11:02,889
Water is cool and soothing, earth is steady and stable, but fire, fire is alive!

142
00:11:02,966 --> 00:11:07,737
It breathes, it grows, without a bender, a rock will not throw itself!

143
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:11,431
But fire will spread and destroy everything in its path...

144
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:14,636
...if one does not have the will to control it!

145
00:11:14,668 --> 00:11:21,561
That is its destiny! You are not ready! You are too weak!

146
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,777
You think I am weak?

147
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:30,134
Avatar Roku! No! No! I did not mean that!

148
00:11:30,204 --> 00:11:35,030
I have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes.

149
00:11:35,103 --> 00:11:42,647
Now, I must do it once again. You will teach the Avatar firebending.

150
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,394
Yes, yes, I will teach you.

151
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:50,981
Really? That's great!

152
00:11:55,563 --> 00:12:05,544
Widen your stance. Wider! Bend your knees. Now, concentrate. Good, good!

153
00:12:05,588 --> 00:12:07,279
Wait! What do I do now?

154
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:12,327
Silence! Talking is not concentrating! Look at your friend, is she talking?

155
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,185
Even that oaf knows to concentrate on what he's doing!

156
00:12:15,223 --> 00:12:16,078
Hey!

157
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,089
But what am I concentrating on?

158
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:22,939
Feel the heat of the sun. It is the greatest source of fire.

159
00:12:22,983 --> 00:12:25,888
Yet, it is in complete balance with nature!

160
00:12:25,935 --> 00:12:27,342
So when do I get to make some fire?

161
00:12:27,398 --> 00:12:30,090
Concentrate!

162
00:12:40,012 --> 00:12:43,342
Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?

163
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:44,956
No fire yet.

164
00:12:45,024 --> 00:12:46,882
What?

165
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,666
Power in firebending comes from the breath.

166
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,134
That is why you must master proper breath control.

167
00:12:53,208 --> 00:12:55,173
You brought me up here to breathe?

168
00:12:55,204 --> 00:12:56,727
Assume your stance.

169
00:12:56,755 --> 00:12:57,574
Wider.

170
00:12:57,602 --> 00:12:58,323
You're not even look...

171
00:12:58,359 --> 00:13:02,699
Wider! Now, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth...

172
00:13:02,763 --> 00:13:05,835
...without talking.

173
00:13:07,973 --> 00:13:11,737
Good. Keep going.

174
00:13:20,189 --> 00:13:23,313
What are you doing here!? I did not tell you to stop!

175
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,208
I've been breathing for hours.

176
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:27,233
You want to stop breathing?

177
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:29,550
I want you to stop wasting my time!

178
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,550
I already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun.

179
00:13:32,575 --> 00:13:37,572
I want to know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips!

180
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:42,648
I had a pupil once who had no interest in learning discipline.

181
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,630
He was only concerned with the power of fire...

182
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:47,864
...how he could use it to destroy his opponents...

183
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:54,590
...and wipe out the obstacles in his path, but fire is a horrible burden to bear.

184
00:13:54,658 --> 00:14:03,487
Its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything around it.

185
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:19,973
Learn restraint, or risk destroying yourself and everything you love.

186
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:31,450
I thought about what you said. I promise I'll be more patient.

187
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:34,524
We're going to work with fire now.

188
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:36,992
Oh yeh!

189
00:14:37,848 --> 00:14:40,970
I mean, let us begin.

190
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:47,034
Concentrate on the fire. I want you to keep this flame...

191
00:14:47,098 --> 00:14:51,857
...from reaching the edges of the leaf for as long as you can.

192
00:14:51,898 --> 00:14:53,972
Master! There is trouble.

193
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,050
What's going on?

194
00:14:55,121 --> 00:14:56,633
Concentrate on your leaf.

195
00:14:56,685 --> 00:14:59,354
This is the worst firebending instruction ever.

196
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:03,176
All he does is leave me alone for hours to concentrate or breathe.

197
00:15:03,219 --> 00:15:05,086
I'm sure there's a good reason.

198
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:09,205
But I'm ready to do so much more.

199
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:24,206
I did it! I made fire!

200
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:27,877
Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow.

201
00:15:27,933 --> 00:15:30,148
Careful!

202
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,290
Now that's firebending!

203
00:15:34,097 --> 00:15:36,988
Aang, you'll hurt yourself!

204
00:15:40,996 --> 00:15:44,180
Wonder how that juggler did it?

205
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:53,076
Katara! I'm so sorry!

206
00:15:53,115 --> 00:15:56,462
Katara, what's wrong!? What did you do?

207
00:15:56,525 --> 00:16:00,503
Iiiit was an accident! I was... Katara, I'm so...

208
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:02,528
I told you we shouldn't mess around with this!

209
00:16:02,551 --> 00:16:07,843
Look what you did! You burned my sister!

210
00:16:19,801 --> 00:16:23,766
You burned my sister! This is all your fault!

211
00:16:23,813 --> 00:16:28,152
I know. Now pack your things. You must leave immediately.

212
00:16:28,202 --> 00:16:34,408
I'm sorry, I didn't... I'm sorry!

213
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,900
You have healing abilities.

214
00:17:04,964 --> 00:17:08,926
The great benders of the water tribe sometimes have this ability.

215
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:14,535
I've always wished I were blessed like you... free from this burning curse.

216
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:18,387
But you're a great master. You have powers I'll never know.

217
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:24,956
Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain.

218
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:28,849
It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge...

219
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:37,508
...between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart.

220
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,642
Go get your friends and flee!

221
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:50,789
Do not come back here or you will all be destroyed. Hurry!

222
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:14,152
Don't worry, men. My old teacher gave up fighting a long time ago.

223
00:18:14,209 --> 00:18:16,949
Master Jeong Jeong.

224
00:18:22,304 --> 00:18:24,002
Katara! Are you all right?

225
00:18:24,067 --> 00:18:29,718
I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang?

226
00:18:35,353 --> 00:18:38,100
Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready.

227
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:41,586
I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again.

228
00:18:41,615 --> 00:18:43,509
You'll have to eventually.

229
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:45,528
No, never again.

230
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:47,771
It's okay, Aang. I'm healed.

231
00:18:47,814 --> 00:18:49,647
What? How?

232
00:18:49,691 --> 00:18:53,168
I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here.

233
00:18:53,181 --> 00:18:55,620
Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!

234
00:18:55,678 --> 00:18:56,385
Where?

235
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,085
By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong.

236
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:01,737
I have to help him!

237
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:06,067
Look at you. You were once so great.

238
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,999
I can't believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage.

239
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:13,947
It is you who have embraced savagery, Zhao.

240
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:16,492
It's Admiral Zhao, now.

241
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:19,473
That title will not help you against the Avatar.

242
00:19:19,538 --> 00:19:22,608
Do not try to fight him! You are no match!

243
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:25,187
I think I can handle a child.

244
00:19:25,252 --> 00:19:29,959
I have never seen such raw power.

245
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:30,752
Jeong Jeong!

246
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:35,490
We'll see. Men! Take the deserter!

247
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:45,093
It's a trick! He's run off into the woods.

248
00:19:45,165 --> 00:19:47,816
Find him!

249
00:19:47,857 --> 00:19:51,290
Let's find out what my old master has taught you.

250
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:53,152
You were Jeong Jeong's student?

251
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,845
Until I got bored.

252
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:02,693
I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward.

253
00:20:02,736 --> 00:20:08,978
But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of!

254
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:11,569
Whoa! Wild shot!

255
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,026
I'll show you wild!

256
00:20:20,707 --> 00:20:23,787
No self control...

257
00:20:24,638 --> 00:20:26,785
Stand and fight, Avatar!

258
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:30,156
Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up.

259
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:32,292
I was!

260
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:40,060
Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!

261
00:20:43,601 --> 00:20:48,156
Ahoy! I'm Admiral Zhao!

262
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:59,675
I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko.

263
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,457
Sloppy. Very sloppy.

264
00:21:17,355 --> 00:21:22,259
No wonder to run now, you little smart mouth!

265
00:21:23,513 --> 00:21:26,299
You've lost this battle.

266
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:30,542
Are you crazy? You haven't thrown a single blow!

267
00:21:30,598 --> 00:21:33,769
No, but you have.

268
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:42,272
Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint.

269
00:21:49,726 --> 00:21:52,007
Have a nice walk home!

270
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:55,997
Aang, come on! Let's go!

271
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,545
Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?

272
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,891
He disappeared. They all did.

273
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:15,951
Hey, where did everybody go? Very funny guys!

274
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:26,480
Aang, you're burned.

275
00:22:27,884 --> 00:22:30,250
Let me help you.

276
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,227
Wow! That's good water.

277
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:45,147
When did you learn how to do that?

278
00:22:45,222 --> 00:22:47,112
I guess I always knew.

279
00:22:47,166 --> 00:22:50,068
Oh... well then thanks for all the first aid over the years.

280
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:52,129
Like when I fell into the grease briar bramble...

281
00:22:52,206 --> 00:22:55,370
...and that time I had two fish hooks in my thumb!

282
00:22:55,447 --> 00:22:56,323
Two?

283
00:22:56,382 --> 00:22:59,794
He tried to get the first fish hook out with another fish hook.

284
00:22:59,865 --> 00:23:02,218
Oh, and the time that big snake bit me!

285
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:07,289
Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful.

Book One: Water | Chapter Seventeen:
The Northern Air Temple

15
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:59,052
So travelers, the next time you think you hear a strange large bird talking,...

16
00:00:59,102 --> 00:01:06,153
...take a closer look, it might not be a giant parrot, but a flying man!

17
00:01:06,209 --> 00:01:10,741
A member of a secret group of air walkers who laugh at gravity...

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,380
...and laugh at those bound to the earth by it!

19
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,233
Aren't airbender stories the best?

20
00:01:18,323 --> 00:01:21,024
Was it realistic? Is that how it was back then?

21
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:25,297
I laugh at gravity all the time. Haha! Gravity.

22
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:28,179
Jingle, jingle!

23
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,047
Sorry!

24
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,289
Aww. Cheapskates!

25
00:01:35,358 --> 00:01:37,333
Hey thanks for the story!

26
00:01:37,397 --> 00:01:40,322
Tell it to the cap, boy!

27
00:01:43,517 --> 00:01:46,258
Much obliged little bat thing!

28
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:48,598
It means a lot to hear airbender stories.

29
00:01:48,669 --> 00:01:51,931
It must have been hundred years ago your great grandpa met them.

30
00:01:51,969 --> 00:01:58,408
What are you prattling about child? Great grand-pappy saw the air walkers last week!

31
00:02:05,294 --> 00:02:07,778
Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple!

32
00:02:07,838 --> 00:02:12,230
This is where they had the
championships for sky bison polo.

33
00:02:12,262 --> 00:02:14,742
Do you think we'll really find airbenders?

34
00:02:14,784 --> 00:02:16,869
You want me to be like you, or totally honest?

35
00:02:16,912 --> 00:02:18,295
Are you saying I'm a liar?

36
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,440
I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing basically.

37
00:02:21,492 --> 00:02:24,788
Hey guys, look at this!

38
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:35,342
Huh! They really are airbenders!

39
00:02:35,782 --> 00:02:36,935
No, they're not.

40
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:39,960
What do you mean they're not? Those guys are flying!

41
00:02:40,004 --> 00:02:43,546
Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they move.

42
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:48,190
They're not airbending. Those people have no spirit.

43
00:02:52,932 --> 00:02:56,927
I don't know, Aang. That kid seems pretty spirited!

44
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:11,837
We better find some solid ground before it finds us!

45
00:03:19,461 --> 00:03:24,571
Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!

46
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,313
Hey there! You're pretty good.

47
00:03:41,349 --> 00:03:45,468
Yeh, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding!

48
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:04,945
Wow! I don't think I can do that! But here's a good one...

49
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:27,704
What do you think?

50
00:04:27,772 --> 00:04:29,500
It's great.

51
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:50,098
Hey! You're a real airbender! You must be the Avatar!

52
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:54,013
That's amazing! I, I, I've heard stories about you.

53
00:04:54,048 --> 00:04:54,730
Thanks.

54
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:57,304
Wow! This glider chair is incredible!

55
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:02,810
If you think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my Dad designed.

56
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:28,806
Yeh, my Dad is the mastermind behind this whole place!

57
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,558
Everything's powered by hot air.

58
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:33,858
It even pumps hot air currents outside to give us a lift when we're gliding.

59
00:05:33,886 --> 00:05:35,631
This place is unbelievable.

60
00:05:35,684 --> 00:05:37,430
Yeh, it's great isn't it?

61
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,717
No, just unbelievable.

62
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:42,274
Aang used to come here a long time ago.

63
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:45,236
I think he's a little shocked it's so... different.

64
00:05:45,288 --> 00:05:47,514
So better!

65
00:05:52,262 --> 00:05:56,320
This is supposed to be the history of my people.

66
00:06:10,324 --> 00:06:14,704
I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.

67
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:22,295
It's nice to see even one part of the temple that isn't ruined.

68
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:25,296
Look out!

69
00:06:31,602 --> 00:06:36,302
What the doodle! Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites?

70
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:39,051
We have to make room for the bathhouse!

71
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:42,530
Do you know what you did? You just destroyed something sacred!

72
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,308
For a stupid bathhouse!

73
00:06:44,358 --> 00:06:47,135
Well, people around here are starting to stink.

74
00:06:47,175 --> 00:06:50,289
This whole place stinks!

75
00:06:56,957 --> 00:07:00,629
This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way.

76
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:03,689
I've seen it when the monks were here. I know what it's supposed to be like.

77
00:07:03,726 --> 00:07:07,122
The monks? But you're twelve!

78
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:12,445
Dad, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago.

79
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:14,778
What are you doing? Who said you could be here?

80
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:20,781
Hmmm... doing here... A long time ago, but not a hundred years,...

81
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:24,807
...my people became refugees after a terrible flood.

82
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:31,242
My infant son, Teo, was badly hurt and lost his mother.

83
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,411
I needed somewhere to rebuild and I stumbled across this place.

84
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:39,881
Couldn't believe it! Everywhere pictures of flying people.

85
00:07:39,957 --> 00:07:45,732
But empty! Nobody home! Then I came across these fan like contraptions!

86
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,516
Our gliders.

87
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,892
Yes, little light flying machines. They gave me an idea.

88
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:54,232
Build a new life for my son, in the air!

89
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:59,375
Then everyone would be on equal ground, so to speak!

90
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:04,259
We're just in the process of improving upon what's already here and after all,...

91
00:08:04,308 --> 00:08:07,191
...isn't that what nature does?

92
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:08,998
Nature knows where to stop.

93
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:10,734
I suppose that's true.

94
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:16,019
Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us.

95
00:08:16,077 --> 00:08:18,442
Look at the time!

96
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:22,809
Come the pulley system must be oiled before dark.

97
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:26,774
Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same.

98
00:08:26,835 --> 00:08:30,618
The candle will tell us. Watch.

99
00:08:31,276 --> 00:08:33,518
You put spark powder in the candle!

100
00:08:33,584 --> 00:08:40,796
Four flashes, so it's exactly four hours past midday, or, as I call it, four o'candle!

101
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:45,010
If you like that, wait till you see my finger safe knife sharpener!

102
00:08:45,079 --> 00:08:48,348
Only took me three tries to get it right!

103
00:08:50,828 --> 00:08:51,882
Follow me!

104
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:55,062
Hey Aang, I want to show you something.

105
00:08:55,192 --> 00:08:58,649
I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.

106
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,063
I don't know about that.

107
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:02,895
The Temple might be different, but the creatures that live here...

108
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:06,918
...are probably direct descendents of the ones that lived here a long time ago.

109
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:11,885
You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temples origins.

110
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:16,635
Besides, there's one part of the temple that hasn't changed at all.

111
00:09:16,702 --> 00:09:19,528
Hey! It's just like the one in the other Air Temple.

112
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:23,543
Only an airbender can open it... so inside it's completely untouched,...

113
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:28,399
...just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it was like in there.

114
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:29,113
Aang?

115
00:09:29,157 --> 00:09:33,487
I'm sorry, this is the last part of temple that the same as it was.

116
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:36,039
I want it to stay that way.

117
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:40,024
I completely understand. I just wanted you to know it was here.

118
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:41,738
Thanks.

119
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:50,709
These lanterns are terrible! I can't see.

120
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:53,289
Why would you want to use fireflies for light?

121
00:09:53,359 --> 00:10:01,012
Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose. Fireflies are a non-flammable light source.

122
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:09,504
Cover your nose and hold your breath.

123
00:10:09,552 --> 00:10:13,842
Okay, so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.

124
00:10:13,912 --> 00:10:14,724
Wrong.

125
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:20,265
It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here.

126
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:23,352
Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time.

127
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,220
Nearly blew myself and the whole place even more sky high.

128
00:10:27,284 --> 00:10:29,880
Thought my eyebrows would never grow back!

129
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:33,659
Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving.

130
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:39,559
From time to time we have gas leaks and they're nearly impossible to find.

131
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,388
So this place is an explosion waiting to happen?

132
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:49,543
Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell or touch.

133
00:10:49,592 --> 00:10:52,546
The wind will carry you. It supports something inside you...

134
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:58,366
...something even lighter than air, and that something takes over when you fly.

135
00:10:58,419 --> 00:11:02,948
I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something.

136
00:11:03,007 --> 00:11:05,142
Impossible! Everybody has it.

137
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,252
Spirit.

138
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,539
What?

139
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:09,381
That's the something you're talking about.

140
00:11:09,431 --> 00:11:12,366
Yeh, I suppose it is.

141
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:14,057
Are you ready?

142
00:11:14,135 --> 00:11:16,146
No!

143
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:27,330
I can't believe I'm flying!

144
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:31,897
Just make sure to keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!

145
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:38,018
Teo was right about the air! All I had to do was trust it. Let it carry me.

146
00:11:38,076 --> 00:11:43,644
Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one.

147
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,791
I've been thinking. If you wanna see what's in that room,...

148
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,925
...I'd be happy to open the door for you.

149
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:51,945
Great!

150
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,955
Wait! How do I land this thing?

151
00:11:55,011 --> 00:12:03,373
What if I land... eh! Blech! Yech! Bug! Bug! That was a bug!

152
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:09,936
I said don't touch anything!

153
00:12:10,538 --> 00:12:16,899
Oh, don't worry, that experiments old and that egg was just part of last week's lunch.

154
00:12:16,925 --> 00:12:19,849
Ugh! Week old egg smell!

155
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,821
Quick! Find that egg!

156
00:12:23,146 --> 00:12:27,522
I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside.

157
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,294
How could something that's so small you can't even see it make such a big stink!

158
00:12:43,343 --> 00:12:46,091
That's the solution to our problem!

159
00:12:46,143 --> 00:12:47,173
Yeh!

160
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:51,209
If we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up...

161
00:12:51,234 --> 00:12:54,442
The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs...

162
00:12:54,492 --> 00:12:55,744
Then, if there's a leak...

163
00:12:55,814 --> 00:12:57,685
You smell rotten eggs!

164
00:12:57,729 --> 00:13:01,751
Then you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from...

165
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:04,407
And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!

166
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:06,888
You're a genius!

167
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:10,396
Something's wrong I've got to go.

168
00:13:23,326 --> 00:13:25,356
This is a nightmare.

169
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,703
You don't understand.

170
00:13:27,728 --> 00:13:31,070
You're making weapons for the Fire Nation!

171
00:13:37,188 --> 00:13:40,727
You make weapons for the Fire Nation!?

172
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,879
Explain all this! Now!

173
00:13:43,937 --> 00:13:50,272
It was about a year after we moved here. Fire Nation soldiers found our settlement.

174
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:53,033
You were too young to remember this tale.

175
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:56,427
They were going to destroy everything, burn it to the ground.

176
00:13:56,472 --> 00:14:02,415
I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us. They asked what I had to offer.

177
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:09,295
I offered... my services. You must understand, I did this for you!

178
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,758
When are they coming?

179
00:14:20,812 --> 00:14:23,999
Soon. Very soon.

180
00:14:24,056 --> 00:14:26,493
You can't give them more weapons.

181
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:31,212
If I don't give them what they want they will destroy this place.

182
00:14:32,276 --> 00:14:37,014
How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder?

183
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:40,629
I need some time to think.

184
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,940
You need to leave! Go!

185
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:43,922
We're not leaving!

186
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:46,542
Then hide, quickly!

187
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:51,552
You know better than to keep me waiting.

188
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:55,624
Give me what you owe us so I can be on my way.

189
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:59,103
Well? Is there a problem?

190
00:14:59,144 --> 00:15:02,204
No, right this way.

191
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:05,405
The deal's off!

192
00:15:05,466 --> 00:15:06,939
The Avatar!

193
00:15:06,984 --> 00:15:08,658
Aang, don't get involved!

194
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:13,786
If I don't get what I came for the Fire Nation will burn this place to rubble!

195
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,793
Get out of here!

196
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:18,419
You're leaving empty handed!

197
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:23,233
Then the destruction of this temple will be on your head.

198
00:15:32,377 --> 00:15:34,294
This is bad! Very bad!

199
00:15:34,351 --> 00:15:38,244
Aang, what are we gonna do? How can we possibly keep them all away?

200
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:41,222
I'll tell ya how. We have something they don't.

201
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:44,088
Air power! We control the sky.

202
00:15:44,147 --> 00:15:47,940
That' something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!

203
00:15:48,003 --> 00:15:50,347
I want to help.

204
00:15:50,786 --> 00:15:53,852
Good, we'll need it.

205
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,014
We finally got the war balloon working, thanks to Sokka.

206
00:15:58,094 --> 00:15:59,572
This boy's a genius!

207
00:15:59,589 --> 00:16:01,698
Thank you. You're a genius!

208
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,344
Thank you!

209
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,661
See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it airborne,...

210
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:09,274
...but once you did, it just kept going.

211
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:12,581
You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape.

212
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:16,725
So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?

213
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,826
Ugh, if only we knew.

214
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,939
A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon.

215
00:16:25,995 --> 00:16:28,708
Hmm. That's actually pretty smart.

216
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:33,548
Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs. Smoke, slime, fire and...

217
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:38,618
...stink. Never underestimate the power of stink!

218
00:16:43,912 --> 00:16:45,320
They're coming!

219
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,559
Are we ready?

220
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:49,552
Yes, but where's Sokka with the war balloon?

221
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,996
We'll have to start without him.

222
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:36,388
Take them out of the sky, now!

223
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,859
We've got'em on the run! We need more slime!

224
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,390
Those things are unstoppable!

225
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:39,297
I think I know how they work.

226
00:19:39,331 --> 00:19:42,516
I remember my Dad tinkering with the counterbalancing system.

227
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:45,555
Something to do with water. Works great, huh?

228
00:19:45,622 --> 00:19:48,115
Water? Can you get me close to one?

229
00:19:48,148 --> 00:19:50,125
No problem!

230
00:20:30,121 --> 00:20:31,665
We're out of bombs!

231
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:36,395
Come on, Sokka, where's that war balloon?

232
00:20:44,227 --> 00:20:46,920
Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?

233
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,186
The insignia! They think we're on their side!

234
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:52,316
Then I guess they won't see this coming.

235
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:55,292
Bomb away!

236
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:05,303
Oh no! That was the last one!

237
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,964
Wait a second, you smell that?

238
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,355
Rotten eggs!

239
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,244
There! That's where the gas is escaping!

240
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:21,093
What are you doing!? That's our fuel source!

241
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:24,061
It's the only bomb we've got!

242
00:21:44,296 --> 00:21:45,862
Look! They're retreating!

243
00:21:45,903 --> 00:21:47,499
Yeh!!!

244
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,911
We're going down!

245
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:52,136
No! Sokka! Hold on!

246
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:54,184
Get ready!

247
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:12,915
You know what? I'm really glad you guys all live here now.

248
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:16,733
It's like the hermit crab, maybe you weren't born here,...

249
00:22:16,781 --> 00:22:19,749
...but you found this empty shell and made it your home.

250
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:21,683
And now you protect each other.

251
00:22:21,754 --> 00:22:24,541
That means a lot coming from you.

252
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,774
Aang, you were right about air power.

253
00:22:26,805 --> 00:22:31,892
As long as we've got the skies we'll have the Fire Nation on the run!

254
00:22:45,403 --> 00:22:51,249
This defeat is the gateway to many victories.

00:00:31,251 --> 00:00:33,356

15
00:00:55,328 --> 00:01:00,730
I'm not one to complain, but can't Appa fly any higher?

16
00:01:01,412 --> 00:01:06,584
I have an idea, why don't we all get on your back and you can fly us to the North Pole?

17
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:13,152
I'd love to! Climb on everyone, Sokka's ready for takeoff!

18
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:16,398
Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky...

19
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:18,863
...because we've been flying for two days straight.

20
00:01:18,927 --> 00:01:22,190
And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe.

21
00:01:22,247 --> 00:01:24,927
There's nothing up here.

22
00:01:41,744 --> 00:01:45,839
They're waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!

23
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,020
He's heading north. The Northern Water Tribe.

24
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:57,987
The Avatar needs to master waterbending. He's looking for a teacher.

25
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:00,872
Then what are we waiting for? Let's go get him!

26
00:02:00,935 --> 00:02:06,580
Patience, Captain Li. This isn't some little Earth village we can just march into.

27
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:08,884
The Water Tribe is a great nation.

28
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:12,246
There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of war.

29
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:17,171
The frozen tundra is treacherous. The landscape itself is an icy fortress.

30
00:02:17,247 --> 00:02:21,458
We'll need a massive invasion force.

31
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,897
There it is!

32
00:02:25,943 --> 00:02:28,783
The Northern Water Tribe...

33
00:02:28,843 --> 00:02:31,534
We're finally here...

34
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:54,222
I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!

35
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:58,269
We'll find a master to teach us, no problem!

36
00:03:37,441 --> 00:03:40,123
This place is beautiful.

37
00:03:40,167 --> 00:03:43,164
Yeh, she is.

38
00:03:55,181 --> 00:04:06,107
â« Winter, spring, summer and fall. Winter, spring, summer and fall. â«

39
00:04:06,169 --> 00:04:18,502
â« Four seasons, four loves. Four seasons, four loves. â«

40
00:04:39,183 --> 00:04:45,918
Tonight, we celebrate the arrival of our brother and sister from the Southern Tribe,...

41
00:04:45,973 --> 00:04:49,317
...and they have brought with them someone very special,...

42
00:04:49,352 --> 00:04:54,963
...someone whom many of us believed disappeared from the world until now.

43
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:57,552
The Avatar!

44
00:05:00,284 --> 00:05:05,048
We also celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday.

45
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:09,522
Princess Yue is now of marrying age.

46
00:05:09,592 --> 00:05:10,573
Thank you, father.

47
00:05:10,649 --> 00:05:15,702
May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits watch over us during these troubled times.

48
00:05:15,754 --> 00:05:20,910
Now, Master Pakku and his students will perform!

49
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:42,953
Hi, there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.

50
00:05:42,992 --> 00:05:45,814
Very nice to meet you.

51
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,789
So... uh... you're a Princess, huh?!

52
00:05:51,847 --> 00:05:55,381
You know, back in my tribe, I'm kinda like a Prince myself!

53
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:57,290
Ha! Prince of what?

54
00:05:57,345 --> 00:06:01,153
A lot of things! Uh, do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here!

55
00:06:01,204 --> 00:06:04,316
My apologies, Prince Sokka.

56
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:07,941
So it looks like I'm gonna be in town for awhile.

57
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:12,105
I'm thinking maybe we could... do an activity together?

58
00:06:12,159 --> 00:06:14,959
Do an "activity"?

59
00:06:18,784 --> 00:06:20,662
Very smooth.

60
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:25,352
Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar.

61
00:06:25,402 --> 00:06:31,655
Just because you're destined to save the world, don't expect any special treatment.

62
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:34,514
My friend and I can't wait to start training with you...

63
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:36,692
...after we relax for a couple days.

64
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,759
If you want to relax, then I suggest visiting a tropical island.

65
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:46,718
If not, I'll see you both at sunrise. Good night.

66
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:53,731
For the last time, I'm not playing the sumki horn.

67
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:59,883
No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem.

68
00:07:01,718 --> 00:07:02,967
I'm taking your crew.

69
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:04,092
What!?

70
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:07,679
I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.

71
00:07:07,715 --> 00:07:09,390
Uncle, is that true?

72
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:14,634
I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone. Even the cook!

73
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:18,155
Sorry you won't be there to watch me capture the Avatar.

74
00:07:18,224 --> 00:07:22,987
But I can't have you getting in my way again.

75
00:07:39,954 --> 00:07:43,581
I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko.

76
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:47,912
I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative.

77
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:51,197
Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?

78
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:54,734
Just rumors. I don't think he is real.

79
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:59,877
He's real all right. He's a criminal, an enemy of the Fire Nation.

80
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:03,363
But I have a feeling that justice will catch up with him soon.

81
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:09,888
General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands if you change your mind.

82
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:15,904
I've waited for this day my whole life!

83
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,022
I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!

84
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,289
Good morning, Master Pakku!

85
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,417
No, please, march right in, I'm not concentrating or anything.

86
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:33,754
Uhh... this is my friend, Katara, the one I told you about?

87
00:08:33,797 --> 00:08:37,121
I'm sorry. I think there's been a misunderstanding.

88
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:39,488
You didn't tell me your friend was a girl.

89
00:08:39,543 --> 00:08:46,246
In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending.

90
00:08:52,036 --> 00:08:54,319
What do you mean you won't teach me?

91
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:58,371
I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me "no"!

92
00:08:58,418 --> 00:08:59,319
No.

93
00:08:59,382 --> 00:09:02,417
But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!

94
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:06,803
Here the women learn from Yugoda to use their waterbending to heal.

95
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:11,463
I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student despite your bad attitude.

96
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:13,587
I don't want to heal, I want to fight!

97
00:09:13,644 --> 00:09:17,902
I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules.

98
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:19,553
Well your rules stink!

99
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:23,761
Yeh! They're not fair. If you won't teach Katara, then...

100
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:24,934
Then what?

101
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:26,969
Then I won't learn from you!

102
00:09:27,022 --> 00:09:30,942
Well have fun teaching yourself. I'm sure you'll do a great job.

103
00:09:30,994 --> 00:09:34,629
Wait! Aang didn't mean that.

104
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,855
You can't risk your training for me.

105
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,599
You have to learn from Master Pakku. Even if he is a big jerk.

106
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:47,537
Why don't we get started then?

107
00:09:48,954 --> 00:09:52,898
Princess Yue! Good morning!

108
00:09:52,917 --> 00:09:55,300
Hey, how about that picnic last night?

109
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,782
Boy, your Dad sure knows how to throw a party.

110
00:09:57,836 --> 00:09:59,861
I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.

111
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,872
Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left.

112
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:07,536
So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other.

113
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:09,749
Do an "activity", you mean?

114
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:13,729
Yes! At... a place! For... some time!

115
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:17,220
I'd love to! I'll meet you on that bridge tonight.

116
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:20,488
Great! I'll see you... aahh!

117
00:10:21,296 --> 00:10:23,028
Sorry!

118
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:27,819
That's okay, it was worth it. See you tonight.

119
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:30,781
I'm very impressed.

120
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:36,366
You all seem highly qualified for the mission I have in mind.

121
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,382
That's some tasty gold!

122
00:10:40,434 --> 00:10:42,390
What do you need us to do?

123
00:10:42,439 --> 00:10:46,600
I believe you're acquainted with Prince Zuko?

124
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,415
Um, hi. Are you Yugoda?

125
00:10:56,485 --> 00:11:00,234
Are you here for the healing lesson?

126
00:11:02,807 --> 00:11:04,110
I guess I am.

127
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:08,536
Welcome! Welcome!

128
00:11:13,008 --> 00:11:17,938
You're moving the water around, but you're not feeling the push and pull.

129
00:11:17,987 --> 00:11:20,851
I'm trying!

130
00:11:22,617 --> 00:11:29,492
Maybe that move is too advanced for you. Why don't you try an easier one?

131
00:11:32,475 --> 00:11:34,395
Thanks for the lesson.

132
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:36,276
So, who's the lucky boy?

133
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:36,951
Huh?

134
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:40,936
Your betrothal necklace. You're getting married, right?

135
00:11:40,963 --> 00:11:44,370
Ah, no, I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

136
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,654
My grandmother gave my mother this necklace,...

137
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:49,643
...and my mother passed it down to me.

138
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:55,122
I recognize this carving! I don't know why I didn't realize sooner!

139
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:57,587
You're the spitting image of Kana!

140
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:00,727
Wait, how do you know my Gran Gran's name?

141
00:12:00,749 --> 00:12:05,015
When I was about your age I was friends with Kana.

142
00:12:05,054 --> 00:12:08,155
She was born here, in the Northern Tribe.

143
00:12:08,198 --> 00:12:09,863
She never told me.

144
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:13,778
Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender.

145
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:16,153
He carved that necklace for her.

146
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:19,362
If Gran Gran was engaged, why did she leave?

147
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:26,645
I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye.

148
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:28,992
Good luck!

149
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:33,229
The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.

150
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,278
Good riddance to those traitors.

151
00:12:35,342 --> 00:12:39,095
It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me?

152
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:42,347
It would clear your head.

153
00:12:43,425 --> 00:12:47,310
Or, just stay in your room and sit in the dark.

154
00:12:47,389 --> 00:12:51,425
Whatever makes you happy.

155
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,454
Careful with the blasting jelly!

156
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:28,361
Uncle? Uncle, is that you?

157
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,763
Zuko!

158
00:14:19,104 --> 00:14:21,773
Zuko...

159
00:14:31,634 --> 00:14:37,341
Hi, Princess Yue. I made you something. I carved it myself.

160
00:14:37,403 --> 00:14:38,475
It's a bear.

161
00:14:38,523 --> 00:14:43,664
Actually, it's suppose to be a fish, see it has a fin.

162
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:52,452
Oh. I'm sorry! I made a mistake. I shouldn't have asked you to come here!

163
00:14:58,557 --> 00:15:02,038
How's warrior training going?

164
00:15:02,071 --> 00:15:03,099
That bad?

165
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:05,952
No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it.

166
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:10,080
One minute she wants to go out with me and the next she's telling me to get lost!

167
00:15:10,126 --> 00:15:12,385
So how's waterbending training?

168
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:16,436
Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.

169
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,902
Why don't you just teach her, Aang?

170
00:15:18,962 --> 00:15:21,111
Why didn't I think of that?

171
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:24,682
At night, you can teach me whatever moves you learned from Master Pakku.

172
00:15:24,739 --> 00:15:28,210
That way you have someone to practice with and I get to learn waterbending.

173
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:29,777
Everyone's happy!

174
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,292
I'm not happy.

175
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:34,946
But you're never happy. Come on, Aang!

176
00:15:38,945 --> 00:15:45,021
Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.

177
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:48,249
I got it!

178
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:49,902
That was amazing!

179
00:15:49,969 --> 00:15:52,961
That wasn't me.

180
00:15:53,021 --> 00:15:55,548
I... I was just showing Katara a few moves.

181
00:15:55,595 --> 00:16:00,033
You have disrespected me, my teachings, and my entire culture.

182
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:01,148
I'm sorry, I...

183
00:16:01,205 --> 00:16:05,945
You are no longer welcome as my student.

184
00:16:11,147 --> 00:16:16,710
What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang back as his student?

185
00:16:16,771 --> 00:16:18,690
Yes... please!

186
00:16:18,742 --> 00:16:27,699
I suspect he might change his mind if you swallow your pride and apologize to him.

187
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:30,565
Fine.

188
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:33,405
I'm waiting, little girl.

189
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:39,715
No! No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!

190
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:41,054
Uh, Katara...

191
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:44,864
I'll be outside... if you're man enough to fight me!

192
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:49,858
I'm sure she didn't mean that.

193
00:16:49,923 --> 00:16:52,805
Yeh, I think she did.

194
00:16:53,482 --> 00:16:59,648
I'm devastated to hear about Prince Zuko. Just devastated.

195
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:04,590
The Fire Lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible.

196
00:17:04,655 --> 00:17:07,400
You know who... was behind the attack?

197
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:13,411
Yes... pirates! We had a run in with them awhile back.

198
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:16,242
They wanted revenge.

199
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:20,335
So, have you reconsidered my offer?

200
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:28,172
Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your general. To the Fire Nation!

201
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,306
To victory!

202
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:36,340
Are you crazy, Katara? You're not gonna win this fight!

203
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:38,164
I know! I don't care!

204
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:41,542
You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.

205
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:46,880
I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!

206
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:50,645
So, you decided to show up?

207
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,621
Aren't you gonna fight?

208
00:17:53,696 --> 00:17:58,773
Go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong.

209
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:07,511
Fine. You want to learn to fight so bad, study closely!

210
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:19,533
Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you!

211
00:18:37,297 --> 00:18:39,416
You can't knock me down!

212
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,406
Go Katara!

213
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:26,681
Well, I'm impressed. You are an excellent waterbender.

214
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:28,961
But you still won't teach me, will you?

215
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:30,994
No.

216
00:19:54,647 --> 00:19:56,664
This fight is over.

217
00:19:56,704 --> 00:19:58,914
Come back here! I'm not finished yet!

218
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:02,128
Yes, you are.

219
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:05,952
This is my necklace!

220
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:08,634
No it's not, it's mine! Give it back!

221
00:20:08,685 --> 00:20:15,483
I made this sixty years ago... for the love of my life. For Kana.

222
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:19,825
My Gran Gran was supposed to marry you?

223
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:29,794
Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.

224
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:31,350
You didn't have to do this.

225
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,416
No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup!

226
00:20:36,468 --> 00:20:38,329
Thank you, Uncle.

227
00:20:38,397 --> 00:20:40,485
Someone's coming!

228
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:48,460
Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours! Good luck!

229
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:53,804
I carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged.

230
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:59,094
I thought we would have a long, happy life together. I loved her.

231
00:20:59,137 --> 00:21:04,337
But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage.

232
00:21:04,399 --> 00:21:08,315
Gran Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life.

233
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:14,031
That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage.

234
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:17,362
Go get her.

235
00:21:23,312 --> 00:21:25,368
What do you want from me?

236
00:21:25,433 --> 00:21:29,337
Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful...

237
00:21:29,383 --> 00:21:32,523
...and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.

238
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:34,195
You don't understand.

239
00:21:34,232 --> 00:21:38,741
No, no, see, that's the thing. I think I do understand now.

240
00:21:38,812 --> 00:21:43,096
You're a princess, and I... I'm just a southern peasant.

241
00:21:43,141 --> 00:21:44,620
No, Sokka...

242
00:21:44,665 --> 00:21:51,383
It's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'll see ya around, okay?

243
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:58,709
Okay, now I'm really confused! Happy... but confused!

244
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:05,736
I do like you! A lot. But, we can't be together... and not for the reason you think.

245
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:10,317
It's because... I'm engaged.

246
00:22:11,418 --> 00:22:13,618
I'm sorry!

247
00:22:23,179 --> 00:22:25,723
Not bad! Not bad! Heheh!

248
00:22:25,783 --> 00:22:31,047
Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age!

249
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,272
Hey Katara!

250
00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:39,362
What do you think you're doing? It's past sunrise. You're late.

251
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,597
Good to see ya here.

252
00:22:40,653 --> 00:22:42,778
You too.

253
00:22:50,195 --> 00:22:56,847
My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe.

00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,496
<i>Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.</i>

6
00:00:13,497 --> 00:00:17,575
<i>Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

7
00:00:17,776 --> 00:00:21,888
<i>Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them.</i>

8
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:25,048
<i>But when the world needed him most, he vanished.</i>

9
00:00:25,389 --> 00:00:29,210
<i>A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar...</i>

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,050
<i>...an airbender named Aang.</i>

11
00:00:31,151 --> 00:00:33,256
<i>And although his airbending skills are great.</i>

12
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:36,989
<i>He has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

13
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,612
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

Book One: Water | Chapter Nineteen:
The Siege of the North Part 1

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,871
Nice try, Pupil Sangok.

16
00:01:14,912 --> 00:01:20,100
A couple of more years and you might be ready to fight a sea sponge.

17
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:26,758
Would anyone care for a rematch with Katara?

18
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:32,330
Katara, you have advanced more quickly than any student I have ever trained.

19
00:01:32,366 --> 00:01:35,050
You have proven that with fierce determination,...

20
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:39,516
...passion and hard work you can accomplish anything.

21
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:42,412
Raw talent alone is not enough.

22
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:43,323
Pupil Aang!

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,625
Yes, Master Pakku?

24
00:01:44,683 --> 00:01:47,571
Care to step into the sparring circle?

25
00:01:47,644 --> 00:01:50,379
I figure since you've found time to play with house pets...

26
00:01:50,394 --> 00:01:53,202
...you must have already mastered waterbending.

27
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:57,604
I wouldn't say "mastered", but check this out!

28
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:09,074
So they don't have palaces in the Southern Tribe?

29
00:02:09,138 --> 00:02:15,744
Are you kidding? I grew up in a block of ice. It's not exactly a cultural hub.

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,267
Sokka, this is wrong.

31
00:02:19,327 --> 00:02:21,699
What's wrong? We're taking a walk!

32
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:25,968
I'm engaged. It just... feels...

33
00:02:26,014 --> 00:02:29,133
I know what you need! You need to meet my good friend Appa!

34
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,094
Who?

35
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:34,045
Appa and I go way back. Don't we boy?

36
00:02:34,106 --> 00:02:35,894
Ahh! Easy!

37
00:02:35,954 --> 00:02:38,255
Down boy! Ahh! No! Up!

38
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:42,213
Looks like you haven't been giving Appa enough attention.

39
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,495
So how does this work?

40
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,887
You hangin' on tight?

41
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,004
Mmm hmm.

42
00:02:48,044 --> 00:02:50,876
Yip... yip!

43
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:53,896
Oh... my... goodness!

44
00:02:55,414 --> 00:02:59,179
Wow! I can't believe you do this every day!

45
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:01,370
Yeh, we pretty much live up here.

46
00:03:01,414 --> 00:03:04,670
Is it always this cold in the sky?

47
00:03:05,107 --> 00:03:08,207
Not when you're with someone.

48
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,989
It's beautiful up here.

49
00:03:10,007 --> 00:03:11,650
Yeh.

50
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:21,808
Whoo! Yeh! Huh... Good times! Good times!

51
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:23,883
Hey, look!

52
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:26,095
What's happening?

53
00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:28,498
Oh no.

54
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:52,624
Soot.

55
00:03:52,688 --> 00:03:53,039
What?

56
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:58,894
I've seen it before. Right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow.

57
00:03:58,952 --> 00:03:59,758
But why?

58
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:03,442
It's the Fire Nation. They've closed in on the North Pole.

59
00:04:03,475 --> 00:04:05,305
And from the looks of the stuff...

60
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:08,016
...I'd say there's a lot of them.

61
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:14,710
This will truly be one for the history books, General Iroh.

62
00:04:14,772 --> 00:04:19,533
Just think, centuries from now, people will study the great Admiral Zhao...

63
00:04:19,577 --> 00:04:23,251
...who destroyed the last of the Water Tribe civilization.

64
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,229
You're lucky you're here to see it.

65
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:31,794
Be careful what you wish for, Admiral. History is not always kind to its subjects.

66
00:04:31,831 --> 00:04:34,645
I suppose you speak from experience?

67
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:40,686
But rest assured, this will be nothing like your legendary failure at Ba Sing Se.

68
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:43,311
I hope not, for your sake.

69
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,653
Tell the Captains to prepare for first strike.

70
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,617
We'll be landing soon. Do you have a plan?

71
00:04:57,653 --> 00:05:00,590
I'm working on it, Uncle.

72
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:12,167
What's wrong? We have to go!

73
00:05:12,193 --> 00:05:16,241
No, Sokka, wait. I can't see you anymore. Not at all.

74
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,855
What? We're just friends.

75
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,788
I wish we could just be friends,...

76
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:24,798
...but I like you too much and it's too confusing to be around you.

77
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:27,638
I'm marrying someone else.

78
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:31,422
You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him.

79
00:05:31,459 --> 00:05:33,456
But I do love my people.

80
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,071
You're not marrying them.

81
00:05:36,112 --> 00:05:40,413
You don't understand. I have duties to my father, to my tribe.

82
00:05:40,438 --> 00:05:43,817
I have to do this, goodbye!

83
00:05:46,131 --> 00:05:53,258
The day we have feared for so long has arrived. The Fire Nation is on our doorstep.

84
00:05:53,282 --> 00:05:58,178
It is with great sadness I call my family here before me,...

85
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:05,157
...knowing well that some of these faces are about to vanish from our tribe.

86
00:06:05,204 --> 00:06:09,116
But they will never vanish from our hearts.

87
00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:17,243
Now, as we approach the battle for our existence, I call upon the great spirits!

88
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:23,294
Spirit of the Ocean! Spirit of the Moon! Be with us!

89
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,424
I'm going to need volunteers for a dangerous mission.

90
00:06:27,448 --> 00:06:28,605
Count me in.

91
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:29,881
Sokka!

92
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,753
Be warned. Many of you will not return.

93
00:06:33,805 --> 00:06:39,959
Come forward to receive my mark if you accept the task.

94
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:10,904
The stillness before battle is unbearable. Such a quite dread.

95
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:14,490
I wasn't there when the Fire Nation attacked my people.

96
00:07:14,529 --> 00:07:17,729
I'm gonna make a difference this time.

97
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,316
Yip! Yip!

98
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:10,514
Katara!?

99
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:35,126
I'll take it from here, boy!

100
00:09:43,908 --> 00:09:45,938
Appa!

101
00:09:48,911 --> 00:09:51,380
Thanks for the rescue, buddy!

102
00:10:11,685 --> 00:10:14,902
You have got to be kidding me.

103
00:10:16,196 --> 00:10:19,980
Men, you'll be infiltrating the Fire Nation navy.

104
00:10:20,015 --> 00:10:25,074
That means you'll all need one of these uniforms...

105
00:10:29,792 --> 00:10:31,220
What's your problem?

106
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,840
Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.

107
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:39,452
Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers.

108
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:41,916
When, like a hundred years ago?

109
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,554
Eighty five.

110
00:10:43,624 --> 00:10:45,862
The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore.

111
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,848
The newer uniforms are more streamlined.

112
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:53,366
How do we know we can trust this guy? Such bold talk for a new recruit.

113
00:10:53,422 --> 00:11:00,464
Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn, he is a capable warrior and I value his input.

114
00:11:00,548 --> 00:11:06,314
Now, our first objective is to determine the identity of their commanding officer.

115
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:11,818
His name is Zhao. Middle-aged. Big sideburns. Bigger temper.

116
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:17,478
Sokka, I want you to tell everything you know to Hahn, he is leading this mission.

117
00:11:17,515 --> 00:11:25,922
Hahn, show Sokka your respect. I expect nothing less from my future son-in-law.

118
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,719
Princess Yue's marrying you?

119
00:11:27,748 --> 00:11:29,401
Yeh, what of it?

120
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:32,733
Nothing, congratulations.

121
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:40,732
Stop those fireballs!

122
00:11:49,229 --> 00:11:51,367
It's almost twilight, Admiral.

123
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:55,588
As your military consultant I must advise you to halt your attack.

124
00:11:55,636 --> 00:12:00,808
The waterbenders draw their power from the moon and it is nearly full tonight.

125
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:04,078
You should wait and resume the attack at daybreak.

126
00:12:04,124 --> 00:12:09,001
Oh, I'm well aware of the moon problem and I am working on a solution.

127
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:12,821
But for now, daybreak it is.

128
00:12:18,834 --> 00:12:20,322
They've stopped firing.

129
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,486
Aang!

130
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:31,186
I can't do it. I can't do it.

131
00:12:31,216 --> 00:12:32,057
What happened?

132
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:34,771
I must have taken out a dozen Fire Navy ships,...

133
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:39,098
...but there's just too many of them. I can't fight them all.

134
00:12:39,117 --> 00:12:42,381
But, you have to! You're the Avatar!

135
00:12:42,396 --> 00:12:45,808
I'm just one kid.

136
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:56,752
If you're fishing for an octopus, my nephew,...

137
00:12:56,782 --> 00:13:03,149
...you need a tightly woven net or he will squeeze through the tiniest hole and escape.

138
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:05,441
I don't need your wisdom right now, Uncle.

139
00:13:05,472 --> 00:13:12,335
I'm sorry, I just nag you because, well, ever since I lost my son...

140
00:13:12,393 --> 00:13:14,939
Uncle, you don't have to say it.

141
00:13:14,989 --> 00:13:18,670
I think of you as my own.

142
00:13:19,572 --> 00:13:23,089
I know, Uncle. We'll meet again...

143
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,796
...after I have the Avatar.

144
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:33,153
Remember your Breathe of Fire! It could save your life out there!

145
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:34,420
I will.

146
00:13:34,468 --> 00:13:37,520
And put your hood up, keep your ears warm!

147
00:13:37,571 --> 00:13:39,656
I'll be fine.

148
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,552
Let me tell ya, Sokka, I've courted a lot of girls,...

149
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:54,294
...but Yue is the finest... and she comes with the most perks.

150
00:13:54,327 --> 00:13:56,506
Perks!? What does that mean?

151
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,749
I mean, Yue's nice and everything,...

152
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,072
...but the points I'll get with the Chief aren't bad either.

153
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:04,948
Princess Yue is wasted on a self absorbed weasel like you!

154
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:07,628
Whoa. Hang on. What do you care?

155
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,209
You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe.

156
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:15,985
What would you know of the political complexities of our life? No offense.

157
00:14:18,285 --> 00:14:22,637
You're just a jerk without a soul! No offense!

158
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:28,478
That's enough! Sokka, you're off the mission.

159
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:30,378
All right, fall in men!

160
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:35,137
Everybody listen to what I say and we'll take out this Admiral Jo in no time.

161
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:37,875
It's Admiral Zhao!

162
00:15:12,725 --> 00:15:15,317
Where are they going?

163
00:15:16,763 --> 00:15:19,940
They're coming up for air somewhere...

164
00:15:28,132 --> 00:15:30,953
The legends say the moon was the first waterbender.

165
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:33,614
Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides...

166
00:15:33,645 --> 00:15:35,576
...and learned how to do it themselves.

167
00:15:35,617 --> 00:15:39,434
I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.

168
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:42,048
Our strength comes from the Spirit of the Moon,...

169
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:47,812
...our life comes from the Spirit of the Ocean. They work together to keep balance.

170
00:15:47,862 --> 00:15:51,702
The Spirits! Maybe I can find them and get their help!

171
00:15:51,744 --> 00:15:53,225
How can you do that?

172
00:15:53,266 --> 00:15:56,794
The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World.

173
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,496
Aang can talk to them!

174
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:01,485
Maybe they'll give you the wisdom to win this battle!

175
00:16:01,527 --> 00:16:06,916
Or, maybe they'll unleash a crazy amazing spirit attack on the Fire Nation!

176
00:16:07,277 --> 00:16:09,269
Or wisdom. That's good too.

177
00:16:09,299 --> 00:16:13,350
The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident.

178
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,124
How are you going to get there this time?

179
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,837
I have an idea, follow me.

180
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,988
So is this the way to the Spirit World?

181
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:29,573
No, you'll have to get there on your own.

182
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:34,857
But I can take you to the most spiritual place in the entire North Pole.

183
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:53,454
I never thought I'd miss grass this much!

184
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:56,522
It's so warm here! How is that possible?

185
00:16:56,542 --> 00:17:00,805
It's the center of all spiritual energy in our land.

186
00:17:09,092 --> 00:17:16,626
You're right, Yue. I can feel... something... it's so... tranquil.

187
00:17:33,826 --> 00:17:35,861
Be quiet!

188
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,222
Is something wrong, Sokka?

189
00:17:57,265 --> 00:17:59,840
Oh no! Hahn's out there on the top secret mission...

190
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:03,445
...while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine!

191
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:07,580
Listen to me. I took you off the mission for selfish reasons.

192
00:18:07,621 --> 00:18:10,893
I have a special task in mind for you.

193
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:12,705
What? You want me to scrub the barracks?

194
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:17,029
I want you to guard my daughter, Princess Yue.

195
00:18:17,075 --> 00:18:21,905
Er, sure. That shouldn't be too hard.

196
00:19:13,797 --> 00:19:15,861
Why is he sitting like that?

197
00:19:15,882 --> 00:19:19,550
He's meditating... trying to cross over into the Spirit World.

198
00:19:19,596 --> 00:19:22,210
It takes all his concentration.

199
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,726
Is there any way we can help?

200
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:29,850
How 'bout some quiet!? C'mon guys! I can hear every word you're saying!

201
00:19:49,308 --> 00:19:50,420
Is he okay?

202
00:19:50,477 --> 00:19:55,056
He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body.

203
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,201
That's his way back to the physical world.

204
00:19:57,244 --> 00:19:58,516
Maybe we should get some help?

205
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:03,049
No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.

206
00:20:03,075 --> 00:20:06,067
Well, aren't you a big girl now?

207
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,037
No!

208
00:20:07,068 --> 00:20:11,750
Yes! Hand him over, and I won't have to hurt you.

209
00:20:22,465 --> 00:20:27,528
I see you've learned a new trick. But I didn't come this far to lose to you.

210
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:52,054
You little peasant. You've found a master, haven't you?

211
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:30,384
It's daybreak at last. Let's write history.

212
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:56,441
You rise with the moon. I rise with the sun.

213
00:22:07,122 --> 00:22:15,051
The Water Tribe can try to resist the inevitable, but their city will fall today.

214
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,945
Aang!

215
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,413
What happened? Where's Zuko?

216
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:30,754
He took Aang. He took him right out from under me.

217
00:22:30,803 --> 00:22:33,036
Where did they go?

218
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,858

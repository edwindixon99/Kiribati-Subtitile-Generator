5
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,150
How you doing, Keaton?

6
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,450
I can't feel my legs...

7
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,450
Keyser.

8
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,850
Ready?

9
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,850
What time is it?

10
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,450
12:30.

11
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,950
It all started back in New York
six weeks ago.

12
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,650
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

13
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,150
The driver didn't see anyone,
but someone fucked up.

14
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,850
He heard a voice.
Sometimes that's all you need.

15
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,950
- Mr.McManus?
- Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?

16
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,250
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

17
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,550
Todd Hockney?

18
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,150
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

19
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,550
- Shit.
- Freeze!

20
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,950
Hold it!

21
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,750
Sure you brought enough guys?

22
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,650
It's quite simple:

23
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,550
A restaurant that changes with the taste
without losing the overall aesthetic.

24
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,850
In other words...

25
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,050
...the atmosphere will not
be painted on the walls.

26
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,250
- Let me give you an example--
- This I had to see for myself.

27
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,850
David.

28
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,150
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

29
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,750
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

30
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,850
Special Agent Kujan. US Customs.

31
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,750
These gentlemen
are from the New York Police Department.

32
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,750
You look good.
Better than I would have thought.

33
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,750
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

34
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,750
Mr.Keaton?

35
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,350
Will you excuse us for a moment?

36
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,350
We have some questions
to ask you downtown. You'll be a while.

37
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,450
No. Please, sit down.

38
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,950
This is a small problem.

39
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,150
Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.

40
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,550
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

41
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,350
These guys were hard-core hijackers...

42
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,350
...but there I was.

43
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,950
At that point, I wasn't scared.

44
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,950
I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.

45
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,650
Besides, it was fun.

46
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,550
I got to make like I was notorious.

47
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,050
You all know the drill.

48
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,850
When your number is called, step forward
and repeat the phrase you've been given.

49
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,250
Number 1, step forward.

50
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,850
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

51
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,650
Number 2, step forward.

52
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,150
Gimme the fuckin' keys,
you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker!

53
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,850
Knock it off. Get back.
Number 3, step forward.

54
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,350
- "Hand me the keys, you cocksucker."
- In English, please.

55
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,450
- Excuse me?
- In English.

56
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,250
Hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker.
What the fuck?

57
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,250
Number 4, step forward.

58
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,250
It was bullshit.
The whole rap was a setup.

59
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,550
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

60
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,350
It was the cops' fault.

61
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,550
You don't put guys like that
into a room together.

62
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,750
Who knows what can happen?

63
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,250
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

64
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,450
This has really got to be embarrassing
for you guys.

65
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,750
They drilled us all night.

66
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,150
Someone was mad about that truck
hijacking and the cops had nothing.

67
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,450
They were hoping somebody would slip up
and give them something.

68
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,450
They knew we wouldn't fight,
they knew how to lean on us.

69
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,650
They've been doing it forever.
Our rights went out the window.

70
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,650
It was a violation. Disgraceful.

71
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,550
They went after McManus first.
Topnotch entry man.

72
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,050
What truck?

73
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,550
- The truck with the guns, fucko.
- "Fucko"?

74
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,050
He was a good guy. Crazy, though.

75
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,150
Wanna know what your pal
Fenster told us?

76
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,950
- Say who?
- McManus.

77
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,750
He told us another story.

78
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,550
Is that the one about
the hooker with the dysentery?

79
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,850
Fenster always worked with McManus.
He was a real tight-ass.

80
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,150
But when it came to the job,
he was right on. A smart man.

81
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,950
- What are you saying?
- I said he'll flip you.

82
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,050
- He'll what?
- Flip you. Flip you for real.

83
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,450
- I'm shaking. Come on.
- Okay.

84
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,550
- Answer my questions.
- Can you hear me in the back?

85
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,650
Hello?

86
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,850
I want my lawyer.

87
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,750
I'm gonna have
your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.

88
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,650
Todd Hockney: good with explosives.

89
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,750
Without a doubt, the one guy
who didn't give a fuck about anybody.

90
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,350
You guys don't have
a fuckin' leg to stand on.

91
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,650
You think so, tough guy?

92
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,250
I can put you in Queens
during the hijacking.

93
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,550
Really?

94
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,350
I live in Queens.

95
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,750
Did you put that
together yourself, Einstein?

96
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,450
You got a team of monkeys
working full time on this?

97
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,850
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

98
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,950
I fuck your father in the shower,
and have a snack.

99
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,350
- Are you gonna charge me, dickhead?
- I'll charge you when I'm ready.

100
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,150
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

101
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,250
But Keaton?

102
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,050
Keaton was the real prize for them
for obvious reasons.

103
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,850
It was your mistake, not mine.

104
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,550
Did you ever stop to ask me?

105
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,150
I've been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

106
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,050
I'm a businessman.

107
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,250
What's that? The restaurant business?

108
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,250
No. From now on you're in the
"getting fucked by us" business.

109
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,750
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

110
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,450
Like I said...

111
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,850
...it was your mistake...

112
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,450
...not mine.

113
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,250
You charge me with this shit...

114
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,150
...and I'll beat it.

115
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,150
Okay?

116
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,950
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

117
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,450
Really, somebody's got to do something
about this shit.

118
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,950
They put me in holding every five minutes.
So I did a little time.

119
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,450
Does that mean I get railed every time
a truck finds it's way gone?

120
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,850
Fuck 'em.

121
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,150
Fenster, will you relax?

122
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,650
- These guys don't have any probable cause.
- You fuckin' right. No PC.

123
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,250
You're goddamn right.
You do some time, never let you go.

124
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,750
They treat me like a criminal.

125
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,850
- I'll end up a criminal.
- You are a criminal.

126
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,850
Why'd you got to go and do that?

127
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,650
- I'm trying to make a point.
- Why don't you make your point?

128
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,950
You're making me tired all over.

129
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,150
Fuck it then.

130
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,050
- I heard you were dead.
- Yeah?

131
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,350
- You heard right.
- Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

132
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,850
- What's that all about?
- What's this?

133
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,750
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.
I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.

134
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,850
Who's that?

135
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,550
She's a heavyweight criminal
lawyer from uptown.

136
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,550
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

137
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,550
How 'bout it, Keaton?

138
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,450
You a lawyer's wife?

139
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,150
What kind of retainer you giving her?

140
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,750
Do your friend a favor...

141
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,150
...tell him to keep quiet.

142
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,650
Dean Keaton...

143
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,750
Gone clean?

144
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,850
Say it ain't so.

145
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,450
- Or was it you that hit that truck?
- Mac, forget him.

146
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,050
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

147
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,550
This whole thing was a shakedown.

148
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,350
- What makes you say that?
- How many times you been in a lineup?

149
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,750
It's always you and four dummies.

150
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,050
The PD are paying homeless guys
$10 a head half the time.

151
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,550
There's no way they'd line
five felons in the same row.

152
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,450
What's a voice lineup?
Public defender could get you out of that.

153
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,050
- Why the hell was I strip searched?
- It was the feds.

154
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,650
A truckload of guns gets snagged.

155
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,450
Customs comes down on NYPD
for answers. They come up with us.

156
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,850
- They're clutching at straws.
- I had a guy's finger up my ass.

157
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,250
Is it Friday already?

158
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,550
Yeah, lover boy.

159
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,850
You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.

160
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,650
So who in the goddamn piss hell
stole our fucking truck?

161
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,650
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

162
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,850
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, workingman?

163
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,650
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is, who's the gimp?

164
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,050
- He's okay.
- Says you. How do I know that?

165
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,150
What about it, pretzel man?
What's your story?

166
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,550
His name is Verbal.

167
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,650
Verbal Kint.

168
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,150
- Verbal?
- Yeah.

169
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,350
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.

170
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,550
I was going to tell you to shut up.

171
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,350
- We met before, once or twice.
- In County. I was in for fraud.

172
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,650
You were in a lineup then, too.
What happened?

173
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,650
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

174
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,750
- So you did it.
- All right, now look...

175
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,850
...we've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

176
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,750
I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

177
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,550
Now, me and Fenster
heard about a little job.

178
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,450
Why don't you just calm down?

179
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,850
What do you care what he has to say?

180
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,850
I'm just talking here.

181
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,350
It seems to me like Mr.Hockney
wants to hear it...

182
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,350
...and I know Fenster's down.

183
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,950
What about you, guy?

184
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,750
I'm interested.

185
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,250
There. See?

186
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,650
I'd like to exercise my right
to free assembly.

187
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,650
Why don't you just shut up?

188
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,250
You're missing the point.

189
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,050
No.

190
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,050
You're missing the point.

191
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,750
I don't want to hear anything from you.

192
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,250
I don't care about your job.

193
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,250
And...

194
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,950
...I want nothing to do with any of you.

195
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,650
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

196
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,650
Dean Keaton...

197
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,850
...gone the high road.

198
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,550
What is the world coming to?

199
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,750
Fuck him.

200
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,150
And that was how it started:

201
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,650
Five of us brought in
on a trumped-up charge...

202
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,650
...to be leaned on by half-wits.

203
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,450
I really can't talk about it much here.

204
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,150
What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now...

205
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,450
...was that these men would never break,
never lie down.

206
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,450
Never bend over for anybody.

207
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,650
Anybody.

208
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,850
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, FBI.

209
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,150
- How many dead?
- 15 so far.

210
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,050
They're still pulling bodies
out of the water.

211
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,150
- Any survivors?
- Two.

212
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,050
One guy's in County hospital,
but he's in a coma.

213
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,150
The DA has a second guy,
a cripple from New York.

214
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,650
The chief wants this place sealed off.

215
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,550
If you have any questions, give him a call.

216
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,950
This is Dave Kujan.
I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.

217
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,250
If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin
of the San Pedro Police Department...

218
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,150
...at extension 112. Have a nice day.

219
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,550
- Why can't I see him?
- I told you...

220
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,550
...the DA came down here
last night ready to arraign...

221
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,750
...even before they moved him to County.

222
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,150
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later...

223
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,750
...the DA comes out looking like
the bogeyman smacked him around.

224
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,950
They take his statement,
and they cut him a deal.

225
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:37,050
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Weapons, misdemeanor 2.

226
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,850
What is that?

227
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,050
I give the DA credit for getting that much,
you understand?

228
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,650
Excuse me, sir.

229
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,850
This whole thing has turned political.
The mayor was here last night.

230
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,250
The chief. This morning,
the governor called, okay?

231
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,550
I'm telling you, this guy is protected
from up on high by the Prince of Darkness.

232
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,050
- Take my word for it.
- When does he post bail?

233
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,350
- Maybe two hours, tops.
- I want to see him.

234
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,250
- No.
- I gotta see him.

235
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,950
- No. I can't--
- You gotta do this for me.

236
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,250
I came a long way for this.

237
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,450
Dave, please.

238
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,750
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

239
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,150
He's paranoid about being recorded.

240
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,750
- He knows the rooms are wired.
- I quit.

241
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,850
This won't be an interrogation,
just a friendly chat.

242
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,150
- He won't go into the interrogation room.
- Then someplace else.

243
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,350
Where?

244
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,650
No, no.

245
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,550
If this was a dope deal, where's the dope?
If it was a hit, who called it?

246
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,150
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories
to answer all these questions.

247
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,550
- You know what I think.
- That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter.

248
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,450
The guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

249
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,050
- He doesn't know what you want to know.
- I don't think he does, not exactly.

250
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,050
But there's a lot more to his story,
believe me.

251
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,050
I wanna know why
27 men died on that pier...

252
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,450
...for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

253
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,050
And above all,
I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

254
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,850
He's dead.

255
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,250
Come on. Two hours.
Just till he makes bail.

256
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,050
They're all dead.

257
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,450
I don't care how tough
you say Keaton was...

258
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,450
...nobody on that boat
could've come out alive.

259
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,650
- Is he talking?
- He regained consciousness an hour ago.

260
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,150
He spoke, not English, then he lapsed.

261
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,750
- Hungarian?
- That might have been it.

262
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,750
- Most of them were Hungarians.
- You gotta put this on.

263
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,450
Burn victims are very susceptible
to infection.

264
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,450
And, of course, there's no smoking.

265
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,750
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

266
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,950
Is he gonna die?

267
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,750
He's burned 60 percent of his body,
broken ribs--

268
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,450
Call security. Put a man on the door.

269
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,650
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

270
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,050
Do it.

271
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,050
Do it now.

272
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,550
Joel? Baer. Down at LA County.

273
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,650
Look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor
is Arkosh Kovash.

274
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,550
Yes, I'm sure.

275
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,750
No, he's all fucked up.

276
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,250
I can't hear you.

277
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,950
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

278
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,550
Yes.

279
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,450
No, not till I put a man on him.

280
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,950
Send me someone
who can speak Hungarian.

281
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,850
He's awake.
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

282
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,250
Keyser Soze.

283
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,850
- What?
- Keyser Soze!

284
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,950
No shit?

285
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,250
Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

286
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,850
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

287
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,150
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

288
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,450
Nice to meet you.

289
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,050
He wants to ask you a few questions
before you go.

290
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,650
- What about?
- About a Dean Keaton, mostly.

291
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,350
I'd like to start at the lineup
back in New York.

292
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,750
- Can I get some coffee?
- In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.

293
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,250
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

294
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,650
Once I got so bad
my piss come out like snot.

295
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,750
- It was all thick and gooey--
- I'll get your fucking coffee.

296
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,350
Get me one, too, while you're at it.

297
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,450
That guy is tense.

298
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,350
Tension is a killer.

299
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,450
I used to be in a barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

300
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,450
The baritone was this guy
named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.

301
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,150
Like, orca fat.
He was so stressed in the morning--

302
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,250
- You know we're trying to help you.
- Sure, and I appreciate that.

303
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,450
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.
I like cops.

304
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,150
I would've liked to have been a fed,
but my CP--

305
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,150
You're not tellin' us everything.
I know you know something.

306
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,350
I told the DA everything I know.

307
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,650
I know you like Keaton.

308
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,850
- I know you think he's a good man.
- I know he was good.

309
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,350
He was a corrupt cop.

310
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,150
Sure. 15 years ago,
but he was a good thief.

311
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,850
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.

312
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,050
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

313
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,950
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?

314
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,850
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

315
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,450
May I have a cigarette?

316
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,550
- According to your statement--
- I need a light.

317
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,950
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

318
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,650
...run-of-the-mill--

319
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,450
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

320
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,750
...run-of-the-mill scams.

321
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,650
It's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.

322
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,050
I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

323
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,650
I do have the weapons charge.
I'm lookin' at six whole months hard time.

324
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,850
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

325
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,350
You know a religious guy
named John Paul?

326
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,550
- You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

327
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,550
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.

328
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,050
He's a good friend of mine,
likes me very much.

329
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,150
I know your testimony is sealed.
Ruby's well connected.

330
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,950
He's got lots of friends inside
who do favors for him.

331
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,850
What would he say if he found out
you dropped his name to the DA?

332
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,650
- There's nothing there on Ruby.
- I'll be sure to mention that to him.

333
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,750
Know what I've learned on the job?
How to spot a murderer.

334
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,150
Say you arrest three guys
for the same killing.

335
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,750
Put them in jail overnight.

336
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,150
Next morning,
whoever's sleeping is your man.

337
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,850
If you're guilty, you know you're caught.
You let your guard down.

338
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,150
- You follow me?
- No.

339
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,850
Let me get to the point.

340
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,850
I'm smarter than you,
and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

341
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,250
I'll get it, whether you like it or not.

342
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,950
I'm not a rat.

343
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,550
Thanks.

344
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,650
When I was pickin' beans in Guatemala
we used to make fresh coffee.

345
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,750
Right off the trees, I mean. That was good.

346
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,650
- This is shit, but I'm in a police station.
- Can we get started again?

347
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,950
What happened after the lineup?

348
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,850
The desk sergeant was telling me
he couldn't release you.

349
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,150
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged.

350
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,550
Damn police.

351
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,750
I wanna have pictures taken of your face.

352
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,950
- I'll take them to the DA tomorrow.
- Forget about it.

353
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,750
I'll have this thing in front
of a grand jury by Monday.

354
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,750
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

355
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,550
What did Fortier and Renault say?

356
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,750
They asked for more time
to think about investing.

357
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,850
Damn it.

358
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,550
More time for what?

359
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,550
No matter how you cover my tracks
they're still gonna find out about me.

360
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,750
Give me some credit.

361
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,350
I got you this far.
Let's go to the grand jury.

362
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,550
- This isn't gonna stop if we don't--
- It's never going to stop, period.

363
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,350
By next week, every investor in the city
is gonna be walking away from us.

364
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,250
It's finished.

365
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,950
I'm finished.

366
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,750
Don't give up on me now.

367
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,850
It's never gonna stop.

368
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,450
I love you.

369
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,850
They ruined me in there tonight.

370
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,150
I love you.

371
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,950
Do you hear me?

372
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,250
What?

373
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,150
All right.

374
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,250
Let's just go to my place.

375
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,550
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

376
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,250
Let's go.

377
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,450
Fenster and McManus
had a cagey proposition:

378
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,050
A fast-jump, high-risk, long money.

379
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,250
We all knew it could be done.

380
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,150
The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.

381
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,550
To do it right took five men.

382
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,850
Five men meant Keaton.

383
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,050
Keaton took convincing.

384
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,750
New York's finest taxi service.

385
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,850
Bullshit.

386
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,950
Bullshit.

387
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,150
They don't operate anymore.

388
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,550
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct.
They're coming out for one job, Thursday.

389
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,550
They're pickin' up a guy
smuggling emeralds from South America.

390
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,450
McManus already has a fence set up.

391
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,450
- A fence? Who?
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.

392
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,450
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

393
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,050
- What's it to you whether I do it or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

394
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,650
They won't take me unless you go.

395
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,750
Look at me. I need this.

396
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,050
You're telling me you don't need this?
Is this your place?

397
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,950
I'm not knocking you. You got
a good scam going with this lawyer.

398
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,850
Sorry.

399
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,750
It's okay.

400
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,650
You say it's the real thing? That's cool.

401
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,450
You okay?

402
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,550
I was out of line.

403
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,250
But they're never gonna stop with us.
You know that.

404
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,050
As clean as you get,
they'll never let you go now.

405
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:41,150
This way, we hit the cops where it hurts,
and we get well in the meantime.

406
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,650
You sure you're okay?

407
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,650
I'll be all right.

408
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,550
Look, I...

409
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,750
- ...sometimes get--
- Forget it.

410
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,550
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

411
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,750
So...

412
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,350
...how do they wanna do it?

413
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,550
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

414
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,350
Fenster? Hockney?

415
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,250
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

416
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,750
I got a way to do it without killing anyone.

417
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,050
But like I say,
they won't let me in without you.

418
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,550
$3 million?

419
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,950
Maybe more.

420
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,950
No killing.

421
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,450
Not if we do it my way.

422
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,650
New York's finest taxi service
was not your normal taxi service.

423
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,650
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD
that ran a high-profit racket...

424
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,250
...driving smugglers and drug dealers
all over the city.

425
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,950
For $300 a mile,
you got your own blue and white...

426
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,050
...and a police escort.
They even had their own business cards.

427
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,350
After a while, somebody started asking
questions, and the taxi service shut down.

428
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,050
Ever since then, Internal Affairs
has been waiting to catch them in the act.

429
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,750
That's where we came in.

430
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,250
- So, how was the flight?
- Fuckin' great.

431
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,550
Will this get me to Staten Island?

432
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,050
Are you kiddin' me?
This will get you to Cape Cod.

433
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,050
McManus came to us with the job.
Fenster got the vans.

434
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,750
Hockney supplied the hardware.

435
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,450
I came through with
how to do it so no one got killed.

436
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,150
But Keaton?
Keaton put on the finishing touch.

437
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,850
A little "fuck you" from the five
of us to the NYPD.

438
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,350
Watch this.

439
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,550
Careful.

440
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,550
Come on, asshole!

441
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,250
Holy shit!

442
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,350
- Don't move, you fucker!
- Drop it now, motherfucker!

443
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,550
Drop the fuckin' gun! Drop it!

444
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,650
Don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing.

445
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,350
- What do you guys want?
- Put your fuckin' thing away.

446
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,450
We're cops! Stupid assholes!

447
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,150
- Watch the glass!
- Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker!

448
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,550
- You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?
- Shut up!

449
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,550
Fuck.

450
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,550
'Afternoon, my little pork chops.
Give me the shit.

451
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,250
- Don't move!
- Give him the shit!

452
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,350
Give him the fuckin' thing!

453
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,250
Give him the fuckin' shit, man!

454
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,650
Hurry up! Come on!

455
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,950
- Now the money!
- There's no money.

456
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,050
- Give me the money now!
- There's no fuckin' money.

457
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,750
Give him the fuckin' money!

458
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,450
- Do it! Give him the money!
- Give me the money!

459
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,950
- Give him the money!
- Hurry up!

460
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,950
You know who the fuck I am?

461
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,850
You people know
who the fuck I am? Fuck!

462
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,250
We do now, jerk-off.

463
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,350
Cocksucker.

464
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,150
Wait a minute. What's that?

465
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,650
What the fuck?

466
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,550
Holy shit!

467
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,250
Go!

468
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,150
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.

469
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,850
The press was on the scene
before the police were.

470
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,350
Strausz and Rizzi
were indicted three days later.

471
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,250
Within a few weeks,
50 more cops went down with them.

472
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:38,250
Everybody got it right in the ass,
from the chief on down.

473
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,950
It was beautiful.

474
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,650
I owe you $2.50.

475
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,650
Dr.Keaton.

476
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,950
- There's more here than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

477
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,950
Redfoot never comes to see me.
I always go to see him.

478
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,850
In California?

479
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,750
Yes, Verbal, in California. Fenster and I--

480
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,850
Wait, hold the fuckin' phone.
You and Fenster? No.

481
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,150
- You fuckin' kiddin' me?
- So then, who's gonna go?

482
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,250
We all go.

483
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,350
What's your fuckin' problem, man?

484
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:27,050
My problem, is you and Fenster
honeymooning in California...

485
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,150
...while the rest of us are sittin' here
holding our dicks.

486
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,850
The job's over.

487
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,650
Cool it.

488
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,950
LA's a good place to lay low for a while.

489
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,050
You wanna dance?

490
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,850
Ladies.

491
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,650
I would like to propose a toast.

492
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,550
There you go.

493
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,650
To Mr.Verbal...

494
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,350
...the man with the plan.

495
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,050
We're gonna miss the flight.

496
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,250
Don't do this.
Send her a note. Something.

497
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,850
I said we'll make it.

498
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,850
We're gonna miss the plane.

499
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,750
She'll understand.

500
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,350
That's heartwarming. Really.

501
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,250
I'm weepy.

502
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,450
You wanna wait outside?

503
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,850
You guys wanted to know what happened.
I'm telling you.

504
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,350
Come on, Verbal.

505
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,450
Who do you think you're talkin' to?
You expect me to believe that he retired?

506
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,850
For a woman?

507
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,350
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

508
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,050
- He loved her.
- Sure.

509
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,550
I'm supposed to believe that hitting
the taxi service wasn't his idea.

510
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,450
- It was all Fenster and McManus.
- Keaton was a cop for four years.

511
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,350
Who else would know better?

512
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,250
- That job had his name on it.
- Edie had him turned around.

513
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,550
Let me tell you something.

514
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,250
I know Dean Keaton.

515
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,150
I've been investigating him
for the past three years.

516
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,750
The guy I know
was a cold-blooded bastard.

517
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:28,350
IAD indicted him on three counts of
murder before he was kicked off the force.

518
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,750
Don't sell me the hooker
with a heart of gold.

519
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,350
You got him all wrong.

520
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,650
Do I?

521
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,550
Dean Keaton was under indictment
seven times while he was on the force.

522
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,150
In every case,
witnesses either reversed their testimony...

523
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,150
...or died before they could testify.

524
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:51,250
When they finally did nail him for fraud,
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

525
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,350
He killed three prisoners inside.

526
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,150
Of course, I can't prove this...

527
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,050
...but I can't prove the best part either.

528
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,050
Dean Keaton was dead.

529
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,350
Did you know that?

530
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,350
He died in a fire two years ago,
during an investigation into the murder...

531
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,550
...of a witness who was going
to testify against him.

532
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,650
Two people saw Dean Keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned...

533
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,550
...just before it blew up.

534
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,050
They said he went in
to check a leaking gas main.

535
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,850
It blew up and took all
of Dean Keaton with it.

536
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:31,050
Within three months of the explosion,
the two witnesses, they were dead.

537
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,550
One killed himself in his car.

538
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,650
The other fell down an open elevator shaft.

539
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,850
Let's get this show on the road.

540
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,650
This is not what we discussed.
There are too many--

541
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,550
I promise we'll be out
before he blows his porch light.

542
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,050
- I have a noon meeting.
- Five minutes.

543
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,950
Everyone calm down, all right?

544
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,450
I want you to ask this man
about the shootout in the harbor.

545
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,150
- He says they were buying--
- Dope. We know.

546
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,850
He doesn't know
what they were buying, but not dope.

547
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,250
- People.
- What?

548
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,950
He needs guarantees...

549
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,250
- What is he talking about, guarantees?
- He says his life is in danger.

550
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,350
He saw the Devil.

551
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,350
Looked him in the eye.

552
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,050
- I'm on my way.
- No, wait a minute.

553
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,650
Ask him to tell him what he told me...

554
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,150
...about the Devil.

555
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,150
Who's the Devil?

556
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,750
Keyser Soze.

557
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,050
Keyser Soze?

558
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,950
He was in the harbor, killing many men.

559
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,550
He saw Keyser Soze?

560
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,350
- He saw his face.
- All right.

561
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,350
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

562
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,250
Describe him.

563
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,350
Six weeks ago,
I get an anonymous phone call...

564
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,450
...telling me I can find Keaton
eating at Mondino's, and there he is.

565
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,250
Because he never profited
from his alleged death...

566
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,850
...and we convicted someone else
of the murder we tried to pin on him...

567
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,950
...we had to let him go.

568
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,750
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over.

569
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,550
And then he had lunch.

570
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,950
I don't know about that.

571
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,750
I don't think you do,
but you say you saw Keaton die.

572
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:59,550
I think you're covering his ass,
and he's still out there.

573
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,950
I think he's behind
that circus at the harbor.

574
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:05,550
My bet is he's using you because
you're stupid and think he's your friend.

575
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,850
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

576
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,150
I wanna be sure
before I go back to New York.

577
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,150
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

578
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,050
What lawyer?

579
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,950
What lawyer?

580
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,750
Back when I was in
that barbershop quartet--

581
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,250
You don't think I know you held out
on the DA?

582
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,950
What did you leave out?

583
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,350
I could be on the phone
to Ruby in 10 minutes.

584
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:30,050
- The DA gave me immunity.
- Not from me.

585
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,650
You get no immunity from me,
you piece of shit.

586
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,250
Every criminal I have put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor...

587
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,950
...every creep and scumbag
that walks the street...

588
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,650
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.
You talk to me...

589
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,250
...or that precious immunity
they grant you...

590
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:48,650
...won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

591
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,450
There was a lawyer.

592
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,150
Kobayashi.

593
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:00,550
- Is he the one that killed Keaton?
- No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead.

594
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,950
Convince me.

595
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,850
Tell me every last detail.

596
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,650
We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.

597
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:33,250
He had a good reputation.
Seemed like a good guy.

598
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,550
- Still, we should have known better.
- How you doing?

599
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,650
- Good. You?
- Not bad. Can't complain.

600
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,450
How's it going, Fenster?

601
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,450
Don't need to open it, right?

602
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,050
You must be Keaton.

603
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,950
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

604
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:00,150
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.
- Verbal, the man with the plan.

605
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,550
You interested in more work?

606
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,350
- We're always looking for extra work.
- We're on vacation.

607
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,350
That's too bad.

608
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,950
I got a ton of work and no good people.

609
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,350
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job?

610
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,450
There's this jeweler
out of Texas named Saul.

611
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,650
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.

612
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,350
He does free appraisals.
Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

613
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,150
The word is,
he carries around a lot of cash.

614
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,050
So I figure, I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

615
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,850
- Simple.
- What about security?

616
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,250
A couple of bodyguards.
Nothing you couldn't handle.

617
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,250
Give me time to check it out?

618
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,750
I expect nothing less from you, man.

619
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,150
Good to see you. We'll call you.

620
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,650
Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.

621
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:57,050
A friend in New York tells me
that you knew Spook Hollis.

622
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,150
The way I hear it,
you did time with ol' Spook.

623
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,050
A good man, wasn't he?

624
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,450
I used to run dope for him.

625
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,250
Too bad he got shivved.

626
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,450
I shivved him.

627
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,550
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else later.

628
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,650
I appreciate that.

629
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,550
But just out of curiosity...

630
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,750
...was it business or personal?

631
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,650
A bit of both.

632
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,950
Like I said...

633
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:37,150
...you give me a call if you're interested.

634
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,050
Is there a problem?

635
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:45,950
One job.

636
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,050
That was the deal.

637
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,550
One job?

638
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:58,850
One job?

639
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,450
That's a good one.

640
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:08,250
Keaton fought it as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.

641
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,550
He can convince anyone he's someone else,
but never himself.

642
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,250
It took one day with McManus nagging,
and we went back to work.

643
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,450
I get out of my car,
and the thing is wrecked.

644
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:36,050
I look in the backseat of the other car,
and this woman's totally naked.

645
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,250
- I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

646
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:42,150
- Freeze, motherfucker!
- Stay right there!

647
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,950
There's a second one here, somewhere.

648
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,950
Gimme the case. Give me the fuckin' case!

649
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,550
Give me the fuckin' case.
I'm tellin' you for the last time.

650
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,550
Give me the fuckin' case!

651
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,550
- Come on!
- Don't move!

652
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,650
Hand over the case.

653
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,850
Hand over the fuckin' case.

654
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,450
Come on, let's go!

655
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,650
- Come on!
- Bad day. Fuck it.

656
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:22,950
Let's go!

657
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:48,250
Fuck.

658
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:55,050
- Looks like a lot of china to me.
- Shit.

659
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:01,850
Guys, come on.

660
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,650
- What are you doin'?
- I'm gonna kill him.

661
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,850
We did it your way, now we'll do it mine.

662
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,150
- You gonna kill him?
- I'll deal with him.

663
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,050
- You'd better, or I'm gonna.
- Shut up.

664
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,850
What am I supposed to do with that?

665
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,350
Feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain.
I don't know what that is.

666
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,450
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

667
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,750
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.

668
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:31,850
Who?

669
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,150
I don't know. Some limey.

670
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,950
He's a middleman for somebody.
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

671
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,250
- You're fuckin' full of shit!
- Fuck you.

672
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,050
- Fuck you.
- Listen to me.

673
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,450
We wanna meet him, okay?

674
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,250
That's funny.

675
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,650
He called me last night.
He says he wants to meet you guys.

676
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:53,250
Okay, we'll meet him.

677
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,550
- I'll call you.
- Good. Let's go.

678
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,950
I don't like it. Wait a minute.
One more thing, tough guy:

679
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:02,250
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.

680
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:06,650
You're such a tough guy.
But do me a favor, all right?

681
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,850
Get the fuck off my dick.

682
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,750
No!

683
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,650
Put a leash on that puppy.

684
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,050
It's an awful shame
about Saul gettin' whacked.

685
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,850
Cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it.

686
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,550
Sooner or later,
they're gonna come around askin' me.

687
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,250
You have a sweet night, ladies.

688
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,350
Fuck you.

689
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:44,550
- So this lawyer--
- Kobayashi.

690
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,650
- Came from Redfoot.
- Right.

691
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,850
And why leave this out
when you talked to the DA?

692
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,950
Dave, someone to see you.

693
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,450
I've been looking all over for you.

694
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:04,150
You still after that coke that took a walk
out of that bloodbath yesterday?

695
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,050
You can stop looking. There was no coke.

696
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,750
I've been in LA County talking to a guy
they pulled out of a drainpipe...

697
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,650
...yesterday after the shootout.

698
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,850
He came to this morning,
he started talking.

699
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,250
He's part of a Hungarian mob.
They dealt with gwats from Argentina.

700
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,850
He says it was definitely not a dope deal.

701
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:24,250
- But there were--
- We know. But he says no on the dope.

702
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,850
This Hungarian tells me they were
pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

703
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:31,450
They had no time for that kind of product,
and no means to move it.

704
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,550
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

705
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,850
No one doing the deal knew
except for a few key people.

706
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,250
They were all very hush about it, he says.

707
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:43,650
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
- I don't get it.

708
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,050
You got the cripple in there
from New York?

709
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,650
Did he mention Keyser Soze?

710
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,250
Who?

711
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,750
Just bear with me here.

712
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,950
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Fuck!

713
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:00,150
We've been goin' over this
for an hour and a half.

714
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:04,450
What we need to do is find Redfoot
and get the hell out of here now.

715
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,550
What we need to do is think.

716
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,250
Think back.

717
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:12,150
Somebody with power...

718
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:15,850
...somebody capable of tracking us
from New York to LA.

719
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,950
- What the hell are we doing here?
- We're waiting.

720
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,450
- Sit down.
- No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored.

721
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,250
Mr.Hockney, do stay.

722
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,350
Mr.Keaton.

723
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,050
Mr.Fenster I recognize
from his mug shots...

724
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,950
...as well as Mr.McManus.

725
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:37,050
I can only assume that you are Mr.Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

726
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,850
My employer sends his gratitude,
a most unexpected benefit.

727
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,750
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

728
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:48,650
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

729
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,850
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services.

730
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:57,550
One job, one day's work. Very dangerous.

731
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:01,150
He does not expect all of you to live.
But those of you who do...

732
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:05,350
...will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

733
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,150
Who's your boss?

734
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,050
I work for Keyser Soze.

735
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,650
Who's Keyser Soze?

736
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,050
Judging by the sudden change in mood...

737
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,150
...I feel sure the rest
of your associates can tell you.

738
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:32,250
I come with an offer
directly from Mr.Soze.

739
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:36,250
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean, "an order"?

740
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:41,450
In 1981, you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

741
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:45,650
The cargo was raw steel,
steel which belonged to Mr.Soze...

742
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,850
...and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

743
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:53,150
A most profitable violation
of UN Regulations.

744
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,350
You had no way of knowing this...

745
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:58,550
...because the fellow shipping the steel
was working for Soze...

746
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,250
...without his knowledge.

747
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:03,250
Earlier this year,
Mr.Fenster and Mr.McManus...

748
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:07,050
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight
out of Newark airport.

749
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:11,450
The plane was carrying gold and platinum
wiring also set for Pakistan.

750
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:15,550
Two months ago,
Mr.Hockney stole a truck...

751
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:18,150
...carrying gun parts through Queens.

752
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,850
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed
by the state of New York.

753
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,850
They were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to Belfast.

754
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,950
Again, Mr.Soze using pawns
who had no knowledge.

755
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,450
Which brings us to Mr.Kint.

756
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,150
Nine months ago, one of Mr.Soze's...

757
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:39,850
...less than intelligent couriers was taken
in a complicated confidence scam...

758
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:41,950
...by a cripple.

759
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,650
He was relieved of $62,000.

760
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,350
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

761
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:52,650
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

762
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,150
You set up the lineup.

763
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,550
Yes. You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

764
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:00,450
It seems Mr.Keaton's attorney,
Miss Finneran...

765
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:04,350
...was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

766
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,550
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

767
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,550
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

768
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,350
Mr.Soze rarely works
with the same people for long...

769
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:15,250
...and they never know
who they're working for.

770
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,250
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

771
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,250
So, why are you telling us?

772
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:25,850
Because you have stolen from Mr.Soze,
Mr.Fenster.

773
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,150
All of you.

774
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,850
That you did not know it
is the only reason you're still alive.

775
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:35,150
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

776
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:39,450
Fuck the debt, and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Soze?

777
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,450
I don't think that is very relevant.

778
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:45,850
All five of you are responsible
for the murder of Saul Berg...

779
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,250
...and his bodyguards.

780
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,050
Mr.Redfoot can testify
to your involvement.

781
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,050
We can see to it that he will.

782
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,250
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen:

783
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,650
Mr.Soze's primary interest...

784
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,450
...is narcotics.

785
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,350
He has been competing, shall we say...

786
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,850
...with a group of Argentineans
for several years.

787
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:07,950
Competing with Mr.Soze has taken its toll.

788
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,350
These Argentineans
are negotiating the sale...

789
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:15,250
...of $91 million in cocaine
in three days time.

790
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:18,450
Needless to say,
this purchase will revitalize...

791
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:21,250
...the diminishing strength
of their organization.

792
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,350
Mr.Soze would like you to stop the deal.

793
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,250
If you choose,
you may wait until after the buy.

794
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,950
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

795
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:37,650
Mr.Soze would like you to get to the boat
and destroy the cocaine onboard.

796
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:42,250
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr.Soze.

797
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:48,250
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

798
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,750
A gift from Mr.Soze.

799
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,750
Good day, gentlemen.

800
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:10,150
They got my whole life in here,
everything I've done since I was 18.

801
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,550
They fuckin' know everything.

802
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,450
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

803
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:30,950
No.

804
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,450
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.

805
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,650
Who's that guy who used
to talk about Soze in New York?

806
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:44,450
- Bricks Marlin.
- He did jobs for him, indirect stuff.

807
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:48,850
He said he always made five times
more money on it than the job was worth.

808
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,150
This guy's a pipe dream.

809
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,450
Kobayashi's using him
for window dressing.

810
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,550
I don't know. This is bad.

811
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:59,850
It's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fuckin' setup.

812
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,650
The way I hear it,
Soze's some kind of butcher.

813
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:08,250
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
- There is no Keyser Soze!

814
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,650
Who is Keyser Soze?

815
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:17,650
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

816
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,750
Nobody ever believed he was real.

817
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,150
Nobody knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him.

818
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:26,350
To hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could have worked for Soze.

819
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,550
You never knew. That was his power.

820
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:33,250
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...

821
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,650
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

822
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,750
One story the guys told me,
the story I believe...

823
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,550
...was from his days in Turkey.

824
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,550
There was a gang of Hungarians
that wanted their own mob.

825
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:49,050
They realized that to be in power,
you didn't need guns...

826
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,650
...or money or even numbers.

827
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,150
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

828
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:57,950
After a while they come into power,
and then they come after Soze.

829
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:01,350
He was small-time then.
Just running dope, they say.

830
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,050
They come to his home...

831
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:08,050
...in the afternoon looking for his business.

832
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:12,350
They find his wife and kids in the house,
and decide to wait for Soze.

833
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:32,450
He comes home to find his wife raped
and children screaming.

834
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,850
The Hungarians knew Soze was tough,
not to be trifled with.

835
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,650
They let him know they meant business.

836
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,350
No!

837
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:46,650
They tell him they want his territory,
all his business.

838
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:50,550
Soze looks over the faces of his family.

839
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:55,950
Then he showed these men
of will what will really was.

840
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:18,450
He tells them he would
rather see his family dead...

841
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:21,150
...than live another day after this.

842
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,750
He lets the last Hungarian go...

843
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:28,950
...waits until his family is in the ground,
and goes after the rest of the mob.

844
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:31,950
He kills their kids, he kills their wives...

845
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,350
...he kills their parents and their friends.

846
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:37,050
He burns down the houses they live in...

847
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,950
...and the stores they work in.

848
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:44,050
He kills people that owe them money.
And like that...

849
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,150
...he's gone, underground.

850
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,850
Nobody's ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.

851
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:53,050
A spook story that criminals
tell their kids at night.

852
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:56,250
"Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Soze will get you."

853
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,150
No one ever really believes.

854
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,450
Do you believe in him?

855
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,650
Keaton always said:

856
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:09,350
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him."

857
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,250
I believe in God.

858
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:17,650
And the only thing that scares me
is Keyser Soze.

859
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,550
You give any weight to this?

860
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,050
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser
from Justice.

861
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:32,750
He's got a file on Soze in DC.
It's been a hobby of his for a while.

862
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,250
A lot of guys equate him to that reporter
on The Incredible Hulk.

863
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:42,750
You've heard of him?

864
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:44,650
Where? On the street?

865
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,450
A few times. You know, outside stuff.

866
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:51,750
Someone working for a guy who worked
for a guy who got money from Soze.

867
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:53,450
Shit like that.

868
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,550
It could be an old badge. A hex sign.

869
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:59,650
Keep people from fucking with you
when a name meant something.

870
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,650
- But you're here.
- Shit, yeah.

871
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:06,550
This guy's trying to walk out of a hospital
because he's so afraid of Soze.

872
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,950
I'll run it up the flagpole.

873
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,850
I came clean. I told it like it happened.

874
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:14,450
So what about how I got there?

875
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:17,750
It's so full of holes, the DA would've
told me to forget amnesty.

876
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:20,050
You got what you wanted out of me.
Big deal.

877
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:22,950
- That's why you never told the DA?
- You tell me.

878
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:26,350
If I told you the Loch Ness monster
hired me, what would you say?

879
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,750
Turn state's evidence.
We'll put you on the stand.

880
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,250
I've got immunity.
What can you possibly offer me?

881
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,950
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come lookin' for you.

882
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:36,750
Where's your head?

883
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,150
Where do you think the pressure is?

884
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:42,350
Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him,
knows where I am right now.

885
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:46,650
He has the burner on your ass to let me go
so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.

886
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,950
Immunity was just a deal
with you assholes.

887
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:50,950
I got a new problem when I post bail.

888
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:53,450
Why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

889
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:57,850
Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.
Extortion, coercion.

890
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:00,050
Pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

891
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:03,450
The same fuckers that rounded us up
are now bailing me out?

892
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:05,250
Fuck you.

893
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,550
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

894
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:12,750
You think a guy like that
comes this close to getting caught...

895
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,350
...and sticks his head out?

896
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:17,250
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

897
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,150
After that...

898
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:22,550
...my guess is you'll never hear
from him again.

899
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,250
What happened next?

900
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:49,150
We woke up the next morning
and Fenster was gone.

901
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,750
He couldn't handle the idea
of slumming for Soze.

902
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,950
He left us a note wishing us good luck...

903
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:56,750
...and took a chunk of the money
we'd scraped together.

904
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:57,950
Then what?

905
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,650
McManus was furious.

906
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:03,950
He talked about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit.

907
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,850
That night, we got the call.

908
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,450
What call?

909
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,050
Kobayashi told us where
we could find Fenster.

910
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,550
Let's get the fuck out of here.

911
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:24,650
We gotta bury him.

912
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:26,150
With what?

913
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,150
With our hands.

914
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,450
This is nuts.

915
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:41,650
It's dry fucking sand.

916
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,250
When he rots the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

917
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,350
- Dig, you fuck.
- What are we gonna do?

918
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:49,350
This fuckin' guy is gonna kill us.

919
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:53,250
I don't know about you, peg leg,
but I can run. I got no problem with that.

920
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:57,350
Kobayashi doesn't seem
to have a problem with it either.

921
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,050
You run, and we're gonna be
diggin' a hole for you.

922
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:02,650
You got that?

923
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,650
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!

924
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:11,150
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for five years.

925
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,850
We did more jobs and I saw more money
than you can ever count.

926
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:16,350
So fuck you!

927
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:20,050
- 'Cause now it's payback!
- It's not payback!

928
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:24,350
It's precaution.

929
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,750
You want payback? You wanna run?
I don't care.

930
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,950
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.

931
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,650
I'm not doin' it for you.

932
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:39,050
I'm doin' this for me.

933
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,750
I'm gonna finish this thing.

934
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:46,650
This Kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

935
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,950
After they killed Fenster,
nobody would run?

936
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:14,050
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
- Why didn't you say anything?

937
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:16,750
Believe me, I tried,
but Keaton wouldn't have it.

938
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:18,850
It was too far-fetched for him.

939
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:21,150
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.

940
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:24,150
To a cop, the explanation
is never that complicated.

941
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,850
It's always simple.

942
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:28,550
There's no mystery to the street,
no arch-criminal.

943
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:32,350
You got a body and think
his brother did it, you're probably right.

944
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,950
Nobody argued with Keaton.

945
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,650
They just set their minds
to whacking Kobayashi.

946
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:47,950
They're coming up.

947
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:53,850
- Did you hear me? He's coming up.
- He's on his way down.

948
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:51,950
Don't move.

949
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:54,350
Press 20. Do it now.

950
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,750
Move.

951
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:22,050
- The answer is "no."
- Mr.Soze will be most--

952
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:24,350
Listen, cocksucker,
there is no Keyser Soze.

953
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,950
Mention his name again,
I'll kill you right now.

954
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:30,850
A strange threat. I assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

955
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:38,750
We know that you can get to us...

956
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:42,450
...but now you know
that we can get to you.

957
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:46,050
I'm giving you one last
chance to call this off.

958
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,550
My employer has made up his mind.

959
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:52,750
- He does not change it.
- Neither do we.

960
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:55,750
You got Fenster,
but you won't be able to get all of us.

961
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,150
Not before one of us gets through to you.

962
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:01,350
I believe you. I most sincerely do.

963
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,950
You would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable.

964
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:08,950
But I cannot make this decision.
Whatever you threaten me with is...

965
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:11,850
...ludicrous in comparison
to what will be done to me...

966
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:14,550
...if I do not carry out my orders in full.

967
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:24,550
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

968
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,450
I just wanted you to know that.

969
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,350
I'm so sorry.

970
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:34,350
I implore you, believe me...

971
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,750
...Mr.Soze is very real...

972
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,650
- ...and very determined.
- We'll see.

973
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:50,450
Before you do me in...

974
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:54,850
...you will let me finish my business
with Miss Finneran first, won't you?

975
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:01,350
What did you say?

976
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:04,050
Edie Finneran.

977
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:06,350
She's upstairs in my office...

978
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:09,150
...for an extradition deposition.

979
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:12,950
I requested she be
put on the case personally.

980
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,850
She flew in yesterday.

981
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:18,150
No matter.

982
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:20,550
Kill away.

983
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:26,850
You're lying.

984
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:28,450
Am I?

985
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:49,550
Miss Finneran's escort
while she's here in Los Angeles.

986
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:51,250
Never leaves her for a moment.

987
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:54,150
I thought you'd be glad to know
she's in good hands.

988
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:01,750
Get some rest.
The boat will be ready for you on Friday.

989
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,450
If I see you or any
of your friends before then...

990
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:09,350
...Miss Finneran will be the victim of
a most gruesome violation before she dies.

991
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:11,950
As indeed will your father, Mr.Hockney...

992
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:15,350
...and your Uncle Randall in Arizona,
Mr.Kint.

993
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:19,750
I might only castrate
Mr.McManus' nephew, David.

994
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,650
Do I make myself clear?

995
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,550
We will take care
of the two bodies downstairs.

996
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,850
We'll add them to the cost of Mr.Fenster.

997
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,950
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

998
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:13,250
It's a logistical nightmare.

999
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:16,150
Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.

1000
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:19,750
There's no tellin'
how many more are gonna be below deck.

1001
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:22,050
Can we stealth these guys?

1002
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:25,650
With all that coke, they're gonna be ready.

1003
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:28,850
Which brings me to sunny point Number 2.

1004
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:33,050
Even if one of us gets through
and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.

1005
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:34,850
What if we wait for the money?

1006
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,150
Ten more men at least.

1007
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:40,750
In my opinion, it can't be done.

1008
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,350
Anyone who goes in
is not comin' out alive.

1009
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:46,450
- I'm gonna wait for the money.
- Me, too.

1010
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:49,950
- Did you hear what he just said?
- If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.

1011
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,250
Me, too.

1012
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:54,750
There's nothing that can't be done.

1013
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:01,550
I just can't believe
we're gonna walk in to certain death.

1014
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:10,350
The news said it's raining in New York.

1015
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,650
What language is that?

1016
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:37,050
I don't know. Russian, I think.

1017
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:40,250
Hungarian?

1018
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:46,950
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

1019
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:08,050
You kids ready?

1020
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:11,650
I would be if I didn't have to stop
and answer you.

1021
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:13,050
I'm ready.

1022
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:16,150
McManus, you better be set up
in 10 seconds.

1023
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:19,250
I'm ready.

1024
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:22,350
I want you to stay here.

1025
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,050
I'm supposed to cover--

1026
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:27,950
If we don't get out of this,
take the money and go.

1027
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,150
I can't--

1028
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:31,550
Find Edie.
Tell her everything that happened.

1029
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,650
She knows people. She knows what to do.

1030
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:36,750
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

1031
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:39,350
- What if I--
- Just do what I say.

1032
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:41,250
Please.

1033
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:46,150
Tell her that...

1034
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,350
Tell her I tried.

1035
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:07,050
McManus, he's on his way.

1036
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:08,750
I'm there.

1037
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:04,750
One, two, three, four...

1038
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:07,950
...five, six, seven...

1039
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,050
Oswald was a fag.

1040
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,550
Hi.

1041
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,750
How you doin'?

1042
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,950
Is there a problem?

1043
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:54,450
Now.

1044
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:27,950
"Old McDonald had a farm

1045
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:30,550
"Ee-aye, ee-aye, O

1046
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:35,450
"And on that farm, he shot some guys"

1047
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:10,650
Elvis has left the building.

1048
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:24,550
Hold fire. Hold fire. Vamonos!

1049
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,450
Hello.

1050
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:35,150
Why didn't you run?

1051
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:37,350
I froze up.

1052
01:22:38,150 --> 01:22:41,450
I thought about Fenster
and how he looked when we buried him.

1053
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:45,650
Then I thought about Keaton,
and it looked like he might pull it off.

1054
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:54,050
A boy found a body on the beach today.

1055
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:56,550
Thrown clear of the boat.
Shot twice in the head.

1056
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,550
Two guys from the Bureau identified him.

1057
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:00,750
- What else?
- His name was Arturo Marquez.

1058
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,750
A petty smuggler from Argentina.

1059
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:05,650
He was arrested last year in New York
for trafficking.

1060
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:09,550
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.

1061
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:12,950
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

1062
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:14,350
Now, get this.

1063
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:18,050
Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

1064
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:19,450
Kobayashi.

1065
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,650
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony.

1066
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:24,350
- He was a rat.
- A big fucking rat.

1067
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:27,150
Arturo was very opposed
to returning to prison.

1068
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:31,150
So much so,
that he named close to 50 people.

1069
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:33,650
Guess who he named in the finale.

1070
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:36,050
Keyser Soze.

1071
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:37,750
There's more.

1072
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:54,450
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1073
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:58,050
There was no dope on that boat.

1074
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:41,250
You, stay quiet.

1075
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:42,750
He's here.

1076
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:47,150
I know he's here. That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.

1077
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:48,950
I know he's here!

1078
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:53,650
- You can't understand. That's him.
- Shut up.

1079
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:58,150
That's him. You hear me?
I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!

1080
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:58,350
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know.

1081
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:00,050
There's no coke.

1082
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:02,150
- What?
- You heard me, dumb fuck.

1083
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,550
- There's no coke!
- What the fuck? No coke?

1084
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:07,250
I've been up and down
in every fucking room.

1085
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:09,550
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing!

1086
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:10,850
Nothing!

1087
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:12,850
Don't you fuck with me.

1088
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:16,850
There is no fucking coke!

1089
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:29,550
I'm out of here.

1090
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:12,250
I told them nothing.

1091
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,550
I swear.

1092
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:17,850
I told them nothing. Please.

1093
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:07,050
What the fuck is goin' on?

1094
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,550
The strangest thing.

1095
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,450
That's what you said.
You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.

1096
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:11,050
Wait a minute.

1097
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:13,150
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?

1098
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:16,750
- You said you didn't know who it was.
- I know there was dope on that boat.

1099
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:18,350
- Stop stallin'.
- I'm not.

1100
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:21,050
- You know what I'm getting at.
- Get out of my face.

1101
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:23,950
I got immunity. I don't have to take this.

1102
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:25,750
You know what I'm getting at.

1103
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,350
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The truth!

1104
01:30:28,450 --> 01:30:30,550
Try to tell me
you saw someone kill Keaton.

1105
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:31,650
I did.

1106
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:33,150
You're lying to me.

1107
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:36,650
- You've known this whole time.
- I don't know what you're saying.

1108
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:39,350
I did see Keaton get shot. I swear to you.

1109
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:42,050
Why didn't you help him? You had a gun.

1110
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:44,050
He was your friend.

1111
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:49,750
Because I was afraid.

1112
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:54,550
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

1113
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:57,850
- Afraid of--
- I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1114
01:30:58,150 --> 01:31:02,050
It was Keyser Soze, I mean,
the Devil himself.

1115
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:05,950
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1116
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:12,150
What if you miss?

1117
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:19,750
Let's get back to the pier.

1118
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:45,950
- Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?
- What? No.

1119
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,750
He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.

1120
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:51,150
He swore out a statement
to federal marshals...

1121
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:54,650
...saying that he had seen
and could positively identify one...

1122
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:55,950
...Keyser Soze.

1123
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:58,250
It says right here in the report.

1124
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:01,050
He had intimate knowledge
of his businesses, including...

1125
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:04,350
...but not exclusive to,
drug trafficking and murder.

1126
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:05,950
I never heard of him.

1127
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:08,850
His own people were selling him
to a gang of Hungarians.

1128
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:12,550
Most likely the same Hungarians
that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

1129
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:14,550
The money wasn't there for dope.

1130
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:16,950
The Hungarians were going
to buy the one guy...

1131
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,150
...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

1132
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:22,050
- I said I never heard of him.
- But Keaton did.

1133
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:25,150
Edie Finneran was Marquez's
extradition advisor.

1134
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,450
She knew who he was and what he knew.

1135
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:30,950
There were no drugs on that boat.
It was a hit.

1136
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:33,650
A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy...

1137
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,850
...that could finger Keyser Soze.

1138
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:38,050
So Soze put some thieves to it...

1139
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:40,850
...men he knew he could march
into certain death.

1140
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:43,650
You're saying Soze
sent us to kill someone?

1141
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:47,950
I'm saying Keaton did.
He left you behind for a reason.

1142
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:49,550
Just do what I tell you.

1143
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:52,850
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere...

1144
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:54,850
...why did he give you the money to run?

1145
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:58,250
- He could have used you on the boat.
- He wanted me to live.

1146
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:02,550
A one-time dirty cop without
a loyalty in the world...

1147
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:05,950
...finds it in his heart
to save a worthless rat cripple?

1148
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:07,450
No, sir. Why?

1149
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,250
Edie.

1150
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:11,950
I don't buy that reform story for a minute.

1151
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:13,350
Even if I did...

1152
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:17,050
...I certainly don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

1153
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:18,550
So why?

1154
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:22,850
Because he was my friend.

1155
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:26,850
No, he wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.

1156
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:28,350
What are you doing here?

1157
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:31,150
He saved you
because he wanted it that way.

1158
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,350
It was his will.

1159
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:35,650
- Keaton was Keyser Soze.
- No.

1160
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:39,250
A man who could wrangle the wills
of men like Hockney and McManus.

1161
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:41,850
A man who could engineer a police lineup...

1162
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:44,650
...through all his years of contacts in NYPD.

1163
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:47,250
The kind of man
who could've killed Edie Finneran.

1164
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:55,150
She was found yesterday
at a hotel in Pennsylvania...

1165
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,050
...shot twice in the head.

1166
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:04,850
What do you think about Keaton now?

1167
01:35:06,150 --> 01:35:07,150
Edie?

1168
01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:09,450
He used all of you to get him on that boat.

1169
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:12,850
He couldn't get on alone.
He had to pull the trigger himself...

1170
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:14,850
...to make sure he got his man...

1171
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:17,050
...the one man that could identify him.

1172
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:19,750
This is all bullshit.

1173
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:21,950
You said you saw him die.

1174
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:25,350
Or did you?

1175
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:27,950
You had to hide
when you heard the police cars.

1176
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:30,450
You said you heard the shot
before the fire...

1177
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,850
...but you didn't see him die.

1178
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:35,950
- I knew him. He would never--
- He programmed you.

1179
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:38,650
He programmed you to tell us
what he wanted you to.

1180
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,950
He knew we were close.
You said it yourself.

1181
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:44,050
Where was the political pressure
to protect you from?

1182
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:45,350
It was Keaton.

1183
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:48,750
- Immunity was your reward.
- But why me?

1184
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:51,450
Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?

1185
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:54,250
Why me? I'm stupid.
I'm a cripple. Why me?

1186
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,750
Because you're a cripple.

1187
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,950
Because you're stupid.

1188
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,150
Because you're weaker than them.

1189
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:05,750
If he's dead...

1190
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:10,150
If what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

1191
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:14,550
It was his idea to hit the taxi service,
wasn't it?

1192
01:36:14,650 --> 01:36:17,750
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.

1193
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:21,650
We followed him from the beginning.

1194
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:24,550
I didn't know.

1195
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:26,750
I saw him die.

1196
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:30,650
I believe he's dead. Christ.

1197
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:33,650
You're not safe on your own.

1198
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:38,950
You think he's...

1199
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:40,850
Keyser Soze?

1200
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:43,350
I don't know.

1201
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:48,750
Keyser Soze's a shield,
or like you said, a spook story.

1202
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:53,450
But I know Keaton, and someone
is out there pulling strings for you.

1203
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:57,650
- Stay here and let us protect you.
- I'm not bait. I post today.

1204
01:36:57,950 --> 01:36:59,350
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1205
01:36:59,950 --> 01:37:02,050
Capt. Leo wants you out of here.

1206
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:05,250
- Unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances.

1207
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:09,250
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1208
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:12,750
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1209
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:14,050
Maybe so.

1210
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:17,550
But I'm not a rat.

1211
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,850
Fuckin' cops.

1212
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:02,950
Excuse me, can I use your fax machine?

1213
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:09,550
You'll have to sign for these, Mr.Kint.

1214
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:13,350
One watch, gold.

1215
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:15,950
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1216
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:18,750
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1217
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:21,450
We still got nothing.

1218
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:24,050
I know what I wanted to know
about Keaton.

1219
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:25,750
Which is nothing.

1220
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:29,750
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.

1221
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:32,850
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...

1222
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:36,150
...if Keaton is alive,
he's not comin' up again.

1223
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:38,450
I'll find him.

1224
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:40,350
Waste of time.

1225
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:45,550
A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.

1226
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:47,150
What?

1227
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,250
Nothing.

1228
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:53,050
Man, you're a slob.

1229
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:55,450
But it all has a system.

1230
01:38:56,350 --> 01:39:00,750
It all makes sense if you look at it right.
You gotta stand back from it.

1231
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:05,150
You wanna see a real horror show?
See my garage.

1232
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:44,550
Convince me. Tell me every last...

1233
01:39:44,650 --> 01:39:47,650
When I was in that barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois...

1234
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:51,250
- Where's your head?
- We need to think, think back.

1235
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:52,950
I'm sure you've heard tall tales.

1236
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:54,650
- Bricks Marlin.
- This isn't right.

1237
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:57,150
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

1238
01:39:57,250 --> 01:40:00,650
- I'm tellin' it straight.
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.

1239
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:03,250
- A gift from Mr.Soze.
- Talk to me.

1240
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:06,350
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

1241
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:09,450
- Using pawns...
- A big fat guy. Like, orca fat.

1242
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:11,250
There was a lawyer...

1243
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:12,950
Kobayashi...

1244
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:16,550
When I was picking beans
in Guatemala we made fresh coffee.

1245
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:19,650
- I know you thought he was a good man.
- I know he was good.

1246
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:24,950
- You tell me every last detail.
- The strangest thing.

1247
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:26,950
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1248
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:30,250
This guy is protected from up
on high by the Prince of...

1249
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:32,650
What's your story, pretzel man?

1250
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:34,550
- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer?

1251
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:35,750
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

1252
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:39,350
- Kobayashi. Kobayashi.
- Tell me every last detail.

1253
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:42,650
- I work for Keyser Soze.
- Convince me. Convince me.

1254
01:40:57,950 --> 01:41:00,550
Every creep and scumbag
that works the street...

1255
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:02,750
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.

1256
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:04,850
The cripple, did you see him?

1257
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:08,050
- The cripple! Which way did he go?
- He went out that way.

1258
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:10,750
I know you know something.
I know you're not telling...

1259
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:11,950
I'm smarter than you...

1260
01:41:12,050 --> 01:41:14,550
...and I'm gonna find out
whether you like it or not.

1261
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:16,550
To a cop, the explanation
is never complicated.

1262
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:18,150
- It's always simple.
- The truth!

1263
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:21,150
There's no arch-criminal behind it all.

1264
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,050
Somebody with power,
somebody who is capable...

1265
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,850
Keyser Soze!

1266
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:29,950
You think a guy like that
gets this close to getting caught...

1267
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:32,050
...and sticks his head out?

1268
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:35,950
Because you're stupid.
Because you're a cripple.

1269
01:41:36,050 --> 01:41:38,150
What I wanna know is, who's the gimp?

1270
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:40,650
You've known the whole fuckin' time.

1271
01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:44,350
If he comes up for anything
it'll be for me. I'm sure Keaton is dead.

1272
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:47,350
I can't feel my legs, Keyser.

1273
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:49,950
First thing I learned on the job.
You know what?

1274
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:53,550
- How to spot a murderer.
- You got the cripple in there?

1275
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:56,350
- Did he mention Keyser Soze?
- Who?

1276
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:58,150
After that...

1277
01:41:58,650 --> 01:42:01,650
...my guess is you'll never hear
from him again.

1278
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:24,450
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...

1279
01:42:24,650 --> 01:42:27,350
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

1280
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:30,450
And like that...

1281
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:33,550
...he's gone.

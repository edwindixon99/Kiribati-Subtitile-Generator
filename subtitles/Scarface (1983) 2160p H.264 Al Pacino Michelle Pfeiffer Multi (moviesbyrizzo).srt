in the United States.

word for "pig."

528
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,289
A guy who wants
more than he needs.

529
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,044
He don't fly
straight no more.

530
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,691
So, it comes down
to one thing,

531
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,491
Tony boy,
and you never forget it.

532
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:41,642
Lesson Number 1:

533
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,965
Don't underestimate

534
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,407
the other guy's greed!

535
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,126
ELVIRA: Lesson Number 2:

536
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,248
Don't get high on
your own supply.

537
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,725
That's right.
Lesson Number 2:

538
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,643
Don't get high on
your own supply.

539
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,291
Course, not everybody
follows the rules.

540
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,689
Your champagne,
Mr. Lopez.

541
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,125
That is '64?

542
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,531
The best, Mr. Lopez.

543
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,250
Omar, you pour it,
and you bring

544
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,084
another bottle
right away, will you?

545
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,685
Pleasure, Mr. Lopez.

546
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,404
$550 for this bottle, Tony.
What do you think of that?

547
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,601
That's pretty good.

548
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,126
For a bunch of
fucking grapes.

549
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,845
So, here's to old friends
and to new friends.

550
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,530
How you like it, Tony?

551
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,323
That's good, Frank.
That's good?

552
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,640
Like you say, man.

553
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:47,926
That's good!

554
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,925
I'm gonna get you
new clothes, too.

555
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,964
I'm gonna get you
$550 suits,

556
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,483
so you look real sharp.

557
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,641
'Cause I want
you to work for me.

558
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:08,169
I want you and your boys
to work with Omar here.

559
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,240
We are going to do
something big next month.

560
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,082
We are running a string
of mules from Colombia.

561
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,081
You do good on that, there'll
be some other things.

562
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,486
That sounds like
fun to me, Frank.

563
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,245
You want a cigar?

564
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,645
You wanna dance, Frank,

565
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:38,451
or sit here and
have a heart attack?

566
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:47,603
Who? Me, dance? I want a
heart attack instead.

567
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,922
Don't foam into
the Dommie P.

568
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,446
How about you?

569
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,843
What? You want me
to dance?

570
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,968
Yeah, sure. Go on, Tony.
You dance.

571
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,250
Go on.
Have some fun.

572
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,923
What do you
think of him?

573
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,288
I think he's
a fucking peasant!

574
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:35,286
But you get a guy
like that on your side,

575
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,121
he breaks his back
for you.

576
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,247
What's your name?

577
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,367
What?

578
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,166
What's your name?
Elvira what?

579
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,446
Hancock.

580
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,681
What?

581
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,041
Hancock!

582
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,326
Hancock?

583
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,004
Sounds like a bird.
Hancock.

584
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,845
Flying around.

585
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,240
Where you from?

586
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,127
Baltimore.

587
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,241
What?

588
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,243
Baltimore!
Baltimore?

589
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,721
Where's that?

590
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,531
It doesn't
really matter, okay?

591
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:41,251
I'm just trying
to be friendly.

592
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,567
I don't need
another friend,

593
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,047
especially one who just
got off a banana boat.

594
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,369
Banana boat?

595
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,249
Hold it.
You got the wrong guy.

596
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,209
I don't come off
no banana boat.

597
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,247
You're thinking
of someone else, maybe.

598
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,802
Aren't you part
of the Cuban crime wave?

599
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,204
What you talking crazy for?
I'm a political refugee here.

600
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,970
So take it easy.
Don't talk crazy.

601
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,405
Sorry.

602
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,929
I didn't know you were so sensitive
about your diplomatic status.

603
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,771
What is your problem, baby?

604
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,160
You're good-looking.

605
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,322
You got a beautiful body,
beautiful legs,

606
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,846
a beautiful face, all these
guys in love with you.

607
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,490
Only you got
a look in your eye

608
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,245
like you haven't been
fucked in a year!

609
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,809
Hey, José.

610
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,208
Who, why, when and how I fuck
is none of your business, okay?

611
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,725
Now you're
talking to me, baby.

612
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:33,524
That I like.
Keep it coming.

613
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,763
Don't call me "baby"!
I'm not your baby.

614
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,011
Not yet, but you gotta
give me some time.

615
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,643
Even if I were blind,
desperate,

616
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,047
starved and begging for it
on a desert island,

617
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,521
you'd be the last thing
I'd ever fuck.

618
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,809
That chick he's with...

619
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,084
MANNY: Yeah?
...she likes me.

620
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,208
She likes you?
How do you know?

621
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,686
I know.

622
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:09,283
The eyes, chico.
They never lie.

623
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,882
Are you serious?

624
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,644
Serious?
What do you think?

625
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,247
That's the boss's
lady,okay?

626
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,446
You're gonna
get us killed.

627
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:23,649
Fuck you, man.
The boss's lady.

628
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,370
That guy's soft.

629
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,965
Look in his face.

630
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,645
The booze and the concha
tell him what to do.

631
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,641
Don't fucking go
crazy on me, okay?

632
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:43,124
Just remember last year
at this time

633
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,407
we were in
a fucking cage, okay?

634
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,845
You remember.

635
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,644
I'd like
to forget that.

636
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,528
I say be happy
with what you got.

637
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,011
You be happy-

638
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,285
Me, I want
what's coming to me.

639
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,885
What's coming to you?

640
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,488
<i>The worm, chico,</i>

641
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,889
and everything in it.

642
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,521
Oh, man.

643
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,642
THREE MONTHS LATER

644
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,050
This is paradise.

645
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,847
This is paradise,
I'm telling you.

646
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:52,563
This town's like a great big pussy
just waiting to get fucked.

647
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:56,520
I should've come
here 10 years ago.

648
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,410
I'd have been a
millionaire by this time.

649
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,404
By this time, I'd
have had my own boat,

650
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,887
my own car,
my own golf course.

651
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,924
You know what I want? I thought
of this the other day.

652
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,650
A line of blue jeans.

653
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,963
With my name written on the
back of chicks' asses.

654
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,721
How's that?

655
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,880
That sounds
completely crazy to me.

656
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,965
Look at that. Look.

657
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,731
You're missing the sights.
That's what you're doing.

658
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,086
We're missing
the action.

659
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,003
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

660
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,726
Want to have some ice cream
with my friend and me?

661
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,609
Get lost, greaseball!

662
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,489
Look at that.
Ice cream?

663
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,329
That's right.
You said "ice cream"?

664
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:40,441
Girls like ice cream.

665
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,602
Oh, come on.
That won't work.

666
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,643
You can't
do it that way.

667
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,650
You know how you pick up
chicks in this country?

668
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,682
What was that?
What you just did?

669
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,000
That's what you do.

670
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:56,881
That's disgusting.

671
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:57,927
Watch.

672
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,844
Look at that fucking thing.
You look like a lizard.

673
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,167
Like a bug coming
out of your mouth.

674
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,248
Figures you
wouldn't understand.

675
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,481
But the women
in this country,

676
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,568
when you do that,
they know.

677
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,641
They know what?

678
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,643
They understand.
They go crazy.

679
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,041
It'll take practice,
but you gotta learn.

680
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,282
'Cause women love
when you suck the pussy.

681
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,646
Look at that.

682
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,246
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

683
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,924
She's looking at us.

684
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,041
You think you
can do it with her?

685
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,326
I think I can.

686
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,965
TONY: You want to
try it with her?

687
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,166
MAN NY: Why not?

688
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,924
You gonna watch me?

689
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,684
I'm looking at you.
Go ahead.

690
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,444
You won't do it.
Watch this.

691
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:45,325
I'm with you, man.

692
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,485
I'm gonna get her.

693
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,807
Go ahead, Romeo!
Do your thing.

694
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,281
Just be quiet.
Just hang back.

695
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,691
Romeo!

696
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,647
You're looking
very pretty today.

697
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,245
Yes, you.
I've been watching you.

698
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:07,483
You want to see
something funny?

699
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,688
Take a look over there.
See that man?

700
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:12,241
Watch that guy.
I gotta sit down here.

701
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,601
I gotta watch my friend.

702
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,365
He gonna stick his
tongue out to that girl.

703
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,851
Oh, look at that.

704
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,006
You're sick!

705
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,321
You see what
happened to him?

706
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,648
If I wasn't
a nice guy...

707
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,364
She's too big for you.

708
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,364
Causing trouble
like that, come on.

709
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,926
Bitch! Lesbian!
What I try to tell you?

710
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,405
What I try to tell you?

711
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,404
This country, you gotta
make the money first.

712
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,644
Then when you get the
money, you get the power.

713
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,929
Then when you get the power,
then you get the women.

714
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,808
That's why you gotta
make your own moves.

715
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,609
MANNY: That's the one
I rented.

716
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:51,887
No. That's her, man.
There she is.

717
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:53,566
About time.

718
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,047
Frank got held up
at the golf course.

719
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,690
He told me
to pick you up.

720
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,931
He said he'd meet us
at the track later.

721
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,242
He said to bet on Ice Cream
in the first, by the way.

722
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,084
In that thing?
You must be kidding.

723
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,923
What you talking about?
That's a Cadillac.

724
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,642
I wouldn't be
caught dead in that.

725
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,767
Oh, come on.

726
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:28,282
It's got a few years,
but it's a cream puff.

727
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,447
It looks like
somebody's nightmare.

728
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,287
So, you like
this better?

729
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,166
Yeah.

730
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,491
It's like one of them
tigers from India.

731
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,728
Tigers, huh?
Tigers, no?

732
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,768
Crazy guy. Know what
he's been doing?

733
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,684
Dragging me to the zoo
to look at tigers.

734
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,524
He says he's
gonna buy one.

735
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,120
You do that and you won't
have any friends left.

736
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,605
Not that you have
any now.

737
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,444
You're gonna like
that tiger, man.

738
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,444
You gonna drive around with a
tiger in your passenger seat?

739
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,966
Maybe.
Some lady tiger.

740
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,566
How much?

741
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,165
43,000, fully equipped.

742
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,884
That all?

743
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,689
Machine-gun
turrets are extra.

744
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:21,804
He's a funny guy.
Come here, Manny.

745
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,161
Bulletproof this, okay?

746
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,328
And this here and here.

747
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,845
MANNY: Okay.
TONY: And the windows.

748
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,648
Get me a phone
with a scrambler.

749
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,960
A scrambler.

750
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,520
And a radio
with scanners

751
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,608
to pick up flying saucers,
stuff like that.

752
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:44,330
Don't forget
the fog lights.

753
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,371
Oh. In case I get caught in a swamp.
That's a good idea.

754
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,564
(HORN HONKING)

755
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:54,484
Get out of the way, lady!
I'm trying to drive here!

756
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:58,241
I thought you were
taking me to Frank.

757
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,366
We got an hour.
You hungry?

758
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,889
No, but I'm bored.

759
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,524
Well, that figures.

760
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:18,042
Check it out, Manny, okay?
And pay the guy.

761
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,563
And you take a taxi. Meet
me at the track, okay?

762
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,370
Good doing business with you.
Mr. Montana.

763
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,245
Oh, God, man!

764
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,207
I wouldn't buy the car
if you didn't like it.

765
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:34,091
Planning on driving the girls
crazy, aren't you, Tony?

766
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,447
Oh, yeah.
You know who?

767
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,369
What would Frank say?

768
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,404
I like Frank,
you know?

769
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,769
Only I like you better.

770

771
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,806
You got some for me?

772
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,961
Sure.

773
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,766
Okay.

00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,446
Okay.

00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,851
Don't get confused, Tony.

777
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,048
I don't fuck around
with the help.

778
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,446
You wanna play that way
with me, I play with you.

779
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:32,800
Shit.

780
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,129
Would you kiss me
if I wear the hat?

781
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,287
No!

782
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,971
Playtime is over, okay?

783
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,280

784
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,646
Okay.

785

786

Long time.

788
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,489
No postcards
from jail, huh?

789
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,481
Gina.

790
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,645
Tony?

791
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,085
Look at you.

792
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,570
You're beautiful.

793
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,247
I didn't...

794
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,004
Mama, look at
those eyes, huh.

795
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,850
Look at that.
She looks like me.

796
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,126
(LAUGHS)

797
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,044
You know the last time I saw
you, you was like that.

798
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,687
You looked like a little boy.
Now look at you.

799
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,889
I got something
for you.

800
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,923
It's no big deal.

801
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,921
Oh, Tony!

(SOBBING)

803
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,801
I never thought I'd see
you again, you know?

804
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,002
You think they'd keep
a guy like me down?

805
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,650
Well, no.

806
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,604
You look so good.

807
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,889
Look, open that up.
Open it.

808
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,686
For me?

809
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,807
I think so.

810
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:12,448
It's nothing much,
you know, nothing.

(EXCLAIMING)

812
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,925
See what's
written on the back?

813
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,287
GINA: On the back? Aw.

814
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,207
Always.

815
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,124
"Always."
It's beautiful, Tony!

816
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,842
Mama is still working
in the factory,

817
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,042
and I work part-time
in a beauty parlor.

818
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,249
I'm doing hair, Tony. Do you
remember Hiram Gonzalez?

819
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,211
His father owned that barbershop.
It's his place.

820
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,965
Plus I go to junior college.
Miami Dade.

821
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,124
In two more years, I get
my cosmetology license.

822
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,169
Then I'll be
making enough money...

823
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,526
Surprise!

824
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,845
All that's over,
starting today.

825
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,321
Why?

826
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:54,283
My kid sister
don't have to work

827
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,125
in no beauty parlor,
and Mama,

828
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,160
she don't have to
sew in no factory.

829
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:02,522
Your son made it, Mama.

830
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,331
He's a success.

831
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,881
That's why I didn't
come around before.

832
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:13,731
I want you to see what
a good boy I've been.

00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,845
And take this lousy money
with you. It stinks.

880
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,286
Tony.

881
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:46,450
Why do you have to spoil
it for everybody, huh?

882
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,764
I'm sorry, Tony.

883
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,845
Okay, Mama.

884
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,685
No. Tony,
wait a minute!

885
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:00,807
Don't go, please!

886
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:01,927
Gina, stay here!

887
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,207
No, Mama.

888
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,281
He's no good. Gina!

889
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,443
Tony, wait, please!

890
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,128
I'm sorry.
I don't know.

891
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,521
Mama, ever since
Papa left, she's...

892
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:14,762
Forget Papa.
We never had one.

893
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:17,531
I know you did some
bad things back then.

894
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,445
In the Army, I know you
got into some trouble.

895
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,284
The Communists,

896
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,442
they're always trying
to tell you what to do.

897
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,124
Mama doesn't
understand that.

898
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,361
I know.

899
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,611
I just...
I don't know.

900
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:34,286
I just want you to know
that I don't care.

901
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,851
It doesn't matter
to me how long

902
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:38,446
you've been away,
five or ten years.

903
00:57:40,560 --> 00:57:43,723
You're my blood, always.

904
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,526
I know.

905
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,562
Come on.
I want you to take this.

906
00:57:58,640 --> 00:57:59,721
I gotta go back in.

907
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,166
No, Tony. Please.

908
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,571
You need this.

909
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,011
What will I tell her?

910
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,809
Take that. You don't
tell her anything.

911
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,245
Don't tell her
I gave it to you,

912
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:09,448
but give her some
from time to time.

913
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:12,166
And listen,
you go out yourself.

914
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:15,722
Go ahead. Go out, do some things.
Have some fun.

915
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:18,008
You gotta get
some fun out of life.

916
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,924
You gonna beat yourself
to death at 19?

917
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,566
A pussycat like you?
Come here.

918
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,809
I'll talk to you again. Okay.

919
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,002
Put that money away.
Don't let her see it.

920
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,605
I'll talk to her.

921
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:36,925
I'll talk to you.
Okay.

922
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:40,161
Let's go.

923
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:43,446
She's beautiful.
How come you...

924
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,760
Hey!

925
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,285
Stay away from her.
You hear?

926
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:53,610
She's not for you.

927
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:54,806
Okay.

928
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,680
(ENGINE STARTING)

929
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:08,124
COCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA

930
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:22,049
So, this and my
other factory,

931
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,321
I can guarantee production

932
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,485
of 200 kilos refined
every month of the year.

933
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,201
The problem is,
I have no steady market.

934
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,682
Basically, what I'm looking
for is somebody in the States

935
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,967
who can share
the risk with me,

936
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,166
somebody
who can guarantee

937
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,450
to buy from me, say,
150 kilos a month.

938
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:46,164
Oh, that's a big commitment, Mr.
Sosa. Something like that...

939
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,607
Too bad Frank's not here.
You should talk to him.

940
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:51,603
It would've been
nice if he'd come.

941
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,761
He would like to come,

942
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,002
but with his trial
coming up,

943
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,447
it's hard to
leave the country.

944
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,363
So he sent
you instead?

945
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,930
Something like that.

946
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,287
We'll talk at my house,
shall we?

947
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:07,327
You got good stuff here.
Class-A shit.

948
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:32,926
This Lopez guarantees
to buy 150 kilos from me

949
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,286
every month
of the year.

950
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,606
He picks it up here.

951
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,921
I can sell it to him
for as little as

952
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,322
7,000 a key. You can't
do better than that.

953
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,970
But then we got to take
the risk of moving it.

954
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:50,170
We'll be cutting out the Colombians.
Know what that means?

955
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,163
That means we have to
go to war with them.

956
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:55,801
We cut out the Colombians,
we take risks on both sides.

957
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,763
TONY: Why don't
we split the risk?

958
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,001
You guarantee your delivery,
say, as far as Panama,

959
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:05,569
we take it from there.

960
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,322
Panama is risky.
It costs me more.

961
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,244
Panama I can sell
for 13.5 a key.

962
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:21,046
13.5?
What, are you nuts?

963
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:26,281
13.5? We still got to take
that shit to Florida.

964
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,488
Do you know what
that's like these days?

965
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,642
You got the Navy everywhere.

966
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,802
You got frogmen.

967
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,167
You got EC2s with
the satellite-tracking shit.

968
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,048
You got the fucking Bell 209
assault choppers up the ass.

969
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,046
We're losing one
out of every nine loads.

970
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,924
That's no duckwalk anymore,
let me tell you.

971
01:01:46,120 --> 01:01:47,565
Forget about 13.5.

972
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,730
(PHONE RINGING)

973
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,885
What do you suggest
that is reasonable?

974
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:01,528
Excuse me.
One moment.

975
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,327
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

976
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,084
Are you negotiating
for Frank Lopez?

977
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,401
Don't worry about it.
Take it easy.

978
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,529
I'm not worried about it.
You should worry about it.

979
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,964
If he wants to make a deal,
it's up to him, not you.

980
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,610
We're doing this
one deal. That's it.

981
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,603
Fuck you.
How's that?

982
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:25,484
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

983
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:28,365
OMAR: You need to open your
eyes and keep your mouth shut.

984
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,930
That's it.
Let it go at that.

985
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:31,365
TONY: Don't worry
about it.

986
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,408
Your head's in
the wrong place.

987
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,760
You must watch
out for yourself.

988
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,046
Why not talk to him?

989
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,088
You think he wants
to give you the money?

990
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,650
Shut the fuck up.

991
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,802
I'm doing
the talking here, not you.

992
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:45,291
You're here to watch my back.
Watch my back.

993
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,722
Better than your front,
let me tell you.

994
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,290
That's easier to watch.
(INAUDIBLE)

995
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,771
Close your mouth.

996
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:55,403
I can't wait to see what Frank's
gonna react to this one.

997
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,571
Just shut up. I'm doing
the talking here.

998
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,040
SOSA: Now where were we?

999
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,281
Panama.

1000
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,007
You're looking for
a partner, right?

1001
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:07,930
Something like that.

1002
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,482
Look, Mr. Sosa, we're
getting ahead of ourselves.

1003
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:16,722
I am down on Frank's authority
to buy 200 keys, that's it.

1004
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,928
That's my limit.
I got no right.

1005
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,161
Nobody got no right
to negotiate...

1006
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:22,083
Let the man
finish, okay?

1007
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,891
Let him propose a proposition,
then we can talk more.

1008
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,962
You got no
authority here.

1009
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,850
I started you in this business,
so shut the fuck up.

1010
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,366
Frank is gonna love it.

1011
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:33,930
That's up to Frank,
not you!

1012
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:39,568
I'm sorry about this,
Mr. Sosa.

1013
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,565
No, it is all right.

1014
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:45,363
You're right. Maybe you
should talk to Frank.

1015
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,366
Well, good.

1016
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:53,849
I don't think it's something I
want to do on an overseas phone.

1017
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:57,124
But as soon as
I get back to Miami,

1018
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,043
I will talk to
Frank personally.

1019
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,207
Good.

1020
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,406
My associates can escort
you to my chopper

1021
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,164
to take you
to Santa Cruz.

1022
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:09,369
I have a jet there. You'll
be in Miami in five hours.

1023
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,444
You'll be back here
tomorrow in time for lunch.

1024
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,445
Good.

1025

01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:20,570
Good talking to you.

1027
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,728
Why not leave
your friend here?

1028
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,610
While you're gone, he can tell
me how to run my business.

1029
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:28,364
I think Frank
wants to see him.

1030
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:29,805
No, that's okay.

1031
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,521
You tell Frank I'm keeping
this guy on ice for him.

Let's finish
our lunch.

1035
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,642
I have to hand it
to you, Mr. Sosa.

1036
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,321
You got everything
a man could want.

1037
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,011
I like you, Tony. There
is no lying in you.

1038
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:01,404
Unfortunately,
I don't feel the same

1039
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,767

your organization.

What do you mean
by that, Mr. Sosa?

1042
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,647
I'm talking
about Omar Suarez.

1043
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:18,887
This garbage was recognized
by my associate at lunch

1044
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,207
from several years ago
in New York.

1045
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,682
He was an informer
for the police.

So how do I know you're
not a chivato, too, Tony?

1050
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:02,681
Hey,Sosa.

1051
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,561
Let's get this
straight now.

1052
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:13,410
I've never fucked anybody over
who didn't have it coming.

1053
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:15,045
You got that?

1054
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,766
All I have in this world
is my balls and my word.

1055
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:23,282
I don't break them for
no one, you understand?

1056
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,051
That piece of shit up
there, I never liked him,

1057
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,610
I never trusted him.

1058
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,848
For all I know,
he had me set up

1059
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,287
and had my friend
Angel Fernandez killed.

1060
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:35,801
But that's history.
I'm here, he's not.

1061
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,241
You want to go on
with me, say it.

1062
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:41,091
You don't,
then you make a move.

1063
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:49,445
I think you speak
from the heart, Montana.

1064
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,931
But I say to myself,

1065
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,002
"This Lopez, your boss,

1066
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:57,924
"he had chivatos like
that working for him."

1067
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:00,490
His judgment stinks.

1068
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:04,962
So I think to myself,

1069
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,444
"How many other mistakes
has this Lopez guy made?

1070
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:14,805
"How can I trust his
organization?" You tell me, Tony.

1071
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,010
Frank is smart,
you know?

1072
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,727
You can't blame him
for that animal.

1073
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:28,725
It's a crazy business
we're in, you know?

1074
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:31,565
That could happen
to anyone, even you.

1075
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,890
Why don't I go back
and talk to Frank

1076
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,365
and work it out?

1077
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:46,208
I'll fix things
between us.

1078
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,730
You got my word on that.

1079
01:07:51,360 --> 01:07:54,250
I think you and me, we
can work this thing out,

1080
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:57,326
we do business together
a long time.

1081
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:00,685
Just remember,

1082
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,842
I'll only tell you
one time,

1083
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,008
don't fuck me, Tony.

1084
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,642
Don't you ever
try to fuck me.

1085
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,766
FRAN K: You what?

1086
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,482
You made a deal
for fucking $18 million

1087
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,925
without even
checking with me?

1088
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,082
Are you crazy, Montana?
Are you crazy?

1089
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:37,969
Coño. Take it easy.
<i>Coño,</i> my ass!

1090
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:41,169
At 10.5 a key,
it's puro.

1091
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,041
You can't lose money.
No way.

1092
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,567
We make 75 million
on this deal.

1093
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,607
75 million.

1094
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,643
That is serious money.

1095
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:58,763
What is Sosa
going to do

1096
01:08:58,840 --> 01:09:01,127
when I don't come up
with the first 5 million?

1097
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:04,005
What is he going to do?
Will he send me a bill?

1098
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,447
He'll send
a hit squad up here!

1099
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:07,567
There'll be
a war in the street.

1100
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:11,406
Relax! Take it easy.
I'm in tight with Sosa.

1101
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,369
You short a couple of mil,
I go on the street for you.

1102
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:18,409
I make a couple
of moves,

1103
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,487
a mil here, a mil there,
you got it.

1104
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,401
Okay?

1105
01:09:27,240 --> 01:09:29,607
You've been making moves
on your own?

1106
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,804
I got ears, you know.
I hear things.

1107
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:41,530
What do you hear about Echevierra
and the Diaz brothers?

1108
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,807
What about Gomez?

1109
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,241
What'll he do when you
start moving 2,000 keys...

1110
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:50,245
Fuck Gaspar Gomez and
fuck the Diaz brothers!

1111
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,560
Fuck them all!

1112
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:54,641
I'll bury
those cockroaches!

1113
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:58,004
What they ever do for us?

1114
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,804
Look, Frank,
the time has come.

1115
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,964
We gotta expand.

1116
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,644
The whole operation.
Distribution.

1117
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,964
New York, Chicago, LA.

1118
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,525
We gotta set our own mark
and enforce it.

1119
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:27,090
We gotta think big now.

1120
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:32,966
Think big.

1121
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,684
Like your friend Sosa.

1122
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,488
Let me tell you something about
that greaseball cocksucker.

1123
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,651
He is a snake,
that's what he is.

1124
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:55,365
You turn your back on
him, he'll stick it in.

1125
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:58,328
You don't trust
a guy like that.

1126
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,047
You want me
to believe

1127
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,845
Omar was a stoolie
because Sosa said so?

1128
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:08,885
You bought that line?

1129
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,010
Maybe I made a mistake
sending you down there.

1130
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:17,683
Maybe you and Sosa know
something I don't know.

1131
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,041
Like what?

1132
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,611
Like what?

1133
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,368
You tell me,
"Like what."

1134
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:35,126
You calling me
a liar, Frank?

1135
01:11:36,200 --> 01:11:37,929
That what you're
calling me?

1136
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,570
Let's just say
I want things

1137
01:11:45,640 --> 01:11:47,722
to stay the way
they are for now.

1138
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,611
You stall your deal
with Sosa.

1139
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,606
Stall it?

1140
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,570
Okay, boss.

1141
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:04,241
Come on.

1142
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:07,960
I am the boss.

1143
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,481
Sure, you're the boss.

1144
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,766
Hey, Tony.

1145
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,771
Remember I told you
when you started,

1146
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,446
the guys who last
in this business

1147
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,481
are the guys
who fly straight,

1148
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,285
low-key, quiet.

1149
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,602
And the guys
who want it all,

1150
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:34,608
<i>chicas,</i> champagne, flash,

1151
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,045
they don't last.

1152
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,806
You finished?

1153
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,966
Can I go now?

1154
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:06,964
Hi, there.

1155
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,970
You just missed Frank.

1156
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:20,241
Too bad.

1157
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,688
Only I didn't
come to see Frank.

1158
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:29,164
This is not the time
or the place, Tony.

1159
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:31,130
Next time,
make an appointment.

1160
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:32,247
That's okay.

1161
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:35,483
I got something important I
want to talk to you about.

1162
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,966
So why don't we have
a couple of drinks,

1163
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,851
act normal,

1164
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,924
and just take it easy?

1165
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,683
Come on.
I like Scotch.

1166
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,925
Sure. Why not?

1167
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,843
Okay.
I won't bite you.

1168
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,482
We're all normal here.

1169
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,961
I heard you and Frank aren't
working together anymore.

1170
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,685
That's right.

1171
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,527
I think it's easier,
don't you?

1172
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:24,969
Makes things easier.

1173
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:28,646
Thank you.

1174
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,088
Here's to
the land of opportunity.

1175
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:34,610
For you, maybe.

1176
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,886
You like kids?

1177
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,807
Kids?

1178
01:14:44,440 --> 01:14:46,681
Kids. You know, kids.
Little kids.

1179
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:50,568
Sure. Why not?

1180
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:52,450
As long as
there's a nurse.

1181
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:55,490
Good, 'cause
I like kids, too.

1182
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:01,604
I like them. Boys, girls.
Don't matter to me.

1183
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,008
Frank's gonna be
back any minute.

1184
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:09,005
Come here.

1185
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:17,087
Sit here.

1186
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,405
I want to talk to you.
Sit down.

1187
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:21,289
I'm not gonna bite you.

1188
01:15:27,240 --> 01:15:29,049
Okay, here's the story.

1189
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,483
I come from the gutter.
I know that.

1190
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,965
I got no education,
but that's okay.

1191
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,408
I know the street,

1192
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,006
and I'm making
all the right connections.

1193
01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,681
With the right woman,
there's no stopping me.

1194
01:15:53,480 --> 01:15:55,562
I could go
right to the top.

1195
01:15:57,680 --> 01:16:01,810
Anyway, what I got
to tell you is this,

1196
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,530
I like you.

1197
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,610
I liked you the first time
I laid eyes on you.

1198
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,525
I said, "She's a tiger.

1199
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:21,808
"She'll belong to me."

1200
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,211
Anyway,

1201
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,284
I want you
to marry me.

1202
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,324
I want you to be the
mother of my children.

1203
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:42,203
Me? Marry you?

1204
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,520
That's right.

1205
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:48,171
(SIGHS)

1206
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,004
What about Frank, Tony?

1207
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:52,284
What will you do
about Frank?

1208
01:16:52,360 --> 01:16:55,921
Frank is not gonna last, okay?
He's finished.

1209
01:16:58,240 --> 01:17:00,846
Just think
about it, okay?

1210
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,487
I want you to
really think about it.

1211
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:10,124
I'll go now.
Take care.

1212
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:18,887
(MUSIC PLAYING)

1213
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,564
All your enemies
are gone.

1214
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,326
Mr. Montana.
How are you?

1215
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:24,640
Hello.

1216
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:34,323
What the fuck
she doing here?

1217
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:36,966
MANNY: Come on, man.
She's just dancing.

1218
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,769
Come on.
Take it easy.

1219
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:54,161
It's just a disco.

1220
01:17:54,240 --> 01:17:55,480
Who's that guy
she's with?

1221
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,047
MANNY: He's some guy who works for Luco.
He's nobody.

1222
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,849
He's harmless.
Works for Luco?

1223
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,400
Yeah. Forget him.

1225
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:09,245
Hello, Tony.
You remember me?

1226
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:15,531
Bernstein.
Mel Bernstein, right?

1227
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,528
Chief Detective,
Narcotics.

1228
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:22,125
That's right, yeah.
I think we should talk.

1229
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,406
Talk? What are we
going to talk about?

1230
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:28,964
I ain't killed nobody,
not lately.

1231
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:31,124
No, not lately.

1232
01:18:31,240 --> 01:18:34,961
What about ancient history,
like Emilio Rebenga?

1233
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:38,243
Or a bunch of whacked-out
Indians at the Sun Ray Motel?

1234
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:41,962
Whoever's giving you
your information

1235
01:18:42,040 --> 01:18:43,769
is taking you
for a long ride.

1236
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:45,241
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

1237
01:18:45,320 --> 01:18:47,721

we gonna talk,

1238
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:50,724

your wiseass spic balls

1239

1240
01:18:58,080 --> 01:18:59,650
Keep your eye on her.

1241
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,244
MANNY: I'll do that.
TONY: Okay.

1242
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,002

Good.

1243
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,321
The word on the street is you're
bringing in a lot of <i>yeyo.</i>

1244
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:20,086
That means you're not a
small-time punk anymore,

1245
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,083

property now.

1246
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:25,004
Supreme Court says that your
privacy can be invaded.

1247
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:26,844
Okay. How much?

1248
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:29,771

1249
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:32,926
There's an answer
to that, too.

1250
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,885
Here's how much.

1251
01:19:42,160 --> 01:19:43,446
Can you see it?

1252
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,369
Big number.
Yeah!

1253
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,444
That's on a monthly basis,
same thing every month.

1254
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:52,644
You know
how this works?

1255
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:55,971
No. You tell me.

1256
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,961
We tell you who's
moving against you,

1257
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,130
and we shake down
who you want shaken down.

1258
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,368
Let's say that you got a real
problem making a collection.

1259
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,643
And then we step in
for you.

1260
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,407
Got eight killers with
badges working for me.

1261
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:13,766
When they hit, it hurts.

1262
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:15,569
Same thing
works the other way.

1263
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:17,722
You feed me
a bust now and then.

1264
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,368

himself up in business.

Metro? DEA?

1269

gonna crawl out from under?

1270
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,444
Well, that's not
my business, Tony.

1271
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,760
We don't cross no lines.

1272
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:50,845
You think I want
this conversation

1273
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:52,763
going any farther
than this table?

1274
01:20:53,240 --> 01:20:56,449
My guys' got families.
They're legitimate cops.

1275
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,762
I don't want to
see them embarrassed.

1276
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,683
If they're embarrassed,
they'll suffer.

1277
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,525
If they suffer,
they'll make you suffer.

I got a vacation
coming up.

1284
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,886
I'm gonna take the wife
to London, England.

1285
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,485
We've never been there.

1286
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,803
So throw in a couple of
round-trip tickets, first class.

1287

You gotta enjoy yourself.

Why don't you
find your own girl?

1297
01:22:24,720 --> 01:22:25,881

Yeah.

Maybe I don't hear
so good sometimes.

1301

You won't hear anything
if you go on like this.

all you can do</i>

1731
01:53:22,520 --> 01:53:24,568
<i>is put your finger
in the dike and pray.</i>

1732
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:26,483
Put your fingers
in a dyke?

1733
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:29,041
The only place
you can get your fingers

1734
01:53:29,120 --> 01:53:30,485
is in some dyke.

1735
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:33,561
<i>...not by outlawing
the substances,</i>

1736
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,120
<i>but by legalizing
and taxing them.</i>

1737
01:53:36,440 --> 01:53:41,571
<i>These voices say that will drive
out the organized crime element.</i>

1738
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:44,402
<i>I am not one
of those voices.</i>

1739
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:46,209
I know that.
But you know why?

1740
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:49,124
'Cause you got your head
up your culo, that's why.

1741
01:53:49,240 --> 01:53:51,527
That fucking guy,
he never tells the truth.

1742
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:54,763
<i>...splendor of our city
at its best.</i>

1743
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:56,684
TONY: It's those guys, man!

1744
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,922
It's the fucking bankers,
the politicians,

1745
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,241
they're the ones that
wanna make coke illegal

1746
01:54:01,320 --> 01:54:03,004
so they can make
the fucking money

1747
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:04,764
and then get
the fucking votes!

1748
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:08,083
They fighting the bad guys.
They're the bad guys!

1749
01:54:08,360 --> 01:54:10,203
They fuck anything
and anyone.

1750
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:13,449
Can't you stop saying
"fuck" all the time?

1751
01:54:13,600 --> 01:54:16,251
Can't you stop talking about money?
It's boring, Tony.

1752
01:54:16,320 --> 01:54:20,370
Where's this coming from?
Boring? What's boring?

1753
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:22,130
You're boring.
Oh.

1754
01:54:22,520 --> 01:54:25,763
"Money." That's all I
hear in this house.

1755
01:54:26,040 --> 01:54:29,044
Look at these pelicans fly.
Come on, pelicans!

1756
01:54:29,120 --> 01:54:30,167
Here it is.

1757
01:54:30,240 --> 01:54:31,810
Frank never
talked about money.

1758
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,640
That's 'cause
he was so smart.

1759
01:54:42,840 --> 01:54:45,002
(BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH)

1760
01:54:45,880 --> 01:54:47,564
You know what
you're becoming?

1761
01:54:47,640 --> 01:54:51,042
You're an immigrant spic millionaire
who can't stop talking...

1762
01:54:51,120 --> 01:54:54,522
Who the fuck you calling a "spic,"
you white piece of bread?

1763
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:56,090
Get out of the way
of the TV!

1764
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:58,931
Dig a hole in the garden,
bury it, and forget about it.

1765
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:02,443
I work hard for this!
I want you to know that.

1766
01:55:06,360 --> 01:55:08,727
Somebody should've
given it to you.

1767
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,290
You would've
been a nicer person.

1768
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,448
Know what your
problem is, pussycat?

1769
01:55:14,520 --> 01:55:16,124
What is my problem?

1770
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:19,360
You got nothing to do
with your life.

1771
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:23,245
Why don't you get
a job or something?

1772
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:25,683
Do something.
Be a nurse.

1773
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:29,410
Work with blind kids, lepers.
That kind of thing.

1774
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:32,962
Anything beats
lying around all day

1775
01:55:33,040 --> 01:55:34,565
waiting for me
to fuck you!

1776
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:37,686
Don't toot your horn, honey.
You're not that good.

1777
01:55:37,760 --> 01:55:39,888
No? Frank was better?

1778
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:42,690
You're an asshole!

1779
01:55:43,560 --> 01:55:45,528
Where you going?
Come here!

1780
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,441
Elvie!

1781
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:50,491
I was kidding!

1782
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,525
I was only kidding!

1783
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:55,921
I guess
sometimes married life

1784
01:55:56,000 --> 01:55:57,889
is not all
it's cracked up to be.

1785
01:55:58,080 --> 01:55:59,525
Where you going?

1786
01:55:59,640 --> 01:56:00,641
I got a date.

1787
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:03,130
You got a date? Come here. Yeah.

1788
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:10,322
What?

1789
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:11,487
This Seidelbaum thing.

1790
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:13,764
Yeah, it's all set up.

1791
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:16,123
Yeah, well,
you forget it.

1792
01:56:16,200 --> 01:56:18,248
Stay out of it.
I'll take care of it.

1793
01:56:18,320 --> 01:56:21,051
Stay out of it? It's my deal.
I set it up.

1794
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:23,727
You're not a negotiator,
Manny, you know that.

1795
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:26,246
You like the ladies
more than the money.

1796
01:56:26,320 --> 01:56:27,367
That's your problem.

1797
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:30,364
What the fuck are you talking about?
I'm your partner, okay?

1798
01:56:30,440 --> 01:56:32,886
If you don't trust me
with that kind of thing,

1799
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:34,485
who're you gonna trust?

1800
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:35,846
Junior partner.

1801
01:56:37,280 --> 01:56:38,361
Bullshit, man.

1802
01:56:38,440 --> 01:56:40,841
Don't talk to me about
trust, I don't like it.

1803
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:44,000
You should listen to your wife.
She's right.

1804
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:45,809
You are an asshole, man!

1805
01:56:46,760 --> 01:56:49,081
Come here. Give me a kiss.
Come here.

1806
01:56:50,280 --> 01:56:51,770
Fuck you, man!

1807
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:56,367
Who put this thing together?
Me! That's who!

1808
01:56:57,520 --> 01:56:59,727
Who do I trust? Me!

1809
01:57:00,360 --> 01:57:02,408
Fuck him. "Trust."

1810
01:57:02,760 --> 01:57:04,250
(SWITCHING CHANNELS)

1811
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:08,283
Asshole. Fuck called
me an asshole.

1812
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:10,611
I need that shit.

1813
01:57:12,240 --> 01:57:13,765
I don't need him.

1814
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:18,606
I don't need her. Fuck them.
I don't need nobody.

1815
01:57:20,080 --> 01:57:22,287
Back then I worked in
pictures down in Colombia.

1816
01:57:22,360 --> 01:57:25,125
I was in that movie Burn.
You ever see it?

1817
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:27,807
You saw me with
Marlon Brando?

1818
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:28,961
You know,
we're good friends.

1819
01:57:29,080 --> 01:57:30,241
I was his driver.

1820
01:57:30,320 --> 01:57:31,481
No shit?

1821
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:32,681
Brando.

1822
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:35,650
They shot it there.
Cartagena.

1823
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:37,969
Gillo Pontecorvo.
He was the director.

1824
01:57:38,040 --> 01:57:39,121
Italian guy.

1825
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:41,044
Tell me about him.

1826
01:57:41,120 --> 01:57:42,963
I also know
Paul Newman.

1827
01:57:43,400 --> 01:57:44,401
I worked with him
in Tucson.

No?

1833

$283,107.65.

1835
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,802
You want
a company check here?

1836
01:58:08,240 --> 01:58:12,165
I got 284.6.

1837
01:58:12,320 --> 01:58:14,129
That's just
not possible.

The machine

1839

No. Come on.

Business is business.
Come on.

1842
01:58:23,480 --> 01:58:24,970
You're talking
$1,500 here.

1843
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:29,209
Okay, you keep the change.
Okay? I don't give a shit.

1844
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:31,921
I'll count it
again for you.

1845
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:33,201
No, come on.

1846
01:58:33,320 --> 01:58:36,130
This check here,
where does this check go?

1847
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:40,931

1848
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:42,047
Montana what?

We're up to what?

1857
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:29,201
Seven checks.
$1,325,623.

1858
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,082
200,000 more.

1859
01:59:34,160 --> 01:59:35,241
We ought to take a leak.

Freeze!

1861
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:37,765
Get your hands up!

1862

Go against the wall,
turn around.

1863

You're not kidding.

1864
01:59:40,680 --> 01:59:43,843
You're under arrest for
violation of the RICO Statute.

1865
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:45,604
You have the right
to remain silent.

1866
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:48,291
Anything you say can and
will be taken against you.

1867

How do I know
you guys are cops?

1868
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:51,850
What's that say, asshole?

1869
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,284
That's pretty good, man.
Where'd you get that?

1870
01:59:56,440 --> 01:59:57,851
You call yourself
a Cuban?

1871
01:59:57,960 --> 01:59:59,769
You make a real
Cuban throw up!

1872

Call your dog

You see that eye

1876
02:00:08,280 --> 02:00:10,282
Say, "Hi, honey."

I know all that
bullshit, Seidelbaum!

1884

Save your breath.

1885
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:32,491
You got nothing on me.
You know it. I know it.

1886

I'm changing dollar
bills, that's all.

You want to waste my time?
Okay. I call my lawyer.

For what?

1900
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:32,603
Washing money?

1901
02:01:32,720 --> 02:01:34,245
The fucking country was
built on washed money.

1902
02:01:34,360 --> 02:01:35,725
Can't be that bad.

1903
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:36,921
It's not like Cuba.

1904
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:38,240
What the fuck
you talking?

1905
02:01:38,360 --> 02:01:40,089
The jails
are like hotels.

1906
02:01:40,160 --> 02:01:41,571
You kidding me or what?

1907
02:01:41,680 --> 02:01:43,091
You fucking high or what?

1908
02:01:43,160 --> 02:01:44,525
I'll delay the trial.

1909
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:47,803
A year and a half, two years.
You won't even start...

1910
02:01:47,880 --> 02:01:49,041
Fuck you, man!

1911
02:01:49,160 --> 02:01:51,128
I'm not going back
in any cage, okay?

1912
02:01:51,240 --> 02:01:53,049
No way. I been there.

1913
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,085
Okay, look.
(CLEARS THROAT)

1914
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:06,610
I give you $400,000 more.
Okay, now that's $800,000.

1915
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:10,243
With that kind of money, you
can buy the Supreme Court.

1916
02:02:12,920 --> 02:02:16,367
Tony, the law has to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt.

1917
02:02:17,280 --> 02:02:19,726
I'm an expert at
raising that doubt.

1918
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:21,450
But when you got
1.3 million

1919
02:02:21,600 --> 02:02:24,809
undeclared staring into
a videotape camera,

1920
02:02:25,480 --> 02:02:27,847
honey baby, it's hard
to convince a jury

1921
02:02:27,920 --> 02:02:29,490
you found it
in a taxicab.

1922
02:02:53,120 --> 02:02:55,600
I'm so glad you could come
on such short notice.

1923
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:56,841
I really appreciate it.

1924
02:02:56,960 --> 02:02:58,644
It's okay.
How's Elvira?

1925
02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:00,849
Oh, great.
How's your wife?

1926
02:03:00,920 --> 02:03:02,001
Three more months.

1927
02:03:02,160 --> 02:03:03,366
Oh, yeah?
Congratulations.

1928
02:03:03,480 --> 02:03:04,606
How about you?

1929
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:07,411
When you gonna have another
Tony to take your place?

1930
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:08,561
I'm working on it.

1931
02:03:08,640 --> 02:03:10,483
You have to
work harder. Come.

1932
02:03:10,640 --> 02:03:13,007
I want you to meet
some of my friends.

1933
02:03:17,960 --> 02:03:19,246
This is Pedro Quinn,

1934
02:03:19,320 --> 02:03:21,322
chairman of the Andes
Sugar Corporation.

1935
02:03:21,440 --> 02:03:22,726
Pleasure meeting you.

1936
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:23,881
Nice to meet you.

1937
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:27,368
General Edward Strasser, Commander
of the First Army Corps.

1938
02:03:27,720 --> 02:03:28,767
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

1939
02:03:28,880 --> 02:03:30,086
Pleasure.

1940
02:03:30,160 --> 02:03:32,208
This is Ariel Bleyer,

1941
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:35,324
with the Ministry of the Interior.
Tony Montana.

1942
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:41,371
And here is our friend Charles
Goodson from Washington.

1943
02:03:41,680 --> 02:03:42,727
Nice to meet you.

1944
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:44,325
How do you do,
Mr. Montana?

1945
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:46,845
SOSA: Sit here, Tony.

1946
02:03:50,640 --> 02:03:51,880
Gentlemen.

1947
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,729
I would like to
discuss something

1948
02:03:57,840 --> 02:03:59,842
that is of interest
to all of us here.

1949
02:04:01,160 --> 02:04:02,844
You have a problem, Tony.

1950
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:06,889
We have a problem.

1951
02:04:08,080 --> 02:04:10,890
I think together we can
solve all our problems.

1952
02:04:13,080 --> 02:04:15,606
We all know you have tax
troubles in your country

1953
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:18,411
and that you may have
to do a little time.

1954
02:04:19,040 --> 02:04:20,644
We have friends
in Washington

1955
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:23,803
that assure us these troubles
can be taken care of.

1956
02:04:23,880 --> 02:04:27,407
You may have to pay some
back taxes, a big fine,

1957
02:04:28,200 --> 02:04:30,328
but there will be
no prison.

1958
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,047
Okay.

1959
02:04:32,920 --> 02:04:34,888
So what's
your problem, Alex?

1960
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:37,729
I'll show you
my problem.

1961
02:04:38,280 --> 02:04:41,443
<i>INTERVIEWER: I've heard about financial
support your government receives</i>

1962
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:43,369
<i>from the drug industry
in Bolivia.</i>

1963
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:46,728

is that this money,</i>

1964
02:04:46,840 --> 02:04:48,410
<i>which is
in the billions,</i>

1965
02:04:48,560 --> 02:04:50,324

1970
02:05:00,760 --> 02:05:02,888

<i>At the same time,</i>

02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:07,770

1976

a <i>large purchase

02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:25,401
<i>This charming face here

<i>He is the Minister of the

1980
02:05:29,440 --> 02:05:31,807
<i>And General Cucombre just
a couple months ago</i>

1981
02:05:31,960 --> 02:05:36,761
<i>bought a $12 million villa on
Lake Lucerne in Switzerland.</i>

1982
02:05:37,280 --> 02:05:38,486

02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:39,686

<i>Guarding cash registers?</i>

1986
02:05:44,760 --> 02:05:47,730
<i>This man here,
Alejandro Sosa,</i>

1987
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:49,086
<i>a very interesting character.</i>

1988

<i>He's a wealthy landowner,</i>

1992

<i>He's not your

1993
02:06:04,160 --> 02:06:06,242
<i>INTERVIEWER:

1994

(SWITCHES OFF TV)

1995
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:10,366
He's scheduled
for 60 Minutes next.

1996
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:16,484
He is going on French, British,
Italian, Japanese television.

1997
02:06:17,080 --> 02:06:20,004
People everywhere are
starting to listen to him.

1998
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:22,164
It's embarrassing, Tony.

1999
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:26,681
That is our problem.

2000
02:06:29,320 --> 02:06:31,561
You remember Alberto,
don't you?

2001
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:34,609
How could I forget him?

2002
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:38,688
Alberto is an expert
in the disposal business.

2003
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:42,047
He's going to help us
fix our problem.

2004
02:06:43,840 --> 02:06:45,842
But he doesn't
speak English.

2005
02:06:46,560 --> 02:06:49,564
He doesn't know his way
around the States too well.

2006
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:51,763
He needs a little help.

2007
02:06:54,040 --> 02:06:55,929
Is that a problem, Tony?

2008
02:07:01,880 --> 02:07:03,450
No problem.

2009
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:07,121
Good.

2010
02:07:22,480 --> 02:07:26,485
So what's the big mystery
with the Bolivian situation?

2011
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:29,844
You gonna tell me what
happened with Sosa, or what?

2012
02:07:30,040 --> 02:07:33,362
A lot of bullshit,
that's what happened.

2013
02:07:34,240 --> 02:07:35,401
Politics.

2014
02:07:40,200 --> 02:07:43,488
I want you to stay
down here for a while.

2015
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,409
Run things for me.

2016
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:49,322
I gotta go to
New York next week.

2017
02:07:55,680 --> 02:07:56,920
Fuck this, man.

2018
02:07:57,040 --> 02:07:59,930
I don't like it, man.
I don't like this at all.

2019
02:08:00,040 --> 02:08:01,724
You don't like it?

2020
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:08,003
You got me into this
mess in the first place.

2021

With that fucking
Seidelbaum, that right?

2022
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:13,285
With Seidelbaum?

2023
02:08:13,400 --> 02:08:15,607
What does Seidelbaum
have to do with Sosa?

2024
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:18,445
How do you connect
those two?

2025
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:21,446
Why don't you eat your food?
What's wrong with it?

2026
02:08:21,560 --> 02:08:23,608
I'm not hungry.

2027
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:25,361
You're not hungry?

2028
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:27,283
Do you even know
about the trial?

2029
02:08:27,440 --> 02:08:29,169
What did you
order it for, then?

2030
02:08:29,240 --> 02:08:31,561
I lost my appetite.

2031
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:38,285

that Sheffield said

a postponement?

Is this it? That's
what it's all about?

2035
02:08:55,320 --> 02:08:58,722
Eating, drinking,

2036
02:08:59,240 --> 02:09:01,402
fucking, sucking...

2037

Come on, man.

2038
02:09:02,920 --> 02:09:04,251
Snorting?

2039
02:09:04,320 --> 02:09:05,481
Then what?

2040
02:09:07,160 --> 02:09:09,003
Tell me. Then what?

2041
02:09:09,960 --> 02:09:14,443
You're 50. You got
a bag for a belly.

2042
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:18,650
You got tits,
you need a bra.

2043
02:09:19,480 --> 02:09:21,005
They got hair on them.

2044
02:09:22,240 --> 02:09:25,608
You got a liver,
and they got spots on it

2045
02:09:25,680 --> 02:09:27,762
and you're eating
this fucking shit

2046
02:09:28,280 --> 02:09:31,807
and you're looking like these
rich fucking mummies in here.

2047
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,685
Come on. It's not so bad.
It could be worse.

2048
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:36,691
Is this what
it's all about?

2049
02:09:36,760 --> 02:09:37,841
Forget it.

2050
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:41,044
This what I work for?
Tell me.

2051
02:09:46,600 --> 02:09:47,886
Look at that.

2052
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:50,291
A junkie.

2053
02:09:52,040 --> 02:09:56,409
I got a fucking junkie for a wife.
She don't eat nothing.

2054
02:09:57,600 --> 02:10:01,366
Sleeps all day with
them black shades on.

2055
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:04,326
Wakes up
with a Quaalude...

2056
02:10:04,440 --> 02:10:05,726
Don't pick on her, man.

2057
02:10:05,840 --> 02:10:09,561
...and who won't fuck me
'cause she's in a coma.

2058
02:10:11,240 --> 02:10:13,641
I can't even
have a kid with her.

2059
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:16,451
Her womb
is so polluted,

2060
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:19,530
I can't even have a fucking
little baby with her!

2061
02:10:19,600 --> 02:10:21,921
You son of a bitch!

2062
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:24,564
You fuck!

2063
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:26,331
You shouldn't talk
like that.

2064
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:28,607
How dare you talk
to me like that!

2065
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:32,287
What makes you
so much better than me?

2066
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:34,046
What do you do?
Don't worry.

2067
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:36,361
You deal drugs
and you kill people.

2068
02:10:36,440 --> 02:10:37,771

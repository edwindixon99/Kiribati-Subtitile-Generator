1
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,810
- Tag. You're it.
- You're it.

2
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,180
- No, I tagged you last.
- Uh-uh.

3
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:33,560
- Wanna go fishing?
- No fish. They're frozen.

4
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,770
- No, they don't freeze.
- What do they do? Just die?

5
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,990
- No. Hey, look at this car.
- Wow. A beauty.

6
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:43,950
- Isn't that neat? It's a Ford.
- It's not a Ford.

7
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,740
Yeah, it is. Then what is it?

8
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,660
I don't know, but it's not a Ford.
I've been in one.

9
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:11,020
Hey, Leonard, what are you doing?
What's it look like?

10
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,180
Somebody might be coming.

11
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,600
Keep a lookout, James.

12
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:19,150
- No one's here.
- No one's coming.

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,780
- My turn's next.
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

14
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,910
What's wrong, Leonard?

15
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,360
Leonard, honey.

16
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,610
- What?
- Better get dressed.

17
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,610
Your breakfast is just about ready.

18
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,780
- Come on. We'll be late.
- Hi, Albert. James.

19
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,740
Hurry up.

20
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,450
- Hi, Mr. Dylan.
- Morning.

21
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,870
They won't let me play with them.

22
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,090
- You always study.
- Of course he does.

23
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,430
- I'm a natural at this stuff.
- Let's see you pass the test.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,260
We're going to begin today
with a history test.

25
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:36,850
Keep your eyes on your own papers
and at the recess bell

26
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,230
bring your composition books
up to my desk.

27
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:37,040
So, what are we gonna do today?
I don't know.

28
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, hello, boys.

29
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,590
Hi, Mrs. Lowe.
Can Leonard come and play today?

30
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,550
Oh, no, I'm sorry. Better not today.

31
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,260
Well, how about tomorrow?

32
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,880
I'm afraid he won't be well
by then either.

33
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,760
- When will he be well?
- I don't know.

34
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,690
Thanks for coming by.

35
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,350
Good morning, Bainbridge Hospital,
may I help you?

36
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,310
One moment, please.

37
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,640
Excuse me...
You gotta ask her.

38
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:27,440
Good morning, Bainbridge Hospital,
may I help you?

39
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:30,320
Oh, Dr. Horowitz,
can you hold the line?

40
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,360
Bainbridge Hospital,
can I help you?

41
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,490
Yes. Dr. Franklin and Dr. Tyler
are in a board meeting.

42
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,120
Can I take a message,
or would you like...? Bye.

43
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,830
Yes?

44
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,040
Yes, I'm Dr. Malcolm Sayer.
I have an appointment.

45
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:45,790
Take a seat, please.

46
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,830
Bainbridge Hospital,
may I help you?

47
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,800
Thank you.
Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?

48
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,550
I can connect you to the cafeteria
but they will have to page him.

49
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,720
Thank you.
Bainbridge Hospital, may I help you?

50
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:02,510
Dr. Franklin and Dr. Tyler
are in the boardroom.

51
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,980
I can take messages, or you can
call back in about 45 minutes.

52
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,230
When you say "people,"
you mean living people?

53
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,980
Mm-hm.

54
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,950
Well, I'm here to apply
for a research position

55
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,910
in your neurology lab.

56
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,080
Neurology lab?

57
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,660
We have an x-ray room.

58
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:27,790
This is a chronic hospital, doctor.
The position is for staff neurologist.

59
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,630
You will be working with
patients, people. Yes.

60
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,750
A "doctor" doctor.
Doctor.

61
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,510
Carmel Institute? Tell me about that.
Anything with patients there?

62
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,590
Earthworms.
I'm sorry?

63
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,800
It was an immense project.

64
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:46,180
I was to extract one decagram
of myelin from 4 tons of earthworms.

65
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:47,850
Really?
Yes.

66
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,940
I was on that project
for five years.

67
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:55,030
I was the only one who believed in it.
Everyone said it couldn't be done.

68
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:58,900
It can't.
I know that now. I proved it.

69
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,370
Maybe before, at St. Thomas?

70
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,910
All research?
Oh, yes.

71
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,210
This isn't going to work.
Ben, we're totally understaffed.

72
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:11,460
He's never worked
with human beings.

73
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,920
His research talents
would be wasted here.

74
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,010
If it wasn't a state law...
Excuse me. But, uh...

75
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,050
You're clearly looking for someone
with more of a clinical background.

76
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,100
As much as I need a job, there must be more
applicants suitable for this position.

77
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,100
Thank you, anyway.
Dr. Sayer, back in medical school.

78
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:34,820
You couldn't have graduated
without some clinical experience.

79
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,940
You took a pulse, you took
a temperature. You did diagnosis.

80
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,410
Oh.
Well, there you have it then.

81
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,410
You do want the job, don't you?

82
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,460
Hey, it's this way, doc.

83
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:55,340
You spend much time
at chronic hospitals?

84
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,090
I, um...

85
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,340
You'd remember.
Guess not then.

86
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,640
- Hi.
- Hey, Christina.

87
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,390
You see, doc, we got MS,
Tourette syndrome,

88
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,100
Parkinson's disease.

89
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,270
Some of them,
we ain't even got a name for.

90
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:15,150
How are you?

91
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,070
What are all these people
waiting for?

92
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,280
Nothing.

93
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,110
How do they get well?
They don't, they're chronic.

94
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,280
We call this place the Garden.
Why?

95
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:26,120
Because all we do
is feed and water them.

96
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,490
Thanks, man.

97
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,120
Mr. Kean, I would like to ask...

98
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,290
I was born in 1911
in Kingsbridge, New York.

99
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,630
I came here in July 1955.

100
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,470
Prior to July 1955, I resided
at the Brooklyn Psychiatric Center,

101
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,840
Brooklyn, New York.
Prior to that, I was a person.

102
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,890
No, I'm not gonna hurt you.

103
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:26,010
Gets easier.

104
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:29,260
You don't think it will, but it does.

105
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,050
Oh, no, Buttercup. Oh, good.

106
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,930
No, go to your house. Go. Go.

107
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,140
Go home.

108
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:15,930
Good.

109
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,610
Good morning, doctor.

110
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,870
I have a new arrival for you.

111
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,620
She was brought in late last night.
Here's her file.

112
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:30,840
Hello. I'm Dr. Sayer.

113
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,140
Do you know where you are?

114
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,770
Can you hear me?

115
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,940
"Diagnosis."

116
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,040
"Medical insurance." Hm.

117
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,210
Oh, God.

118
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,330
Her name is Lucy Fishman.

119
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,550
She was found by neighbors with her sister
several days after her sister died.

120
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,630
She has no other
living relatives

121
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,590
and they say she has
always been as she is now,

122
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,430
with no response
or comprehension.

123
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,810
And yet...

124
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,480
A reflex.

125
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,110
If she batted it away,
I might call it a reflex.

126
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,070
But she didn't. She caught it.

127
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,030
It's still a reflex, doctor.

128
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,360
I'm sorry. If you were right,
I would agree with you.

129
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,490
It's as if, having lost
all will of her own to act,

130
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,910
she borrows the will of the ball.

131
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,990
The will of the ball?

132
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,750
Excuse me.

133
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:49,120
This is ridiculous.

134
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,170
Trying to make
a good impression, right?

135
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,340
A good impression.
That's it, isn't it?

136
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,550
You're still settling in.

137
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:01,930
Miss Costello, will you see to it that Dr.
Sayer's patients that are waiting outside

138
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,720
are rescheduled for tomorrow.
Yes, sir.

139
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:07,980
Borrows the will of the ball.

140
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,150
That's great.

141
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,610
Okay. Thanks. Thank you.
Okay.

142
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,490
Let us know
if she catches anything else.

143
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,720
I'll be fired.

144
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:47,140
It's all right. I'll go back to school.

145
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,940
Did I forget something?
No.

146
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,320
I just wanted to say to you
I preferred your explanation

147
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,900
and that I'll look after things
for you until you've settled in.

148
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:03,910
Good night, doctor.

149
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,080
Thank you.

150
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,330
Thank you very much.

151
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,850
Hello.
Hi.

152
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,860
I'm Dr. Sayer.
I'm Waheedah.

153
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,780
Waheedah. How are you today?
I'm fine, thank you.

154
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,870
Yes. Oh, sorry. What form?

155
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:51,410
Yes, I'll hold.

156
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,080
Mm-hm.

157
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:02,760
Oh. Okay. Three, two.

158
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,510
Oh, thank you.

159
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,140
Bye.

160
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:17,650
Hello.

161
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,580
- Contact.
- Roger.

162
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,670
Yippee! We made it, Orville.
We're in orbit.

163
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,050
Oh, goody.
Now we can try being weightless.

164
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,720
Let's celebrate
with delicious Nestlé's Quik.

165
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,600
Nothing makes chocolatey milk
like Quik, you know?

166
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,520
That great Nestlé's chocolate flavor
is out of this world.

167
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,810
Out of this world.

168
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,570
Hello, up there. Time to recharge
with delicious Nestlé's Quik.

169
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:37,060
Lucy. Um...

170
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,850
You're out of the hole.

171
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,740
Um, could...?
Anthony.

172
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,120
Anthony.

173
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,290
Could you help me move this?

174
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,980
Excuse me.

175
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,460
Lucy, you're almost there.

176
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,080
Come on.

177
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,420
Lucy.

178
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,810
Here's the water, Lucy.

179
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,900
Here it is, Lucy.

180
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,650
The water is...

181
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,160
I don't know why your nails
grow so fast.

182
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,830
It must be all that Jell-O
they give you.

183
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,500
Jell-O, Jell-O. Day after day.

184
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,260
Red Jell-O, yellow Jell-O.
Every day, Jell-O.

185
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,930
Hurry up. You don't wanna miss
the laundry truck.

186
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,350
I forgot to tell you,
Mrs. Cooper passed away.

187
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,350
Remember her?
She was nice.

188
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,560
Always a kind word.

189
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,860
Her dog I could have
done without.

190
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,690
Excuse me.

191
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,860
Hello.

192
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,990
Does he ever speak to you?

193
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,870
Of course not. Not in words.

194
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,080
He speaks to you in other ways?

195
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,330
How do you mean?

196
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,000
You don't have children.

197
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,630
No.

198
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,220
If you did, you would know.

199
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,430
This is "atypical schizophrenia."

200
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:26,520
"Atypical hysteria," this one.

201
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,400
"Atypical nerve impairment."

202
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,950
"No change since
last examination."

203
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,780
"No change or therapy
recommended."

204
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,950
That's very nice.

205
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,910
This one is "no change,"
dated 9-11-44.

206
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,670
Sorry.

207
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,840
That's 25 years.

208
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,050
You'd think, at a certain point,
all these atypical somethings

209
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,930
would amount
to a typical something.

210
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,010
Uh-huh.
But a typical what?

211
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Doctor?
Yes?

212
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,180
Wanna go for a cup of coffee
somewhere or something?

213
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,440
Tea?

214
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,110
Oh, normally, I would say yes.

215
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,440
I made other plans.

216
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,650
Right, right, right.

217
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,280
Well, some other time. All right.
Oh, yes.

218
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm over here. Good night.
I'm right there. Night.

219
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,290
"Encephalitis lethargica."

220
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,880
Where is it? Where is it?

221
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,930
"Encephalitis lethargica."

222
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:25,220
Oh, I'm sorry, doctor.
I thought someone left the lights on.

223
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,430
I found it. I found the connection.

224
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,270
They all survived encephalitis.

225
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,440
Years before they came here.
See? In the 1920s.

226
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,860
That's very nice. Yes.
Isn't it wonderful?

227
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,360
I'll come back later.
Please.

228
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,220
How many have you found there?

229
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,600
Five, and I believe
there are more.

230
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,390
How are they?

231
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,400
Just as you described them back
then, "insubstantial as ghosts."

232
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:23,450
Only I guess many of them
were children then.

233
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,250
Yes. Children who fell asleep.

234
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:36,790
Most died during the acute stage
of the illness.

235
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:40,760
Those who survived, who awoke,

236
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,260
seemed fine,
as though nothing had happened.

237
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,680
We just didn't realize

238
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:49,850
how much the infection
had damaged the brain.

239
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:56,110
Years went by, five, 10, 15,

240
00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:02,200
before these strange
neurological symptoms would appear.

241
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,280
But they did.

242
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:09,450
I began to see them
in the early 1930s.

243
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,540
Old people brought in
by their children.

244
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:18,130
Young people brought in
by their parents.

245
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,840
They could no longer
dress themselves

246
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,220
or feed themselves.

247
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:27,640
They could no longer speak
in most cases.

248
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:29,640
Some families went mad.

249
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:35,140
People who were normal
were now...

250
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,860
elsewhere.

251
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,150
What's it like to be them?

252
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,490
What are they thinking?

253
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:47,820
They're not.

254
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:53,410
The virus didn't spare
their higher faculties.

255
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,250
We know that for a fact?
Yes.

256
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,090
Because?

257
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,880
Because the alternative
is unthinkable.

258
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,760
- He has a crush on you.
- Oh, stop.

259
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,260
- He does.
- No, he doesn't.

260
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,100
- He asked for your number.
- Come on.

261
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,640
He did.

262
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,940
Ow!

263
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:11,450
I'm all for fixing this place up,
but what are we doing?

264
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,240
I have a hunch.

265
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,120
Oh, excuse me. Sorry.
Excuse me. Sorry.

266
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,960
What's stopping Lucy
from crossing to the fountain?

267
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,460
Nothing.
Exactly.

268
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,460
The visual field just stops.

269
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,960
There's a void. There's no pattern.
No visual rhythm.

270
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:28,550
Nothing to compel her
to keep going.

271
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,260
So we're making something.

272
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,470
Exactly.

273
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,020
All right, Lucy.

274
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,780
She's... Yes.

275
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,520
She's looking out the...

276
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,530
Where's that article? Where is it?

277
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,160
This the right issue?

278
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:41,660
This is last year's. I can't find it.

279
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:47,590
I'd like to know more about your son.
Certainly.

280
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:55,850
Something was wrong, they said,
with his hands.

281
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,060
He couldn't write anymore.

282
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,390
He couldn't do the work.

283
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:04,020
I should take him out of school,
they said.

284
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,520
He was 11.

285
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:09,070
Slowly, he got worse.

286
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,690
He'd call me and I'd come in.

287
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:15,030
And he'd be sitting at his desk
in a trance.

288
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,280
One hour, two hours.

289
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,870
Then he'd be okay again.

290
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,290
One day I came home from work,
found him in his bed.

291
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:29,460
He kept saying, "Mom. Mom."

292
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,300
His arm like this, reaching.

293
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,590
"What do you want, Leonard?"

294
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,390
He never spoke again.

295
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,060
It was like he disappeared.

296
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:45,810
Later that year,
I took him to Bainbridge.

297
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,610
It was November 14th, 1939.

298
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,240
He was 20 years old.

299
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:59,950
What did he do for those nine years
he was in this room, Mrs. Lowe?

300
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,910
He read.

301
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,750
He loved to read.

302
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,250
He read all the time.

303
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,040
Really?

304
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,340
Well, that's all he could do.

305
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,820
That's enough.

306
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:39,370
Leonard.

307
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,700
All right, Leonard, we're finished.

308
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:52,130
Nothing, nothing, nothing
and nothing.

309
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,630
Don't tell me. It's one of your statues.
Exactly.

310
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,970
How did I guess that?

311
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,930
Pass the salt, will you?

312
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,560
But what about this?

313
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:07,230
Heh, heh. What do you mean "this"?
It's a strobe.

314
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,520
You're wrong.

315
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,520
All of this before is the strobe.
This is me saying his name to him.

316
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,490
Excuse me.

317
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,660
What does that mean?

318
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,170
Hey!
Sorry.

319
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,180
Right down the middle.
Hum it in there. Hum it in there.

320
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,930
Home run. Home run.

321
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,010
I can catch a ball.

322
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,680
Hey, doc, throw me the ball.

323
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,560
Throw me the ball.
Throw me the ball.

324
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,730
Get back.
Hey, I can catch a ball.

325
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,820
- Doc. Hey.
- I said, get back.

326
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,990
- Is this all of them?
- Yes.

327
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,280
Bring them in here with the others.

328
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,550
I should have given David
his divorce.

329
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,930
I just thought he really would want
to be a father to his son.

330
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,020
Excuse me.

331
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,980
The patients have been given
their morning medication.

332
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,940
That's good.

333
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:38,190
Dr. Sayer was hoping you'd have some free time.
Wanna come with me, please.

334
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,240
Beth?
Yeah.

335
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:47,160
One of the most beautiful arias
ever written.

336
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:50,120
Watch them closely
for any reactions.

337
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,940
"Call me Ishmael.

338
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:23,110
Years ago,
never mind how long precisely,

339
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:25,160
having little or no money

340
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,200
and nothing particular
to interest me on shore..."

341
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,290
Leonard, I know you can hear me.

342
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:36,290
I want you to try and respond
when I speak your name.

343
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,420
See, it's not just any music.

344
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:43,760
It has to be the music
that's right for them.

345
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:55,020
It's like they're only moved
by music that moves them.

346
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,730
I haven't found anything
that moves Bert yet.

347
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,160
They'll sit like that all day
if I let them.

348
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,960
I have to play the first card.

349
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:24,880
L.

350
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,300
Leonard.

351
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,220
L.

352
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,500
This is Frank.

353
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,380
If you could just me help me
get him to his feet.

354
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:04,880
There's something else
that reaches him.

355
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:07,340
What?
Human contact.

356
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,140
If you could just stand over there
for a minute.

357
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:14,140
He can't walk without me.
If I let go of him, he'll fall.

358
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,430
I'm not gonna let you fall.

359
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,520
But...

360
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,610
he'll walk with me anywhere.

361
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,650
It's like the ball,
only it's my will he's borrowing.

362
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:31,570
The will of another human being.

363
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,420
Just let it glide.

364
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,420
Gentle. Gentle.

365
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:02,350
I'll begin by moving the pointer to L,
for Leonard.

366
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:07,480
When you begin to move the pointer,
I'll stop and you take over.

367
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:09,490
Do you understand?

368
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,450
All right. I'm beginning.

369
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:17,370
Very good.

370
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,760
No, maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

371
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,760
My fault. I, uh...

372
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,930
I.

373
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,310
L. Oh, good, good.

374
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,270
Now the E.

375
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,440
K.

376
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,570
Dyslexia.

377
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:55,160
E. Good, good.

378
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,160
S.

379
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,160
P.

380
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:06,710
You're spelling something else.

381
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,530
Rilke.

382
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:59,890
His gaze
From staring through the bars

383
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:05,100
Has grown so weary
That it can take in nothing more

384
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:09,270
For him, it is as though
There were a thousand bars

385
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,070
And behind the thousand bars
No world

386
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,450
As he paces in cramped circles
Over and over

387
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:22,490
His powerful strides
Are like a ritual dance

388
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,750
Around a center
Where a great will stands paralyzed

389
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:33,420
At times, the curtains of the eye
Lift without a sound

390
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:35,050
And a shape enters

391
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:38,390
Slips through the tightened silence
Of the shoulders

392
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,970
Reaches the heart, and dies

393
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,440
Have you heard of
the drug L-dopa?

394
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:54,780
What?
It's a synthetic dopamine.

395
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:59,910
Oh, yes, I did.
For Parkinson's patients, yeah. Why?

396
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,120
Nothing.

397
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,490
Sign the petition now.
Thousands of young men

398
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,290
are dying every day.
Sorry.

399
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,790
Help us get out of this illegal war.
Sign up now.

400
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,710
A hundred years would pass

401
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,710
before modern neuropathology
would even allow us

402
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:19,340
to actually locate the damage
in the Parkinsonian brain.

403
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,220
Yes.

404
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:25,020
With our development
of the drug L-dopa,

405
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,230
we can, for the first time,

406
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,230
promise the Parkinsonian patient
a more normal life.

407
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,320
By administering L...

408
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,240
Thank you. Yes, um...

409
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,490
I'm very curious about this drug,

410
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:44,160
and I wonder if you've come across
anyone who might have...

411
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,700
Excuse me, doctor?

412
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:52,540
Sayer. I'm curious if you've come
across any patients with encephalitis?

413
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:56,420
After I'm through, Dr. Sayer.
If you wouldn't mind.

414
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,010
- Excuse me.
- As I was saying,

415
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:06,180
by administering L-dopa...

416
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,690
Do you think a Parkinsonian tremor
taken to its extreme,

417
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,190
would appear as no tremor at all?

418
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:22,860
You talking to me?
Oh, yes.

419
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,160
Imagine you accelerated
a Parkinsonian hand tremor

420
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,080
to the point of immobility in the...

421
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,460
Suppose there's a patient

422
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:37,050
with Parkinsonian compulsions
accelerated:

423
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:40,880
The hand tremor, the head bobbing,
ticking, quickening of speech.

424
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,340
Might they not all cave in
on themselves

425
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:46,100
and, in effect,
turn a person into stone?

426
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,390
I don't know. Maybe.

427
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:55,270
Well, do you think L-dopa
would help the situation?

428
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,230
Dr. Sayers, right?
Heh, heh.

429
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,200
I'm just a chemist, doctor.
You're the physician.

430
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:06,030
I'll leave it to you to do the damage.

431
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,170
You know, Freud believed in miracles,
prescribing cocaine like candy.

432
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,000
We all believed in cortisone,

433
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:21,420
till our patients
went psychotic on it.

434
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,760
And now it's L-dopa?

435
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:25,800
With all due respect, it's
rather too soon to say that.

436
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,510
Well, with all due respect,

437
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,890
I think it's rather way
too soon to say that.

438
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,190
Let the chemists do the damage,
doctor.

439
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,810
But I...

440
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:49,950
Dr. Kaufman?
Yeah.

441
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,120
Did you read this case?

442
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:54,920
"New drug lets shaking
palsy patients eat Jell-O."

443
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:58,380
Yes, I read them, doctor.
I read them all. Dutifully, soberly.

444
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,710
All 30 cases had Parkinson's.
Mild Parkinson's.

445
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,050
Your Parkies,
if that's what they are,

446
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,800
haven't moved in decades.

447
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,220
Look at it again, sir.

448
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:14,980
Now, you know better
than to make a leap like that.

449
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:19,230
You want there to be a connection.
That doesn't mean there is one.

450
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:24,360
What I believe, what I know,
is these people are alive inside.

451
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,200
How do you know that, doctor?
Because they catch tennis balls?

452
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:34,830
I know it.

453
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,500
How many did you think
I'd let you put on it?

454
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,840
All of them.

455
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,010
Some. One.

456
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,890
One. With the family's consent,
signed.

457
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,940
Leonard has Parkinson's disease?

458
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,900
No. Um...

459
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,120
Well, his symptoms
are like Parkinson's,

460
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,620
but then again, they're not.

461
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:18,040
Then what will this medicine do
for him?

462
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:23,040
I don't know what it will do for him,
if anything at all.

463
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,920
What do you think it'll do?

464
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:31,300
I'm not sure, because it was designed
for a totally different disorder.

465
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,430
What do you hope it'll do?

466
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:39,310
I hope it'll bring him back
from wherever he is.

467
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,520
To what?

468
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:46,990
To the world.

469
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,120
What's there here for him
after all these years?

470
00:43:56,750 --> 00:43:58,080
You.

471
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,460
You're here.

472
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:41,160
All of it, please.

473
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,810
At 200 milligrams,
he showed no response.

474
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:04,060
Maybe the acid
in the juice neutralized it.

475
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,480
Maybe he needs more.
Maybe he needs less.

476
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,240
I'll try it in milk.

477
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,070
Five hundred milligrams.

478
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,620
Mets 2, Giants 2. Bottom half...

479
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,410
I'll call if there's any change.

480
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:01,540
Yes.

481
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,830
Here's the pitch, on the way.

482
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,090
It's swung on. A high fly ball.

483
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,920
Thank you.

484
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,100
Night, Sara.
Good night.

485
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,720
It's quiet.

486
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,060
It's late.

487
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,060
Everyone's asleep.

488
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,940
I'm not asleep.

489
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:25,700
No. You're awake.

490
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,040
May I?

491
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:57,610
Me.

492
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:05,720
Leonard.

493
00:51:09,970 --> 00:51:12,350
There's someone here to see you.

494
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,740
Ma. Ma.

495
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,040
Mom.

496
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,540
Oh, my baby.

497
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:58,560
My name is Eleanor.

498
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,810
Eleanor.

499
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:09,820
It's a pleasure to meet you.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

500
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:18,790
Ladies? Please.
Oh, now what did I do?

501
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,580
Oh, my goodness.

502
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,460
How do you do, sir?

503
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,680
My name is Margaret.

504
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,760
Margaret.

505
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:36,680
Beth.
Beth.

506
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:43,690
Anthony.

507
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:49,940
Anthony, how are you?

508
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:54,280
Great, man. How are you?

509
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:58,160
Great too.
Ha, ha, ha.

510
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:00,660
All right, man.

511
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:03,580
You meet him?
Didn't he look good?

512
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,130
Yeah.

513
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,130
- Don't eat so fast.
- He's doing fine.

514
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:13,890
I mean, he's starving, right?
He was starving.

515
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:17,260
I don't think I could deal with losing
30 years of my life. Could you?

516
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:19,470
I can't even imagine it.

517
00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:23,900
- Potatoes?
- Hey.

518
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:27,610
Come on, try something else.
He does realize it, doesn't he?

519
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,910
Now, Leonard,
turn this way, please.

520
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,330
It's a camera called
a Polaroid.

521
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:40,120
Thank you.

522
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:44,170
Takes a picture
in less than a minute.

523
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:45,580
Amazing.

524
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,630
Now, if you could try this.

525
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,180
Splendid, that's wonderful.

526
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:59,640
I'd like you to walk now
to the end of the room.

527
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:02,390
Good. Ready?

528
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,850
Go.

529
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,400
Very good.

530
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:14,700
And back now.

531
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:20,790
Dr. Sheck to X-ray.
Dr. Sheck to the X-ray.

532
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:24,870
That was very quick, really.
Let me get some more film.

533
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:23,930
You have to at least lay down.

534
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:25,980
You need the rest.

535
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,070
I'm afraid to close my eyes.

536
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:40,110
If I close my eyes, I'll...
You'll sleep.

537
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:45,410
When you wake up in the morning,
it'll be the next morning.

538
00:55:46,370 --> 00:55:47,790
I promise.

539
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:54,500
Happiest day, man.
Far out.

540
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,420
Yes, I...

541
00:57:57,420 --> 00:57:59,420
Look out.
Poison.

542
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,840
What a wonderful place
the Bronx has become.

543
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:23,360
That's my school.
Really?

544
00:58:31,950 --> 00:58:35,460
Is that classical?
You pick any type of music you want.

545
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:43,380
What's that?
It's rock 'n' roll.

546
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,300
Come on.
No.

547
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:13,950
Come on.
Go get it, boy. Go get it.

548
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,040
Attaboy.
Come on, give it back.

549
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,970
Come on in.
No, no.

550
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:13,180
Come back in. Something happened
while you've been away.

551
01:00:13,350 --> 01:00:15,470
Pollution. I don't think this is wise.

552
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,560
Leonard, that's not wading,
that's swimming. Come on, Leonard.

553
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:23,650
Leonard, I don't know if the
hospital is covered for this.

554
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:25,940
Leonard.

555
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,200
Come on.
No, no. Not...

556
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,280
Come on in.

557
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,710
Leonard, the tide's coming in.

558
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:58,310
That's the periodic table
of elements.

559
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:01,440
I can date my introduction
to science by that.

560
01:01:02,690 --> 01:01:05,440
It's wonderful, really. It's...

561
01:01:05,940 --> 01:01:08,150
It's the universe at its essence.

562
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,860
You see,
you have your alkaline metals.

563
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,950
You have your halogens,
your inert gases.

564
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:16,370
Every element has its place
in that order.

565
01:01:16,540 --> 01:01:18,790
You can't change that.

566
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:22,460
They're secure, no matter what.

567
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,000
You're not married?

568
01:01:25,540 --> 01:01:26,920
Me?

569
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,170
No.

570
01:01:30,260 --> 01:01:32,630
I'm not very good with people.

571
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,470
I, um...

572
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,140
I never have been, Leonard.

573
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:38,970
I like them.

574
01:01:40,890 --> 01:01:45,020
I wish I could say I had more than a
rudimentary understanding of them.

575
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:50,780
Maybe if they were
less unpredictable.

576
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:54,910
Eleanor would disagree with you.

577
01:01:56,950 --> 01:02:00,160
Eleanor?
Miss Costello.

578
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:04,330
Oh, of course.

579
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:07,500
She's spoken to you about me?

580
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:13,220
What did she say?

581
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,840
That you are a kind man.

582
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:21,020
That you care very much for people.

583
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:29,480
I'd like to put the rest
of the group on the drug.

584
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:31,780
I realize this may be
somewhat expensive.

585
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,900
When you say expensive,
you have any idea how much money?

586
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:38,620
Yes, I talked to Ray.
I have an estimate, um...

587
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:41,870
Thank you. The pharmacist says

588
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:47,790
to put the others on the same dosage
as Mr. Lowe would be, um, 12,000.

589
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:50,920
How much?
$12,000.

590
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:52,210
A month?
Yes.

591
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,130
I can't go before the board with that,
doctor.

592
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,720
I was thinking of speaking directly
to the patrons.

593
01:02:58,890 --> 01:03:02,100
The few patrons this hospital has
already give what they can.

594
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:05,480
We'll convince them to give more
than they're accustomed to giving.

595
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:11,650
Perhaps if they see Mr. Lowe.
I think you overestimate the effect

596
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:15,400
that Mr. Lowe has on people, doctor.
We're talking about money.

597
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:00,160
There was an extreme rigidity
of the axial musculature.

598
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:03,120
A gross impairment
of the postural reflexes.

599
01:04:03,280 --> 01:04:07,290
An autonomic dysfunction.
It is a brain stem type of rigidity.

600
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:08,790
A meningismus.

601
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:12,920
What's most striking
is the profound facial masking,

602
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:15,550
or deafferentation,
which we now know

603
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:18,760
should not to be confused
with apathy or catatonia.

604
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:27,730
Some things could reach him,
though.

605
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:33,730
The mention of his name,
notes of a particular piece of music.

606
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,480
Or the touch
of another human being.

607
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:42,200
But awakenings were rare
and transient,

608
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:44,070
lasting only a moment or two.

609
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:48,290
The rest of the time, he remained, as
you see him here, in a metaphorical,

610
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:53,380
if not physiological,
equivalent of sleep, or even death.

611
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:57,550
This was his condition when found by
me in a remote bay of this hospital,

612
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:01,840
and the quality of his life
for the last 30 years.

613
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:12,520
Now?
SAYER... Whenever you're ready.

614
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,860
My name is Leonard Lowe.

615
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:23,820
It has been explained to me that
I have been away for quite some time.

616
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,870
I'm back.

617
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,060
Okay, here we go.

618
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,650
Take her away.
Okay.

619
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:57,110
Thank you very much.
Sure.

620
01:05:57,270 --> 01:05:58,730
Thank you.

621
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:12,450
In the United States,
antiwar protesters organized

622
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:15,330
a national moratorium
to demonstrate opposition...

623
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:35,890
Dr. Sayer.

624
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:38,770
What is it?
It's a fucking miracle.

625
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:48,450
Where are my glasses?
On your face.

626
01:06:48,620 --> 01:06:49,660
Oh. Thank you.

627
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:04,840
I just feel so...

628
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:11,470
Beth, close the door.

629
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:14,640
I'm talking.

630
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:20,860
Light.

631
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:24,820
I'm loose.

632
01:07:24,990 --> 01:07:26,280
I'm scared.

633
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:27,990
Hello?

634
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:36,040
- Where is this?
- Don't worry.

635
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:40,880
I'm walking.

636
01:07:42,340 --> 01:07:44,000
Who are you?

637
01:07:44,420 --> 01:07:45,840
Get up, get up.

638
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,860
Thank you for coming.
Things are different.

639
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:07,690
- Miriam.
- Miriam.

640
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,360
Miriam.
Good morning.

641
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:11,370
- Look at that.
- Come on, Miriam.

642
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,240
- Miriam. Miriam.
- I'm so excited.

643
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:15,490
Come on, Miriam.

644
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:20,790
If you don't eat this food,
I'm gonna be in trouble.

645
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,040
Lucy.

646
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:26,300
I...

647
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,550
I had the strangest dream.

648
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,590
I have to take
your blood pressure.

649
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:34,890
I've been sitting for 25 years,
you missed your chance.

650
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:38,020
Are you okay?

651
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:41,060
I need some makeup.

652
01:08:42,270 --> 01:08:44,150
Okay. I think we can
take care of that.

653
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:48,570
And I need some dye for my hair.
Black.

654
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,280
Black? Rose, are you sure?

655
01:08:52,450 --> 01:08:54,570
Yes. It's always been black.

656
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,410
Dr. Sayer,
something about fruit trees.

657
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,870
Prune the fruit trees.

658
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:01,580
I will.

659
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,500
I want a steak, rare. Ah.

660
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:07,840
Mashed potatoes and gravy.
String beans.

661
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:10,920
I was aware of things,
but nothing meant anything to me.

662
01:09:11,090 --> 01:09:13,970
There was no connection to me.

663
01:09:14,140 --> 01:09:15,470
There was a war or two.

664
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:22,600
This morning,
I went to the bathroom all by myself.

665
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:26,980
Do it, do it, do it.
Heh, heh, heh.

666
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:30,530
I liked them better the other way.

667
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:34,780
Protesters marched from a meeting...

668
01:09:34,950 --> 01:09:36,030
Where did they go?

669
01:09:36,330 --> 01:09:39,750
Rolando, can you speak to me?

670
01:09:40,330 --> 01:09:42,500
It's Miss Costello.

671
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:47,040
Do you understand me?

672
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:53,510
Lucy...

673
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:55,390
what year is it?

674
01:09:57,140 --> 01:09:58,390
What year is it?

675
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:05,150
It's '26, silly.

676
01:10:06,110 --> 01:10:07,480
Miriam.

677
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,570
Miriam. Come on, Miriam, be a sport.

678
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:13,650
- It will only take a second.
- Don't touch.

679
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:14,990
- Miriam.
- Don't.

680
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,160
Oh, jeez, I'm getting tired of this.

681
01:10:17,450 --> 01:10:19,240
Come on, Miriam.

682
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,080
I'm convinced. I really am.

683
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:30,050
"Like crowds storming the Bastille,

684
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:33,920
the mighty Mets stormed
their locker room shortly after 9:00

685
01:10:34,090 --> 01:10:36,260
on their night to remember

686
01:10:36,430 --> 01:10:39,180
and touched off
one of the loudest, wildest,

687
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:43,600
wettest victory celebrations
in baseball history.

688
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:48,270
Released from bondage and ridicule
after seven destitute seasons,

689
01:10:48,440 --> 01:10:49,940
they raised the roof...

690
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:52,190
Lolly, Lolly, Lolly...

691
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,110
- Of Shea Stadium."

692
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:58,370
Lolly, Lolly, Lolly.

693
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:01,030
Sidney.

694
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:04,370
Hi, Sidney.

695
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,290
Hi.

696
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,560
Are we gonna go
to the same place?

697
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,560
- I don't know.
- Stay together.

698
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:27,140
Stop. Pay attention.
Stay together. Bring up the back.

699
01:11:27,310 --> 01:11:29,060
Everybody stay together,
come on.

700
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:31,900
Bye. Bye.
Here.

701
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,150
Bring Leonard.
Anthony, get Leonard. It's all right.

702
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:40,120
Wait. Leonard. Len.

703
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:43,240
Len, come on, come on, come on.

704
01:11:45,080 --> 01:11:47,750
- Please, stay with the group.
- Hurry up.

705
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,460
Come on now.
Stay together.

706
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:52,750
Hurry up.

707
01:11:56,090 --> 01:11:58,550
Okay, everybody get in. Back here.

708
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:02,220
- Okay, no pushing, no pushing.
- Just hop.

709
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:05,060
Hey, doctor, I wanted to ask you

710
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,100
how my father is.
The same.

711
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:10,310
Try and make room.
Ma, maybe you shouldn't go.

712
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,900
Oh, no. Of course I wanna go.
Don't be ridiculous.

713
01:12:14,070 --> 01:12:15,280
I'm gonna take the stairs.

714
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,740
It's crowded.
We'll go another time.

715
01:12:17,900 --> 01:12:21,320
You can't be there, Leonard,
or the door won't close. Thank you.

716
01:12:21,490 --> 01:12:22,990
Bert, stop jumping!

717
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:29,120
Sidney's going.
He's a patient, Mom.

718
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:33,340
He's not the same kind of patient.
But he's still a patient, you're not.

719
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,300
I'm your mother.

720
01:12:35,460 --> 01:12:37,920
Are there any
other mothers going?

721
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,630
Joseph.

722
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:40,800
Wait a minute.

723
01:12:40,970 --> 01:12:43,140
Now, what have you done
to your hair?

724
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:47,390
Yes, Bert. That's a tire.
I know it's a tire, I'm not an idiot.

725
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:49,520
There's your bus, Ma. There, go.

726
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:51,270
Have fun.

727
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:53,560
Don't you worry about it.

728
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:56,820
They treat me like an asshole.
We'll take care of that.

729
01:12:57,940 --> 01:12:58,990
See you guys.

730
01:12:59,990 --> 01:13:01,030
- There.
- All right?

731
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:03,820
- Bye-bye.
- Come on.

732
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:07,950
- Rolando. Rolando.
- You go in the back.

733
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,870
Now, move on back, please.
Right here.

734
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:15,290
You ready, Leonard?
I decided not to go. I'm gonna stay.

735
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:17,550
Why? What's wrong?
I'm okay, just...

736
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:19,010
Bye, Leonard.

737
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:20,720
Wave.

738
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:26,550
I'm...

739
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,310
Doctor, come on already.

740
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,770
I'm... All right. Leonard, are you sure?
Are you all right?

741
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:35,020
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'll see you later.
Have a good time.

742
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:36,230
- We...
- Come on.

743
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:38,440
Have a good time.
I'm coming.

744
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:41,780
Bert.
Bye, you guys. Have a good time.

745
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:43,410
Bye-bye
Bert, sit down.

746
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:47,620
- Fish sticks, please.
- Okay.

747
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:50,700
- Got those french fries.
- Okay, here you go.

748
01:13:51,910 --> 01:13:54,040
Hi. Um...

749
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,580
Meatloaf, please.

750
01:13:58,500 --> 01:14:01,210
Here you go.
Thank you.

751
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:04,220
Meatloaf.
Meatloaf too.

752
01:14:07,220 --> 01:14:08,600
Thank you.

753
01:14:09,060 --> 01:14:10,810
There you go. Okay?

754
01:14:12,390 --> 01:14:15,230
- Next.
- I'd like fish sticks.

755
01:14:15,400 --> 01:14:16,810
Are you following me?

756
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,990
Oh, I'm sorry, I was only kidding.

757
01:14:22,150 --> 01:14:24,740
I saw you upstairs just now.

758
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:28,370
Are you visiting someone?

759
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:29,990
Uh, no.

760
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:31,790
You work here.

761
01:14:33,250 --> 01:14:34,910
I live here.

762
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,290
You're a patient?

763
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:38,790
That's a dollar 80, baby.

764
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:41,460
You don't look like a patient.
Heh, heh.

765
01:14:42,970 --> 01:14:44,010
I don't?

766
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:54,480
Can I help you?

767
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:02,780
I've always loved Carnegiea,
haven't you?

768
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:04,650
Dr. Sayer.

769
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,990
What is it, Anthony?
Did you choose this place?

770
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,240
Why?

771
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:10,700
I always come here.

772
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:13,160
Why? I mean,
don't get me wrong, doc.

773
01:15:13,330 --> 01:15:14,450
This is a nice place.

774
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:17,790
But after the first hour,
it loses something.

775
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,790
Anthony seems to think
the group is bored.

776
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:22,630
They are.

777
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,510
I thought about taking them
to the opera house.

778
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:27,550
The opera?

779
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:32,350
The Museum of Natural History...
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.

780
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:35,480
Just a lot of dead stuffed things.
You know:

781
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,890
Oh, well, um...

782
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:40,980
Where else is there?

783
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:24,020
Is it legal again?
Yes, for some time.

784
01:16:24,190 --> 01:16:26,990
What can I get you?
Well...

785
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,110
A Rob Roy on the rocks.
A what?

786
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:32,570
Could you make that
a virgin Rob Roy?

787
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,870
I work the night shifts at this diner.

788
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:45,710
So sometimes before work,
I'll come see my father.

789
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,550
He used to go to all the games,

790
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,640
so I like to read him
the sports pages.

791
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:56,720
I don't even know if he knows
I visit him or not.

792
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,640
My mother doesn't think so.

793
01:17:00,690 --> 01:17:02,060
But you do.

794
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:08,230
Well, sometimes
I think I see something.

795
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:11,360
You know, I think I see a change.

796
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:15,660
And for a moment,
I see him like he was.

797
01:17:15,830 --> 01:17:17,740
You know, before the stroke.

798
01:17:20,120 --> 01:17:21,250
And then it's gone.

799
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:24,170
I don't even know if I saw anything.

800
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,460
Does that make any sense?

801
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:28,590
Yeah. Yes.

802
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:36,760
Okay, my troop, back to the ward.

803
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:39,720
Come on. Danny.

804
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:43,810
Bill, Deon. Come on.
Put your fork down. Let's go.

805
01:17:44,770 --> 01:17:46,940
So why are you here?

806
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:49,360
Come on, hurry up.

807
01:17:49,990 --> 01:17:51,780
I receive medication.

808
01:17:51,950 --> 01:17:53,400
For what?

809
01:17:54,280 --> 01:17:55,950
Let's go, come on.

810
01:17:57,410 --> 01:17:59,830
Without it,
I'm sort of like your father.

811
01:18:07,670 --> 01:18:09,340
But I'm okay now.

812
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:11,840
That's good. Heh, heh.

813
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:37,120
Please. No. No.

814
01:18:40,290 --> 01:18:41,580
I agree.

815
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:16,030
Thank you, Rose. Ay!

816
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,530
And I was so sure

817
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:21,910
he was over-easy with bacon,
wheat toast and black coffee,

818
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:24,750
I brought him his food
without taking his order.

819
01:19:24,910 --> 01:19:27,370
Know what he says?
"You forgot the tomato."

820
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:30,880
Did you bring it?
No. We were out of them.

821
01:19:31,050 --> 01:19:33,840
That's why I didn't get it
in the first place.

822
01:19:35,970 --> 01:19:38,720
Visiting hours
are from 3 to 6 every day.

823
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:41,220
Good afternoon.
Bainbridge Hospital.

824
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,930
Well...

825
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:46,890
it was really nice talking to you,
Leonard.

826
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:48,730
It was nice talking to you too.

827
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:53,900
Bye-bye.
Bye.

828
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:57,320
Paula?
Yeah?

829
01:19:58,110 --> 01:19:59,160
He knows.

830
01:20:00,660 --> 01:20:01,950
Your father.

831
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:03,830
He knows you visit him.

832
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:10,790
Bainbridge Hospital.

833
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:13,130
See you.

834
01:20:16,590 --> 01:20:18,550
Well, I could interrupt.

835
01:20:19,010 --> 01:20:20,930
One moment, please.

836
01:20:21,430 --> 01:20:23,680
Come on. I want you
to meet a wonderful man.

837
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:27,770
Can you believe this?
Doctor, these are my friends.

838
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,440
Hello.
He's my doctor.

839
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,310
Isn't he the cat's meow?

840
01:20:31,480 --> 01:20:33,150
I wanna show you the sunroom.

841
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:49,460
Miriam, I don't know how to tell you
this, so I'm just going to say it.

842
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,500
Your husband...

843
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:59,550
He was granted a divorce from you
in 1953.

844
01:21:02,590 --> 01:21:04,220
Thank God.

845
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:12,650
Whoa. Look at that.
Pontiac Firebird 400 engine.

846
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:15,980
Firebird.
Oh, now, that's a car.

847
01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:18,480
Morning, Lucy,
may I have your hand?

848
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:21,900
Take me away from this place.

849
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:29,290
Rum. Right here.

850
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:33,620
I guess I lose.
Well, I guess your luck is changing.

851
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:36,710
Very nice.

852
01:21:37,710 --> 01:21:40,840
How's it going?
How's it going?

853
01:21:41,220 --> 01:21:42,550
Yeah. How do you feel?

854
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,100
Well, my parents are dead,
my wife is in an institution,

855
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:54,190
my son has disappeared
out West somewhere.

856
01:21:56,020 --> 01:21:58,940
I feel old and I feel swindled.

857
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:00,690
That's how I feel.

858
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,370
I stopped by the hobby shop.

859
01:22:07,530 --> 01:22:09,950
I got more pencils.

860
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:13,920
And I got this.

861
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:17,420
A small T-square.

862
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:19,380
That's Good.
Oh, I can use that.

863
01:22:19,550 --> 01:22:21,960
Oh, good, okay. Good.

864
01:22:22,550 --> 01:22:25,050
Let's start a new room.
Hi, Leonard.

865
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,560
Hi.

866
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:35,140
That's really nice.

867
01:22:36,940 --> 01:22:38,610
I'll be right back.

868
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,400
Leonard.

869
01:22:46,740 --> 01:22:49,910
He never talked about girls before.

870
01:22:50,910 --> 01:22:54,000
He certainly never had
anything to do with them.

871
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:58,880
It's a bit ridiculous,
all this girl business.

872
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:01,590
Don't you think?
He's a grown man, Mrs. Lowe.

873
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,090
You know what he said to me?

874
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:06,180
I should take a vacation.

875
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:09,260
I should go away for a few days
and relax.

876
01:23:09,430 --> 01:23:12,310
I'm sure he meant you deserve
a vacation, which you do.

877
01:23:14,100 --> 01:23:16,770
I can't leave him alone in this place.

878
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:18,480
He'd die without me.

879
01:23:21,900 --> 01:23:23,780
Girls.

880
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:38,120
- Hello?
- Hello?

881
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:40,000
Dr. Sayer?

882
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,300
Dr. Sayer, I've gotta talk to you.

883
01:23:44,130 --> 01:23:46,630
Leonard?
Yes. I think it's important...

884
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,220
I think it's important
some things were said that...

885
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:52,100
Well, I just gotta talk to you.

886
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,510
What kind of things?

887
01:23:53,680 --> 01:23:56,140
Things that matter,
that have happened to me,

888
01:23:56,310 --> 01:23:58,980
things that I've come
to understand. Things.

889
01:23:59,150 --> 01:24:01,480
Where are you calling from,
Leonard?

890
01:24:01,650 --> 01:24:03,320
Your office.

891
01:24:03,730 --> 01:24:05,480
It's very late.

892
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:07,320
Is it?
Leonard.

893
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:11,320
You stay there, I'll be right over.
Good.

894
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:22,500
Leonard? Leonard?

895
01:24:23,170 --> 01:24:25,840
Dr. Sayer, sit down. Sit down.

896
01:24:26,010 --> 01:24:29,090
Why? What's wrong?

897
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:32,350
We've got to tell everybody.
We've got to remind them.

898
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:35,850
Remind them how good it is.
How good what is, Leonard?

899
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:42,270
Read the newspaper.
What does it say? All bad.

900
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:43,690
It's all bad.

901
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:47,780
People have forgotten what life's about.
Forgotten what it is to be alive.

902
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:49,360
They need to be reminded.

903
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:52,410
Reminded of what they have
and what they can lose.

904
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:57,370
And what I feel is the joy of life,
the gift of life, the freedom of life,

905
01:24:57,540 --> 01:24:58,910
the wonderment of life.

906
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:02,420
He kept saying that people
don't appreciate the simple things.

907
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:06,300
Work, play, friendship, family. It's...

908
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:10,170
And he was so excited,
he talked till 5:00 in the morning.

909
01:25:10,340 --> 01:25:13,140
I don't know whether
this is liberation, mania...

910
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:16,390
Or love?
Yes.

911
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,060
What he's saying is right though.
We don't really know how to live.

912
01:25:20,230 --> 01:25:22,520
But at 5 in the morning...

913
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:25,400
Waheedah. How are you?

914
01:25:25,570 --> 01:25:28,400
I'm fine.
Very good.

915
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:51,760
Mr. Lowe? Are you all right?
Yeah.

916
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:06,110
What is it that you want now?
The simplest thing.

917
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:08,270
And that is?

918
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:14,820
To have the choice to go for a walk
if I want to, like any normal person.

919
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:19,950
You are free to go for a walk.

920
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:23,290
I am? Alone?

921
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,590
What difference would that make?

922
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:29,800
Look, I'm not a criminal.

923
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:33,880
I've committed no crime,
I'm not a danger to myself or to others.

924
01:26:34,050 --> 01:26:38,140
And yet, I'm still not allowed to go
for a walk on my own by myself.

925
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:42,520
You didn't wake a thing,
you woke a person.

926
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,020
I am a person.

927
01:26:44,980 --> 01:26:47,940
Mr. Lowe, are you at all aware

928
01:26:48,110 --> 01:26:52,030
of the unconscious hostility you're
exhibiting toward us right now?

929
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:54,320
How can I be aware
if it's unconscious?

930
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:56,070
Nora, please.

931
01:26:58,990 --> 01:27:02,240
I'm curious. What would you
do if you went out?

932
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:09,750
I'd go for a walk, I'd look at things,
I'd talk to people.

933
01:27:10,170 --> 01:27:12,840
I'd decide if I wanna go
in this direction, or that direction,

934
01:27:13,010 --> 01:27:14,800
or straight ahead.

935
01:27:14,970 --> 01:27:17,680
I would do all the things
that you take for granted.

936
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:23,520
And that's it?
That's it.

937
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:30,650
All right, then, we'll certainly
take this into consideration,

938
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:33,030
and we'll let you know.

939
01:27:33,190 --> 01:27:35,530
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

940
01:27:43,330 --> 01:27:44,620
Dr. Sayer.

941
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:49,210
Are you all right?
Yeah. I was aware of that.

942
01:27:49,380 --> 01:27:51,920
It was nothing. I was nervous.
What did they say?

943
01:27:54,210 --> 01:27:57,380
They said there was
insufficient data at this time.

944
01:27:57,550 --> 01:28:02,100
That continued observation was
necessary for a complete diagnosis.

945
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:06,270
They said it's a different world out there
and you may not be prepared for it.

946
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:09,810
They couldn't be held responsible
for what might happen to you.

947
01:28:11,060 --> 01:28:12,400
They said no.

948
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:20,410
And what did you say?

949
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:24,410
They don't have to listen to me.
Did you agree with them?

950
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:27,580
Yes.

951
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,670
Leonard, I don't think
we're out of the woods yet.

952
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:36,590
I'm not sure that this is nothing.

953
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:38,420
It's an experimental drug.

954
01:28:38,590 --> 01:28:40,760
We need time
to evaluate things before...

955
01:28:41,640 --> 01:28:44,260
Bye.
Leonard.

956
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,100
Leonard.

957
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:49,100
Leonard, where are you going?

958
01:28:49,270 --> 01:28:50,850
For a walk.

959
01:28:51,730 --> 01:28:54,440
Leonard. Leonard.

960
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:01,360
This is Dr. Sayer.

961
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:03,950
Dorquez, please call the pharmacy.

962
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:06,450
Miss Dorquez,
call the pharmacy, please.

963
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:14,790
Where are you going?
I'm going outside.

964
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:17,300
No. Patients not allowed
beyond this point.

965
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,300
I'm going for a walk.
No, no. I'm sorry.

966
01:29:19,630 --> 01:29:22,380
Please, don't make it hard
on yourself.

967
01:29:24,350 --> 01:29:27,010
- I got him. I got him.
- Leonard, stop.

968
01:29:27,180 --> 01:29:30,140
- I just wanna go for a walk.
- He's not a mental patient.

969
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:33,810
This is unnecessary. Let him go.
Please, he's not violent.

970
01:29:33,980 --> 01:29:36,440
He's not violent.
He is not a mental patient.

971
01:29:36,610 --> 01:29:39,860
Will you let go? You will hurt him.
Will you let go of him?

972
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:43,570
Will you stop, please?
Let go of him.

973
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:48,120
I don't understand it.
He was never any trouble before.

974
01:29:48,290 --> 01:29:51,660
He was quiet and polite
and respectful.

975
01:29:51,830 --> 01:29:53,830
He never demanded anything.

976
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:55,670
He was never disobedient.

977
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:58,090
Because he was catatonic,
Mrs. Lowe.

978
01:29:59,970 --> 01:30:02,170
I'm speaking of when he was a boy.

979
01:30:04,050 --> 01:30:05,550
I'm sorry.

980
01:30:06,430 --> 01:30:08,600
I don't know who that is up there.

981
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:11,230
I don't think he knows.

982
01:30:11,850 --> 01:30:15,020
You've turned Leonard
into something he's not.

983
01:30:15,190 --> 01:30:19,690
It's not us that's defective, it's them.
We're not in crisis, they are.

984
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,440
- Yeah.
- They are.

985
01:30:21,610 --> 01:30:24,530
We've been through the worst
and survived. They haven't.

986
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:27,780
They fear it. They fear it.
Right.

987
01:30:27,950 --> 01:30:30,370
- Because they know.
- They know. They know.

988
01:30:30,540 --> 01:30:32,540
- They know.
- They know.

989
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:34,120
They know, they know

990
01:30:34,290 --> 01:30:37,880
because we remind them...

991
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:42,380
We remind them
that there's a problem...

992
01:30:42,550 --> 01:30:45,380
There's a problem
that they don't have an answer to.

993
01:30:45,930 --> 01:30:48,850
And they'll never be healers
until they realize this,

994
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:54,440
until they start to see the problem,
until they admit there is a problem.

995
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:57,810
And that the problem isn't us.
We're not the problem.

996
01:30:57,980 --> 01:31:00,150
It's them. They're the problem!

997
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,740
It's them!
They're the problem.

998
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:05,990
They're the problem.

999
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:10,120
They're the problem!
They're the problem! It's them!

1000
01:31:10,290 --> 01:31:12,490
They're the problem!

1001
01:31:15,370 --> 01:31:18,330
He's lived 30 years
without the ability to release anger.

1002
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:19,670
As have the others.

1003
01:31:19,840 --> 01:31:22,590
I think his behavior
is more natural than the others.

1004
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:26,880
Oh, really? His tics, his paranoia,
these are signs of normal behavior?

1005
01:31:27,050 --> 01:31:29,470
Yeah, because he's in that place.
Oh, is that it?

1006
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:32,350
Yes, we wake him up
and then lock him up in a cage.

1007
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,980
That's not paranoia, that's a fact.

1008
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:38,480
The fact is, I've got 20 psychotics
up there refusing to eat.

1009
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:41,440
Now, they have no idea
why they're refusing to eat.

1010
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:45,280
How long should I let that go on?
He knows why. He wants out.

1011
01:31:45,450 --> 01:31:48,910
Dr. Sayer, Mr. Lowe is not
the messiah of Ward 5.

1012
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:51,160
He's a man in trouble.

1013
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:54,330
He wasn't resurrected,
he was administered a drug by you.

1014
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:57,460
A drug that's fallen short
of its miraculous reputation.

1015
01:31:57,620 --> 01:31:59,750
The others are fine.
They show no signs...

1016
01:31:59,920 --> 01:32:01,630
He's been on it longer, doctor.

1017
01:32:05,970 --> 01:32:09,090
Now, I sympathize with him,
I've tried to accommodate him.

1018
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:12,970
But I will not let him endanger
the health of the rest of the patients.

1019
01:32:18,690 --> 01:32:20,980
It will help if you wait for me
out there.

1020
01:32:21,150 --> 01:32:22,560
Thank you.

1021
01:32:24,110 --> 01:32:25,320
Excuse me.

1022
01:32:25,780 --> 01:32:27,820
- Excuse me.
- We can't allow it.

1023
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,070
He's all right.

1024
01:32:33,660 --> 01:32:35,290
He's all right.

1025
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:47,970
How are you today?

1026
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:50,930
I'm all right. How are you?

1027
01:32:52,720 --> 01:32:54,100
Never better.

1028
01:32:56,720 --> 01:32:58,680
What's the purpose
of these gentlemen?

1029
01:32:58,850 --> 01:33:02,190
Oh, these gentlemen protect me.

1030
01:33:02,980 --> 01:33:06,190
I wish I didn't need them.
Someone's trying to hurt you?

1031
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,190
Who?
Who? Heh, heh.

1032
01:33:09,530 --> 01:33:11,860
That's the thing, isn't it? Who?

1033
01:33:12,370 --> 01:33:15,620
One never knows.
Someone I least expect, I expect.

1034
01:33:16,370 --> 01:33:18,200
Look at history.

1035
01:33:19,210 --> 01:33:23,210
Leonard, every patient on this ward
thinks there's a plot against him.

1036
01:33:23,540 --> 01:33:25,380
They're mistaken, they're crazy.

1037
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:34,260
You've gotten worse.

1038
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:40,060
The drug's not working.

1039
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:44,770
All these things you're experiencing
are side effects.

1040
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:46,480
They're making you behave this way.

1041
01:33:46,650 --> 01:33:49,740
I appreciate you coming to see me,
but I have things to do.

1042
01:33:49,900 --> 01:33:52,450
Leonard, Leonard,
please, look at yourself.

1043
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:55,910
No, look at yourself.
I have a sickness.

1044
01:33:56,530 --> 01:34:00,080
Sickness took me out of the world,
and I fought to come back.

1045
01:34:00,250 --> 01:34:05,830
I fought for 30 years, 30 years,
and I'm still fighting.

1046
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:07,920
But you have no excuse.
Me?

1047
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:10,630
Nothing to do with me.
You have no excuse.

1048
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,430
You're just a scared and lonely man
with nothing.

1049
01:34:13,590 --> 01:34:16,470
No life, nothing.
You're the one that's asleep.

1050
01:34:17,220 --> 01:34:21,850
Your medicine could be taken away.
They can do that.

1051
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,900
You could wake up in the morning
and it won't be there.

1052
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:32,490
Leonard.

1053
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,950
Get away from me!

1054
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:54,340
I'm all right. Thank you.

1055
01:34:54,630 --> 01:34:57,390
I just fell. I'm fine.

1056
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:02,090
Sayer.

1057
01:37:20,150 --> 01:37:21,740
Help me.

1058
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,720
Can you walk?

1059
01:37:42,180 --> 01:37:44,800
I won't let them take
the medicine away, Leonard.

1060
01:37:44,970 --> 01:37:46,970
We'll work together with it.

1061
01:37:51,140 --> 01:37:53,940
All we're saying is you're taking
an unnecessary risk.

1062
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:57,650
He's had a reaction to the drug.
He has acquired some tics.

1063
01:37:57,820 --> 01:38:00,690
But he's not as concerned
with his appearance

1064
01:38:00,860 --> 01:38:03,820
as the affect it may have
upon the other patients.

1065
01:38:04,490 --> 01:38:06,320
We'll be working with his dosage.

1066
01:38:06,490 --> 01:38:08,660
He's aware,
and he's prepared for any effects.

1067
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:11,000
But he wants the others
to be prepared as well.

1068
01:38:12,210 --> 01:38:15,250
- You've gotta help me with this.
- Yes, doctor. Okay.

1069
01:38:29,220 --> 01:38:30,560
Hey, Len.

1070
01:38:31,270 --> 01:38:32,520
Welcome back.
Thanks.

1071
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:37,770
Hi, Leonard.
How you doing?

1072
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:39,650
How you feeling?
You all right?

1073
01:38:39,820 --> 01:38:43,030
Gee, it's swell to see you.
What's up, Bert?

1074
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:48,450
It got so quiet around here.
Ha, ha. Because we're waiting for you.

1075
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:00,300
That's wonderful, Miriam.

1076
01:39:03,630 --> 01:39:06,720
You're looking good, Len.
You're looking better every day.

1077
01:39:06,890 --> 01:39:08,180
Yeah?

1078
01:39:13,890 --> 01:39:16,190
What if he's just had enough of it?

1079
01:39:16,350 --> 01:39:19,560
What if it's just a matter of time
for all of us?

1080
01:39:23,490 --> 01:39:25,110
There's no reason to think

1081
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:27,950
what's happening to Leonard
will happen to you.

1082
01:39:28,450 --> 01:39:29,450
Why not?

1083
01:39:30,740 --> 01:39:33,250
Well, you're all individuals.

1084
01:39:33,410 --> 01:39:36,290
And you're well.

1085
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:39,130
Aren't you?
Yes.

1086
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:57,190
That was lovely, Lucy.

1087
01:39:57,850 --> 01:40:02,110
I learned that song
a long, long time ago.

1088
01:40:05,650 --> 01:40:07,450
I know what year it is.

1089
01:40:09,950 --> 01:40:13,950
I just can't imagine
being older than 22.

1090
01:40:14,290 --> 01:40:16,120
I've no experience at it.

1091
01:40:18,120 --> 01:40:21,130
I know it's not 1926.

1092
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:25,510
I just need it to be.

1093
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,400
How are you, Leonard?

1094
01:40:43,820 --> 01:40:45,030
Never better.

1095
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:53,490
How are the others?
Are they talking about me?

1096
01:40:53,700 --> 01:40:55,410
They're scared.

1097
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,660
Well, they should be.

1098
01:41:02,340 --> 01:41:04,590
Can you stop this?

1099
01:41:04,840 --> 01:41:06,670
I'm not sure, but I'm trying.

1100
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:10,130
Don't give up on me.
I won't.

1101
01:41:23,150 --> 01:41:25,690
Four twenty-five, yes.
Four twenty-five. Okay.

1102
01:41:25,860 --> 01:41:29,190
Here we go, 425.

1103
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:35,120
I got a postcard from my son.

1104
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,540
I'm all right,
and then everything stops.

1105
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:40,040
Look at this,
I got a postcard from my son.

1106
01:41:40,210 --> 01:41:42,710
No warning,
it's like a light switch going off.

1107
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:44,210
It happens that fast.

1108
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,670
Something has to happen
to bring me back.

1109
01:41:46,840 --> 01:41:49,800
A sound or a touch.

1110
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:52,800
And then I can move again,
I'm okay again.

1111
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:54,510
Thanks.

1112
01:41:58,520 --> 01:42:01,430
It's not that it feels bad,
it's just that it's nothing.

1113
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,270
I feel nothing, like I'm dead.

1114
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:11,400
Nothing.

1115
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:14,740
Gets to be like I'm not
a person anymore.

1116
01:42:14,910 --> 01:42:17,410
Just a collection of tics.

1117
01:42:17,950 --> 01:42:20,450
Not that I mind them necessarily.

1118
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:23,290
Sometimes they make life
kind of interesting.

1119
01:42:23,460 --> 01:42:26,170
Though I'm not sure who's in control,
me or them.

1120
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:29,590
What I do mind is knowing
that they shouldn't be there.

1121
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:32,840
Back to 5.

1122
01:42:33,010 --> 01:42:35,090
Okay. Five. Five.

1123
01:42:42,350 --> 01:42:46,480
Just a little more. Just...
Okay, all right.

1124
01:42:46,900 --> 01:42:50,150
It feels good when I'm working.
I feel good here.

1125
01:42:51,690 --> 01:42:54,490
Book list is coming along well.
I'd love to see it.

1126
01:42:54,660 --> 01:42:56,660
It's here somewhere.

1127
01:43:02,290 --> 01:43:04,580
That's all right,
some other time.

1128
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:10,340
Leonard. Leonard.
Ugh!

1129
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,130
What's happening?
You're having an oculogyric crisis.

1130
01:43:14,300 --> 01:43:15,800
Get the camera.

1131
01:43:16,220 --> 01:43:18,510
Get the camera.
Get the camera.

1132
01:43:18,680 --> 01:43:20,560
Oh, God.

1133
01:43:29,230 --> 01:43:31,480
I can't do this.
I'm turning the camera off.

1134
01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:33,150
No, no. Watch, watch, watch.

1135
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:35,200
Watch, watch, watch.

1136
01:43:36,860 --> 01:43:41,660
Learn, learn, learn.

1137
01:43:41,830 --> 01:43:44,370
Learn for me. Learn.

1138
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:46,830
Let's see this

1139
01:43:47,750 --> 01:43:51,960
- Six twenty-five.
- All right, 625.

1140
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:55,260
Six seventy-five, if... Just...
Six seventy-five.

1141
01:43:55,420 --> 01:43:56,510
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1142
01:44:13,230 --> 01:44:15,030
I can't read anymore.

1143
01:44:15,190 --> 01:44:17,990
I can't keep my eyes in one place.

1144
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:20,700
I keep going back
to the beginning, beginning,

1145
01:44:20,870 --> 01:44:23,080
beginning, beginning,
beginning...

1146
01:44:25,450 --> 01:44:28,210
I've let everybody down. I have.
No.

1147
01:44:28,370 --> 01:44:30,380
I've let you down.
No, you have not.

1148
01:44:30,540 --> 01:44:34,550
I have, I have. I'm grotesque.
You are not. It's not true.

1149
01:44:34,710 --> 01:44:37,510
I won't listen to you talk like this.
I'm grotesque. Look at me.

1150
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:39,930
Look, and tell me I am not.
Tell me I'm not.

1151
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:42,300
You're not.
Well, this isn't me.

1152
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:44,890
This is... This isn't me.

1153
01:44:59,910 --> 01:45:04,080
When my son was born healthy,
I never asked why.

1154
01:45:05,240 --> 01:45:06,700
Why was I so lucky?

1155
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:10,500
What did I do to deserve
this perfect child?

1156
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:12,920
This perfect life?

1157
01:45:13,210 --> 01:45:14,590
But when he got sick,

1158
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:18,380
you can bet I asked why,
I demanded to know why.

1159
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:20,970
Why was this happening?

1160
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:28,140
There was nothing I could do about it.
No one I could go to and say:

1161
01:45:28,310 --> 01:45:34,770
"Stop this. Please, stop this.
Can't you see my son is in pain?"

1162
01:45:37,110 --> 01:45:40,610
My son is in pain. Please, stop this.

1163
01:45:41,910 --> 01:45:44,780
He's fighting, Mrs. Lowe.
He's losing.

1164
01:46:10,940 --> 01:46:12,480
Here you go.

1165
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:15,020
Uh, I worked,

1166
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:18,440
had friends over, went dancing.

1167
01:46:18,610 --> 01:46:20,530
That's about it, not much.

1168
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:22,490
That's great, you know.

1169
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:27,030
I've never done any of those things.
You will.

1170
01:46:30,450 --> 01:46:33,330
They'll never let me out
of this place.

1171
01:46:36,250 --> 01:46:38,170
And they shouldn't.

1172
01:46:40,050 --> 01:46:45,510
I am still not well, as you can see.

1173
01:46:52,020 --> 01:46:54,690
You know,
I feel well when I see you.

1174
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:01,320
And...

1175
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:20,750
I won't see you anymore.

1176
01:47:33,140 --> 01:47:36,940
I just wanted to say goodbye.

1177
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:02,670
Look.

1178
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,620
Isn't that sweet?

1179
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,850
Now?
SAYER... Whenever you're ready.

1180
01:51:00,770 --> 01:51:02,600
My name is Leonard Lowe.

1181
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:06,560
It has been explained to me
that I have been away

1182
01:51:06,730 --> 01:51:08,360
for quite some time.

1183
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:11,940
I'm back.

1184
01:51:13,650 --> 01:51:15,450
What's it like to be back?

1185
01:51:16,030 --> 01:51:19,740
I thought it was a dream at first.

1186
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:22,790
What made you realize
it wasn't a dream?

1187
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:27,460
When I spoke
and you understood me.

1188
01:51:49,570 --> 01:51:51,860
You told him I was a kind man.

1189
01:51:55,030 --> 01:51:56,990
How kind is it to give life

1190
01:51:57,530 --> 01:51:59,990
only to take it away again?

1191
01:52:01,700 --> 01:52:04,580
It's given and taken away
from all of us.

1192
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:09,750
Why doesn't that comfort me?

1193
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,510
Because you are a kind man.

1194
01:52:27,190 --> 01:52:29,400
Because he's your friend.

1195
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:08,180
The summer was extraordinary.

1196
01:53:08,350 --> 01:53:11,560
It was a season of rebirth
and innocence.

1197
01:53:11,730 --> 01:53:13,400
A miracle

1198
01:53:13,570 --> 01:53:17,900
for 15 patients and for us,
their caretakers.

1199
01:53:18,570 --> 01:53:22,910
But now we have to adjust
to the realities of miracles.

1200
01:53:24,240 --> 01:53:28,080
We can hide behind the veil of
science and say the drug failed.

1201
01:53:28,410 --> 01:53:31,250
Or that the illness itself
had returned.

1202
01:53:31,420 --> 01:53:36,920
Or that the patients were unable to cope
with losing decades of their lives.

1203
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:40,260
But the reality is
we don't know what went wrong

1204
01:53:40,430 --> 01:53:42,970
any more than we know
what went right.

1205
01:53:44,180 --> 01:53:49,600
What we do know is,
as the chemical window closed,

1206
01:53:51,600 --> 01:53:54,230
another awakening took place.

1207
01:53:58,110 --> 01:54:03,030
That the human spirit
is more powerful than any drug.

1208
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:07,790
And that is what needs
to be nourished.

1209
01:54:09,450 --> 01:54:16,000
With work, play, friendship, family.

1210
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:20,800
These are the things that matter.

1211
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:25,930
This is what we'd forgotten.

1212
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:32,940
The simplest things.

1213
01:54:41,240 --> 01:54:44,240
Well, ahem, good night.

1214
01:54:44,410 --> 01:54:45,950
Good night.

1215
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:41,550
Eleanor!
Yes?

1216
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:44,050
Um...

1217
01:55:53,810 --> 01:55:55,810
Eleanor? Um...

1218
01:55:55,980 --> 01:55:57,650
What's wrong?

1219
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:02,070
I was wondering,
what are you doing tonight?

1220
01:56:03,190 --> 01:56:05,190
If you have other plans, I...

1221
01:56:05,360 --> 01:56:07,610
No, I was...
Because I was wondering...

1222
01:56:07,780 --> 01:56:10,910
You have no plans?
No, I have no, uh...

1223
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:13,080
Because I was wondering if you...

1224
01:56:13,250 --> 01:56:17,040
We... Well, you and I could, um...

1225
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:22,750
If we could, um,
go for a cup of coffee.

1226
01:56:24,420 --> 01:56:25,920
Yes.

1227
01:56:26,470 --> 01:56:28,220
I'd love to.

1228
01:56:35,730 --> 01:56:37,430
My car is over here.

1229
01:56:37,600 --> 01:56:40,270
What do you say we just walk?

1230
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:42,020
Okay.

1231
01:57:20,650 --> 01:57:22,400
Let's begin.

2
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,900
- Po Lazarus!
- Po Lazarus.

4
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,800
# Well, the high sheriff, 
he told the deputy #

5
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:09,500
# Won't you go out 
and bring me Lazarus? #

6
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:15,800
# Well, the high sheriff, 
he told the deputy #

7
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:23,800
# Won't you go out 
and bring me Lazarus? #

6
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,496
Get a break, boss?

7
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,800
No break.

8
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,100
# Oh, bring him dead or alive #

9
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,500
# O Lord #

10
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,600
# Bring him dead or alive #

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,300
# Well, the deputy, 
he told the high sheriff #

12
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,200
# Well, I ain't gonna mess 
with Lazarus #

13
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,000
# Well, the deputy, 
he told the high sheriff #

14
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,480
# Said I ain't gonna mess 
with Lazarus #

9
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,703
Pick up that hammer there, boy.

10
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,080
Yes, sir, boss.

16
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,900
# Well, he's a dangerous man #

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
# O Lord, he's a dangerous man #

12
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,594

Any of you boys smithies?

17
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,197
Or if not smithies per se,

18
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,408
were you otherwise trained
in the metallurgic arts

19
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,786
before straitened circumstances forced
you into a life of aimless wanderin'?

21
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,508
Jesus! Can't I count on you people?

22
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,469
Sorry, Everett.

23
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,888
Well, all right.

24
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,766
If we take off through that bayou--

25
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,017
Wait a minute.

26
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,811
Who elected you leader of this outfit?

27
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,313
Well, Pete, I figured it should be the one

28
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,648
with the capacity for abstract thought.

29
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:00,650
But if that ain't the consensus view,

30
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,319
then hell, let's put it to a vote.

31
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,403
Suits me!

32
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:05,030
I'm votin' for yours truly.

33
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,449
Well, I'm votin' for yours truly, too.

34
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,957
Okay. I'm with you fellas.

35
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,901
Mind if we join you, old-timer?

36
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,237
Join me, m' son.

37
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,655
Join me.

38
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,828
You work for the railroad, grandpa?

39
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,247
I work for no man.

40
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,706
Got a name, do you?

41
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:59,543
I have no name.

42
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,129
Well, that right there may be the reason

43
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,506
you've had difficulty finding
gainful employment.

44
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:07,217
You see, in the mart
of competitive commerce--

45
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,219
You seek a great fortune,

46
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,513
you three who are now in chains.

47
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,850
You will find a fortune,

48
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,437
though it will not be the fortune you seek.

49
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,897
But first...

50
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:23,191
First you must travel

51
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,987
a long and difficult road.

52
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:31,950
A road fraught with peril.

53
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,245
You shall see thangs

54
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,664
wonderful to tell.

55
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,418
You shall see a cow

56
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:46,173
on the roof of a cotton house.

57
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,719
And, oh, so many startlements.

58
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,055
I cannot tell you how long this road shall be,

59
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,517
but fear not the obstacles in your path,

60
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,102
for fate has

61
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,439
vouchsafed your reward.

62
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,484
Though the road may wind,

63
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,278
yea, your hearts grow weary,

64
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,281
still shall ye follow them,

65
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,826
even unto your salvation.

66
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,052
No, the treasure's still there, boys,
believe me.

67
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,638
But how'd he know about the treasure?

68
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,389
I don't know, Delmar.

69
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,808
The blind are reputed
to possess sensitivities

70
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,602
compensating for their lack of sight,

71
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,939
even to the point of developing
paranormal psychic powers.

73
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,609
Now, clearly, seeing in the future
would fall neatly into that category.

75
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,402
It's not so surprising then,

76
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,905
that an organism deprived
of its earthly vision--

77
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,073
He said we wouldn't get it.

78
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,492
He said we wouldn't get
the treasure we seek,

79
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,993
on account of our obstacles.

80
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:59,996
What the hell does he know?
He's an ignorant old man.

82
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,958
Jesus, Pete. I told you I buried it myself.

83
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,377
If your cousin still has this here horse farm

84
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,337
and a forge and some shoein' impedimenta

85
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,672
to restore liberty of movement--

86
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,133
Hold it right there!

87
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,221
You men from the bank?

88
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,681
You Wash's boy?

89
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:21,810
Yes, sir. Daddy told me I'm to
shoot who's ever from the bank.

91
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,437
Well, we ain't from the bank, young feller.

92
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:28,191
Yes, sir. I'm also supposed
to shoot folks servin' papers.

94
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:29,484
We ain't got no papers, neither.

95
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,778
I nicked the census man.

96
00:09:31,946 --> 00:09:34,489
Now, there's a good boy.

97
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,825
Is your daddy about?

98
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,047
Hello, Pete.

99
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,383
Who are your friends?

100
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,052
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
Mr. Hogwallop.

102
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,388
My name's Ulysses Everett McGill and...

103
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,140
And I'm Delmar O'Donnel.

104
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,685
How you been, Wash?

105
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,938
Been what, 12, 13 years?

106
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,985
Yeah.

107
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:15,447
I expect you want them chains knocked off.

108
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,867
They foreclosed on Cousin Vester.

109
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,953
He hanged hisself a year come May.

110
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,788
And Uncle Ratliff?

111
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,000
The anthrax took most of his cows.

112
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,418
The rest don't milk.

113
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,463
He lost a boy to mumps.

114
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,882
Where's Cora, Cousin Wash?

115
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,430
Couldn't say.

116
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:47,270
Mrs. Hogwallop up and R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

117
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,900
She must have been lookin' for answers.

118
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,193
Possibly.

119
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,445
Good riddance, as far as I'm concerned.

120
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,490
I do miss her cooking, though.

121
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,949
This stew's awful good.

122
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,284
You think so?

123
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,497
I slaughtered this horse last Tuesday.

124
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,083
I'm afraid she's startin' to turn.

125
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,487
<i>Well, that winds up tonight's<i>

126
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:40,240
<i>Pass the Biscuits
Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour.</i>

127
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:44,911
<i>This is Pappy O'Daniel hopin' you folks
been enjoyin' that good old-timey music.</i>

129
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,080
<i>And remember,</i>

130
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,792
<i>when you're fixin' to fry up some
flapjacks or bake a mess of biscuits,</i>

132
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,836
<i>use cool, clear water</i>

133
00:11:53,003 --> 00:11:56,214
<i>and good, pure Pappy O'Daniel flour.</i>

134
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,509
Well, guess I'll be turnin' in.

135
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,721
Say, Cousin Wash...

136
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,390
I suppose it'd be the acme of foolishness

137
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,308
to inquire if you had a hair net.

138
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,520
We got a bunch in yon bureau.

139
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,897
Mrs. Hogwallop's, as a matter of fact.

140
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:15,608
Help yourself.

141
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,694
I won't be needing 'em.

142
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,166
All right, boys!

143
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,126
How's my hair?

144
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,837
It's the authorities!

145
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,131
We got you surrounded.

146
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,883
Damn, we're in a tight spot.

147
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,802
Just come on out and grabbin' air!

148
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,180
And don't try nothin' fancy.

149
00:12:45,347 --> 00:12:48,558
Your situation is pretty nigh hopeless.

150
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,102
Damn! We're in a tight spot!

151
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,520
What in the Sam Hill?

152
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,397
Pete's cousin turned us in for the bounty.

153
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,899
What the hell are you saying?

154
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,109
Wash is kin!

155
00:12:58,277 --> 00:12:59,277
Sorry, Pete!

156
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:03,072
I know we're kin,
but they got this depression on.

157
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,074
I got to do for me and mine.

158
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,118
I'm gonna kill you...

159
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,621
Judas Iscariot Hogwallop!

160
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:12,749
You miserable, horse-eatin' son of a--

161
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,127
Damn! We're in a tight spot!

162
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,921
Damn his eyes!

163
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:21,049
Pa always said,
"Never trust a Hogwallop."

164
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,761
Come and get us, coppers!

165
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,431
You boys is leavin' us no choice,

166
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,183
but to smoke you out.

167
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,810
Damn! We're in a tight spot.

168
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,102
Light her up!

169
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,437
Hold up, boys!

170
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,648
Ain't you ever heard of negotiatin'?

171
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:37,941
Bet we could talk this thing out.

172
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,317
I hate fire!

173
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,778
You lousy, low-down, yellow-bellied goat!

174
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,280
Pete, we got to speak with one voice here.

175
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,782
Careful with that fire, now, boys!

176
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,620
Light the loft, son.

178
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,164
I hate fire!

179
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,585
Gapped-toothed, carpetbaggin',
motherless spawn of hell!

180
00:13:57,753 --> 00:14:00,630
Step back, damn it. Look out.

181
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,507
Holy St. Christopher!

182
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,133
Get away from that vehicle, chaps!

183
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:05,260
She's liquid fire!

184
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:11,057
Take cover, boys! That ain't popcorn!

185
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,607
Let's get the hell out of here!

186
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,026
Scatter, boys!

187
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:26,114
Goddamn it!

188
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,161
Get in, boys!

189
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,831
I'm gonna R-U-N-N-O-F-T!

190
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,835
Come on, boys, come on! Come on!

191
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,753
What are you doing here?

192
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,256
You ought to be in bed, clump snatcher.

193
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,508
You ain't the boss of me!

194
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,686
You candy-butted, car-thievin' so-and-so's!

195
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:59,022
I curse your name!

196
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,941
Go back home and mind your pa!

197
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,322
What's the damn problem?

198
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,492
I can get the part from Bristol.

199
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,494
It'll take 2 weeks. Here's your pomade.

200
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,871
Two weeks?

201
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,539
That don't do me no good.

202
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,292
Nearest Ford auto man's Bristol.

203
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,711
Hold on, now. I don't want this pomade.

204
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:22,879
I want Dapper Dan.

205
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,007
I don't carry Dapper Dan. I carry Fop.

206
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,384
Well, I don't want Fop, goddamn it!

207
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,178
I'm a Dapper Dan man!

208
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,262
Watch your language, young fella.

209
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,555
This is a public market.

210
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,849
Now, if you want Dapper Dan,
I can order it for you.

211
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,185
Have it in a couple of weeks.

212
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,562
Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity.

213
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,939
2 weeks from everywhere.

214
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,107
Forget it.

215
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,860
Just a dozen hair nets.

216
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,073
Well, didn't look like a one-horse town,

217
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,659
but try finding a decent hair jelly.

218
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:53,743
Gopher, Everett?

219
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,412
And no transmission belt
for 2 weeks neither.

220
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:00,291
Huh? They dam that river on the 21st.

221
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:01,542
Today is the 17th.

222
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,585
Don't I know it.

223
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,421
We got but 4 days to get to that treasure.

224
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,925
After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake.

225
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,593
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.

226
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,719
That's right.

227
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:12,887
Gopher, Everett?

228
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,932
But the old tactician has got a plan.

229
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,100
For the transportation, that is.

230
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,560
I don't know how I'm gonna
keep my coiffure in order.

231
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:22,897
How's this a plan?
How we gonna get a car?

232
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:27,610
Sell that. I figure you can only have
painful association for Wash.

234
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,365
"To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop."

235
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,075
"From his lovin' Cora."

236
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:38,913
"Amor Fidel... is."

237
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,289
It was in his bureau.

238
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:41,916
I reckon it'll fetch us enough cash

239
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,209
for a good used auto voiture

240
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,253
and a little leftover besides.

241
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,964
You got some light fingers, Everett.

242
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,007
Gopher?

243
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:51,968
You miserable little snake.

244
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,970
You stole from my kin!

245
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,764
Who was fixin' to betray us.

246
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,017
You didn't know that at the time.

247
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,269
So I borrowed it till I did know.

248
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,479
That don't make no sense!

249
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,733
Pete, it's a fool who looks for logic
in the chambers of the human heart.

251
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,610
What the hell is that singing?

252
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:17,285
Appears to be some kind of a...
congregation.

253
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,413
Care for some gopher?

254
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,377
No, thank you, Delmar.

255
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,047
A third of a gopher would
only arouse my appetite

256
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,591
without beddin' her back down.

257
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,177
Oh, you can have the whole thing.

258
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,262
Me and Pete already had one.

259
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:44,220
We ran across a whole gopher village.

266
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,700
# O brothers, let's go down #

267
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,500
# Let's go down, come on down #

268
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,000
# Come on, brothers, let's go down #

269
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,300
# Down in the river to pray #

270
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:09,000
# As I went down in the river to pray #

271
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,200
# Studyin' about that good old way #

272
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,000
# And who shall wear the starry crown #

273
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,000
# Good Lord, show me the way #

274
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,000
# O fathers, let's go down #

275
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,700
# Let's go down, come on down #

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,500
# O fathers, let's go down #

277
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,000
# Down in the river to pray #

278
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,000
# As I went down in the river to pray #

279
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,700
# Studyin' about that good old way #

280
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,900
# And who shall wear the robe and crown #

281
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,700
# Good lord, show me the way #

282
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,500
# O mothers, let's go down #

283
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,500
# Come on down,
don't you wanna go down? #

284
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,700
# Come on, mothers, let's go down #

260
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,435
Well, I guess hard times flush the chumps.

261
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,563
Everybody's lookin' for answers.

262
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,110
Where the hell's he going?

263
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:18,322
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

290
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,000
# O sinners, let's go down #

264
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,750
Well, I'll be a son of a bitch.

265
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,961
Delmar's been saved.

266
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,173
Well, that's it, boys. I been redeemed.

267
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:39,844
The preacher done washed away
all my sins and transgressions.

269
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,513
It's the straight and narrow from here on out.

270
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,474
And heaven everlasting's my reward.

271
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:46,976
Delmar, what are you talkin' about?

272
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,519
We got bigger fish to fry.

273
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:52,148
The preacher said
all my sins is washed away,

274
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,443
including that Piggly Wiggly
I knocked over in Yazoo.

275
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,653
I thought you said you was
innocent of those charges.

276
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:00,156
Well, I was lyin'.

277
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:04,160
And the preacher said that
that sin's been washed away, too.

279
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:07,788
Neither God, nor man's
got nothin' on me now.

280
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,292
Come on in, boys. The water is fine.

281
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,301
Come on, boy. There, boy.

282
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,677
Good doggy.

283
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,015
All right, boys, we got the scent.

284
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,021
The preacher said it absolved us.

285
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,398
For him, not for the law.

286
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,524
I'm surprised at you, Pete.

287
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,401
I gave you credit for more brains
than Delmar.

288
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,987
But there was witnesses seen us redeemed.

289
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,697
That's not the issue, Delmar.

290
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:43,366
Even if it did put you square with the Lord,

291
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,201
the state of Mississippi's
a little more hard-nosed.

292
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,286
You should have joined us, Everett.

293
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,871
It couldn't have hurt none.

294
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,541
Hell, at least it would have washed away
the stink of that pomade.

296
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,378
Joining you two ignorant fools
in a ridiculous superstition...

298
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:56,420
Thank you, anyway.

299
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,297
And I like the smell of my hair treatment.

300
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,341
The pleasin' odor's half the point.

301
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,136
Baptism!

302
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,639
You two are just dumber
than a bag of hammers.

303
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,683
Well, I guess you're just my cross to bear.

304
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,059
Pull over, Everett.

305
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,228
Let's give that colored boy a lift.

306
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,238
You folks going past Tishomingo?

307
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:23,823
Sure, hop in.

308
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,126
How you doin', son? Name's Everett.

309
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,379
These two soggy sons of bitches
are Pete and Delmar.

311
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,381
Keep your fingers away from Pete's mouth.

312
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,924
He ain't had nothing to eat for 13 years

313
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,927
except prison food, gopher,
and a little greasy horse.

314
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,762
Thanks for the lift, sir.

315
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,140
My name's Tommy. Tommy Johnson.

316
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,267
How you doin', Tommy?

317
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:54,603
Say, I haven't seen a house out here for miles.

318
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,315
What are you doin' out
in the middle of nowhere?

319
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,276
Well, I had to be at that there
crossroads last midnight.

320
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,819
Sell my soul to the devil.

321
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:03,487
Well, ain't it a small world?

322
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,114
Spiritually speakin'.

323
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,783
Pete and Delmar just
been baptized and saved.

324
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:09,994
I guess I'm the only one
that remains unaffiliated.

325
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,954
This ain't no laughin' matter, Everett.

326
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,956
What'd the devil give you
for your soul, Tommy?

327
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:17,335
Well, he taught me to play
this here guitar real good.

328
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,711
Oh, son!

329
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,256
For that you traded your everlasting soul?

330
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:23,841
Well, I wasn't usin' it.

331
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:28,262
I've always wondered,
what's the devil look like?

332
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:32,016
Well, of course, there are all manner
of lesser imps and demons, Pete,

334
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,476
but the great Satan hisself

335
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,770
is red and scaly with a bifurcated tail

336
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,979
and he carries a hay fork.

337
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:39,648
Oh, no. No, sir.

338
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:43,319
He's white. As white as you folks.

339
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,447
With empty eyes and a big, hollow voice.

340
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,325
He loved to travel around
with a mean old hound.

341
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,326
That's right.

342
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,536
And he told you to go to Tishomingo?

343
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,664
Well, no, sir. Why, that was my idea.

344
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,541
I heard there's a man down there.

345
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,336
He pays folks money to sing into his can.

346
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,213
They say he pays extra,

347
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,423
if'n you play real good.

348
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,509
Tishomingo, huh?

349
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,469
How much he pay?

350
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,780
All right, boys, follow my lead.

351
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,745
Hello?

352
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,165
Who's the honcho around here?

353
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,001
I am. Who are you?

354
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,962
Well, sir, I'm Jordan Rivers

355
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,965
and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys

356
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,550
out of Cottonelia, Mississippi.

357
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:50,052
Songs of salvation to salve the soul.

358
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,390
Uh, we hear that you pay good money
to sing into a can.

360
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,724
Well, that all depends.

361
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:57,893
You boys do Negro songs?

362
00:24:01,061 --> 00:24:03,023
Well, sir, we are Negroes.

363
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:04,859
All except for our accomp... our accomp...

364
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,278
Uh, the fella that plays the guitar.

365
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,738
Yeah, well, I don't record Negro songs.

366
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,908
No, I'm lookin' for some old-timey material.

367
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:15,578
You see, people can't
seem to get enough of it,

368
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,373
since we started broadcasting it
on The Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour.

370
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,834
So thank you for stopping by, but--

371
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:26,964
Sir, the Soggy Bottom Boys have
been steeped in old-timey material.

373
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,883
Heck, we're silly with it, ain't we, boys?

374
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:29,925
That's right.

375
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,760
That's right. We ain't really Negroes.

376
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,555
All except for our accompanist.

371
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,400
# I am a man #

372
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,300
# Of constant sorrow #

373
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,400
# I've seen trouble all my days #

374
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,500
# I bid farewell #

375
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,900
# To old Kentucky #

376
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,900
# The place where I #

377
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
# Was born and raised #

378
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,000
# The place where he #

379
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,800
# Was born and raised #

380
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,300
# For six long years #

381
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,500
# I've been in trouble #

382
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:20,700
# No pleasure here #

383
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,700
# On Earth I found #

384
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,900
# For in this world #

385
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,500
# I'm bound to ramble #

386
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,900
# I have no friends #

387
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
# To help me now #

388
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,800
# He has no friends #

389
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,000
# To help him now #

390
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,700
# Maybe your friends think #

391
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,000
# I'm just a stranger #

392
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,000
# My face you never #

393
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,000
# Will see no more #

394
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,900
# But there is one promise #

395
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,900
# That is given #

396
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,900
# I'll meet you on #

397
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,200
# God's golden shore #

398
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,600
# He'll meet you on #

399
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,500
# God's golden shore #

377
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,996
Whoo! Hot damn, son!

378
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,998
I believe you did sell your soul to the devil!

379
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,332
<i>Whoo-ee!</i>

380
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,420
<i>Boy, that was some mighty fine
a-pickin' and a-singin'.</i>

381
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,005
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>

382
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,465
<i>You come on in here, you...</i>

383
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,967
<i>You sign these papers here.</i>

384
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,220
<i>I'm gonna give you $10 apiece.</i>

385
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:42,600
Okay, sir, but Mert and...

386
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,727
Aloysious'll just have to sign Xs.

387
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:47,271
Only 4 of us can write.

388
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:48,522
<i>That'd be fine.</i>

390
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,692
Whoo!

391
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,237
Hey, mister, I don't mean to be
tellin' tales out of school,

393
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,656
but there's a fella in there
who'll pay you $10,

394
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,366
if you sing into his can.

395
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:02,578
I'm not here to make a record,
you dumb cracker.

396
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,580
They broadcast me out on the radio.

397
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:08,375
That's Governor Menelaus,
"Pass the Biscuits" Pappy O'Daniel.

399
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,919
And he'd sure appreciate it,
if you ate his farina

400
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:12,421
and voted him a second term.

401
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,797
Finest governor we ever had in Mississippi.

402
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,132
In any state.

403
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,592
Oh, Lord, yes. Every parish or precinct.

404
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,719
He was makin' the bigger point.

405
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,429
Well, ain't you gonna press the flesh, Pappy?

406
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:21,597
Do a little politicking?

407
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,099
I'll press your flesh, you dimwitted sumbitch.

408
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,602
You don't tell your pappy
how to court the electorate.

409
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,228
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here.

410
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,105
We're mass communicatin'!

411
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,149
Oh, yes. That's a powerful new force.

412
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,150
Mm-hmm!

413
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,610
Shake a leg, Junior.

414
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:36,737
Thank God your mammy died givin' birth.

415
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,781
If she'd have seen you,
she'd have died of shame.

416
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,158
Well, hi there! How you doin'?

426
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,500
# Hard time yearnin'
where you go #

427
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,800
# Times is harder
than ever been before #

428
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
# And the people are driftin' #

429
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:06,000
# From door to door #

430
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,800
# Can't find no heaven #

431
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,200
# I don't care where they go #

434
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
# Say you had money #

435
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,400
# You better be sure #

436
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,400
# These hard times will drive you #

437
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,400
# From door to door #

417
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,140
Let's bed down here for the night.

418
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:50,018
Yeah, it stinks in that old barn.

419
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,520
Suits me.

420
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,188
Pretty soon it'll be nothin'

421
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:57,860
but featherbeds and silk sheets.

422
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,740
Million dollars.

423
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,908
Million-point-two.

424
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:08,036
500,000 each.

425
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,913
400, Delmar.

426
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:16,003
Pete, what are you gonna do
with your share of the treasure?

428
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,548
Go out west somewhere.

429
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,009
Open a fine restaurant.

430
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,014
I'm gonna be the maitre d'.

431
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,892
Greet all the swells.

432
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:33,479
Go to work every day in a bow tie...

433
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,773
tuxedo.

434
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,568
And all the staff say "Yes, sir" and...

435
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,111
"No, sir"...

436
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,863
and "In a jiffy, Pete."

437
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,826
And all my meals for free.

438
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,916
What about you, Delmar?

439
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,419
What are you gonna do
with your share of that dough?

440
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,298
I'm gonna visit them foreclosin' son of a guns

441
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:05,177
down at the Indianola Savings and Loan.

442
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:09,765
Slap that money on the barrel head
and buy back the family farm.

444
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:15,145
You ain't no kind of man, if you ain't got land.

445
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,398
What about you, Everett?

446
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:22,444
What you have in mind
when you stole it in the first place?

448
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:26,281
I...

449
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,951
didn't have no plan.

450
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,204
Well, that hardly sound like you.

451
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,624
- All right, boys!
- It's the authorities!

452
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,460
Your situation is purty nigh hopeless!

453
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:41,004
Damn, they found our car.

454
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,798
We ain't got the time

455
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,466
and nary the inclination

456
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,135
to chat with you boys any further.

457
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,471
Damn, we got to skedaddle.

458
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,391
I left my pomade in the car.

459
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,809
Maybe I can creep up.

460
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:54,935
Don't be a fool, Everett.

461
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,313
We got to R-U-N-N-O-F-T.

462
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,440
Where's Tommy?

463
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,109
Already lit out.

464
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,236
Scared out of his wits.

465
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,031
Let's go!

466
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,160
Well, hell, it ain't square one.

467
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:16,456
Ain't no one gonna pick up
three filthy, unshaved hitchhikers.

469
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:20,711
And one of them a know-it-all
who can't keep his trap shut.

471
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,880
Pete, the personal rancor
reflected in that remark,

472
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,215
I don't intend to dignify with comment.

473
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:29,636
But I would like to address your general
attitude of hopeless negativism.

475
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,681
Consider the lilies of the goddamn field.

476
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,893
Or, hell, take a look at Delmar here
as your paradigm of hope.

478
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,811
Yeah. Look at me.

479
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,188
Now, you may call it
an unreasoning optimism.

480
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,982
You may call it obtuse,

481
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,444
but the plain and simple fact
is that we got close to...

482
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,196
...three days before they...

483
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,579
...dam that river.

484
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,521
Is this a road to ltta Bena?

485
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,193
Uh... Itta Bena?

486
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,028
Itta Bena?

487
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:30,405
Isn't that... Isn't that, uh...

488
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,573
Stay on this here road.

489
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,574
Nah, that ain't right.

490
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,368
I was thinking of, uh...

491
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,369
Take this road--

492
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,912
Nah, nah, nah, that ain't right.

493
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,289
It seems to me there's a road,

494
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,250
cow road that used to lead all the way...

495
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,127
Well, most of the way.

496
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,879
That ain't right, either.

497
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,798
Hop on in while you give it a think.

498
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,342
Right. Delmar.

499
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,105
Any of you boys know your way
around a Walther P.P.K?

501
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,232
Well, see, that's where we can't help you.

502
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,109
I don't believe it's in Mississippi.

503
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:12,739
Friend, some of your folding
money has come unstowed.

504
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:15,742
Just stuff it down that sack there, will you?

505
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,078
You boys aren't bad men, I take it?

506
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,455
Well, it's funny you should ask.

507
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,624
I was bad till yesterday,

508
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,793
but me and Pete here been saved.

509
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,963
I'm Delmar, and that there is Everett.

510
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,297
George Nelson.

511
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,757
It's a pleasure.

512
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:33,927
Grab the tiller, will you, buddy?

513
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,444
Hand me that chopper.

514
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:45,939
Say, what line of work you in, George?

516
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,609
Come and get me, coppers!

517
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:54,114
You flatfooted, lame-brained,
soft-ass sons of bitches!

519
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,576
No one can catch me!

520
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,327
I'm George Nelson!

521
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:02,205
I'm bigger than any John, live or limp!

522
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,294
I'm ten and a half feet tall!

523
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:10,964
Cows.

524
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:14,342
I hate cows worse than coppers!

525
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,181
Oh, George. Not the livestock.

526
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,517
Come on, you miserable,
salaried sons of bitches!

527
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,685
Come and get me!

528
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:43,246
Come on, boys, we're going for the record.

529
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:44,998
3 banks in 2 hours!

530
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,801
Okay, folks, hold the applause
and drop your drawers.

531
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,385
I'm George Nelson

532
00:34:57,553 --> 00:35:00,013
and I'm here to sack the city ltta Bena!

533
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,183
He's a live wire, though, ain't he?

534
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:05,060
All the money in a bag.

535
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,228
What are you lookin' at, grandpa?

536
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,021
Pardon me, George.

537
00:35:08,189 --> 00:35:09,898
You got a plan for gettin' out of here?

538
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,900
Sure, boys.

539
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,603
Here's my plan.

540
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,197
They ain't never seen ordnance like this!

541
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,282
Thank you, folks.

542
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,701
And remember, Jesus saves,

543
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,513
but George Nelson withdraws!

544
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,748
Go fix the auto voiture, Pete.

545
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:29,209
Is that Babyface Nelson?

546
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,878
Who said that?

547
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:39,386
What ignorant, lowdown, slanderizin'
son of a bitch said that?

549
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:45,475
My name is George Nelson! Get me?

550
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:49,020
She didn't mean nothin' by it, George.

551
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,730
George Nelson!

552
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:52,315
Not Babyface!

553
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,442
You remember!

554
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,653
And you tell your friends!

555
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,406
I'm George Nelson.

556
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,158
Born to raise hell.

557
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:22,888
Well, that was some fun,
now, wasn't it, George?

558
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,014
Yeah.

559
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:27,142
Almost makes me wished
I hadn't have been saved.

560
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,977
Jacking up banks.

561
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:33,690
I can see how a fella'd derive a whole lot
of pleasure and satisfaction out of it.

563
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,151
It's okay.

564
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,611
Hoo, dawgies!

565
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,617
Well...

566
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,829
I'm takin' off.

567
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:53,835
You boys might as well

568
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,172
keep my share of the riches.

569
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,676
Well, where are you going, George?

570
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,763
I don't know.

571
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,389
Who cares?

572
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:12,312
Now, what do you suppose is eatin' George?

573
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,192
Well, Delmar, they say that
with the thrill-seeking personality,

575
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,027
what goes up must come down.

576
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,656
On top of the world one minute,
haunted by meekness the next.

577
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,575
Yes, sir, it's as if our old friend, George,

578
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:28,328
is a alley cat and his own damn humors

579
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:30,705
are swingin' him by the tail.

580
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,082
I wouldn't worry, Delmar.

581
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,709
He'll be back on top again.

582
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:40,048
I don't think we've seen
the last of George Nelson.

583
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,486
<i>Don't be saps for Pappy.</i>

584
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:04,155
<i>Homer Stokes for governor.</i>

585
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,283
<i>Let's sweep this state clean.</i>

586
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,160
<i>Vote for Stokes, brother.</i>

587
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,217
Aw, shh shh. Hang on!

588
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:26,303
I'm gonna slap one on here.

589
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,972
Folks, here's my cousin Ezra's niece,

590
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,475
Eudora, from out of Greenwood,
doin' a little number

591
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,144
with her cousin Tom-Tom,

592
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,814
which I predict you gonna enjoy thoroughly.

593
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:46,323
Now, what can I do you for, Mr. French?

594
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,701
How can I lay ahold of them
Soggy Bottom Boys?

595
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,952
Soggy Bottom.

596
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,455
I don't precisely recollect them.

597
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,623
They cut a record in here a few days ago

598
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,208
with an old-timey harmony thing

599
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,544
with a guitar accompani... accompani...

600
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:02,797
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember them.

601
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,841
Colored fellas, I believe.

602
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,594
Yes, sir, they a fine bunch of boys.

603
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:10,805
They sang into yonder can, then skedaddled.

604
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:15,310
Well, that record is just goin'
through the goddamn roof.

606
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,979
- They playin' it as far away as Mobile.
- No.

608
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,023
Whole damn state's goin' apey.

609
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:23,526
Well, it was a powerful air.

610
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,028
Hot damn, we got to find them boys

611
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,322
and sign 'em to a big fat contract.

612
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:31,451
Hell's bells, Mr. Lund, if we don't,
the goddamn competition will.

614
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:34,996
Oh, mercy, yes, we got
to beat that competition.

615
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,664
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

Do you have the Soggy Bottom Boys

618
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,809

00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,479
No, ma'am. We got
a new shipment in yesterday.

620
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,799
Sorry, but we just can't
keep 'em on our shelves.

Pull over! Pull over!

626
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,126
Guess old Pete's got the itch.

642
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,200
# Go to sleep, you little baby #

643
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:19,400

Howdy do, ladies?

628
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,943
Name of Pete.

647
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,100
# Go to sleep, you little baby #

648
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,300
# Everybody's gone
in the cotton and the corn #

649
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:47,100
# Didn't leave nobody but the baby #

629
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,082
Ain't you gonna introduce us, Pete?

630
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,500
I don't know their names.

631
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,419
I seen 'em first!

652
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,000
# You're sweet, little baby #

653
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,900
# Honey in the rock
and the sugar don't stop #

654
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:06,500
# Gonna bring a bottle to the baby #

655
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,400
# Don't you weep, pretty baby #

656
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:15,100
# Don't you weep, pretty baby #

657
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,100
# She's long gone with her red shoes on #

658
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,700
# Gonna need another lovin' baby #

658
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,800
# Go to sleep, you little baby #

632
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,166
Ladies, my name is Ulysses Everett McGill,

633
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,600
# Go to sleep, you little baby #

633
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:34,712
and, well, you three ladies are about the...

661
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,400
# You and me and the Devil makes three #

634
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,922
the prettiest...

662
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,900
# Don't need no other lovin' baby #

635
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,431
water lilies...

633
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,000
# Go to sleep, you little baby #

636
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,228
Corn liquor.

633
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,500
# Go to sleep, you little baby #

6
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:57,800
# You and me and the Devil makes three #

667
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:04,000
# Don't need no other lovin' baby #

668
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,400
# Go to sleep, you little baby #

669
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,000
# Go to sleep, you little baby #

670
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,100
# Your mama's gone away,
and your daddy's gonna stay #

671
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:22,000
# Didn't leave nobody but the baby #

672
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,500
# Go to sleep, you little baby #

673
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,000
# Go to sleep, you little baby #

674
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:35,500
# Come lay your bones
on the alabaster stones #

675
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:41,300
# And be my everlovin' baby #

637
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:24,617
Everett.

637
00:46:26,797 --> 00:46:27,717
Everett.

638
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,368
My hair!

639
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:32,413
Look at this.

640
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,554
Pete!

641
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,098
Where the heck are you?

642
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,183
Pete!

643
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:56,229
We ain't got time for hide-and-seek!

644
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,441
Now, we ain't got time for your shenanigans!

645
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:03,778
Sweet Jesus, Everett.

646
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,363
They left his heart.

648
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,473
What the... Delmar,
what the heck's got into you?

649
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,183
Can't you see it, Everett?

650
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,978
Them sirens did this to Pete.

651
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:42,275
They loved him up and turned him
into a horny toad.

653
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,490
Pete!

654
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,159
Pete! Pete!

655
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:59,292
Pete!

656
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:11,345
Pete, it's me, Delmar.

657
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:13,514
It's me, Delmar.

658
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,017
Everett.

659
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,143
Delmar, what the...

660
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:20,521
What are we gonna do?

661
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,909
I'm not sure that's Pete.

662
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,370
Of course it's Pete. Look at him.

663
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:41,083
We got to find some kind of...
wizard can change him back.

664
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:46,589
I'm just not sure that's Pete.

665
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:53,554
You can't display a toad
in a fine restaurant like this.

667
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:55,556
Why, the good folks here'd go
right off their feed.

668
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:59,644
Hey. I just don't think it's right
keeping him under wraps,

670
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,270
like we was ashamed of him.

671
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,564
Well, if it is Pete, I am ashamed of him.

672
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,232
The way I see it, he got what he deserved.

673
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,069
Fornicating with some whore of Babylon.

674
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:10,196
These things don't happen
for no reason, Delmar.

675
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,698
It's obviously some kind of
judgment on Pete's character.

676
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,992
Well, the two of us was fixin' to fornicate.

677
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,206
You're gonna have to excuse
my rusticated friend,

678
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:23,793
unaccustomed as he is to city manners.

679
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,086
Hmm?

680
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,380
I guess we'll have ourselves

681
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,589
a couple of steaks

682
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:30,800
and some gratine potatoes

683
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,469
and wash it down with some
of your finest bubbly wine.

684
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,055
Oh, and I don't suppose you have any...

685
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,476
Maybe the chef could prepare...

686
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,563
Just bring us a couple
of leaves of raw cabbage.

687
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:45,564
Yes, sir.

688
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:46,565
Thank you.

689
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:47,817
That kind of barnyard language--

690
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:49,527
I don't believe I've seen
you boys around here before.

691
00:49:49,695 --> 00:49:50,945
Allow me to introduce myself.

692
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,488
Name of Daniel Teague,

693
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,157
known in these precincts
as Big Dan Teague.

694
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,784
Or to those who are pressed for time,

695
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:57,952
Big Dan tout court!

696
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,495
How you doin', Big Dan?

697
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:00,955
My name's Ulysses Everett McGill.

698
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,541
This is my associate Delmar O'Donnel.

699
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:04,834
I detect, like me,

700
00:50:04,852 --> 00:50:06,752
you're endowed with the gift of gab.

701
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,504
I flatter myself that such is the case.

702
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,923
In my line of work, it's plumb necessary.

703
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,925
The one thing you don't want...

704
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:17,138
is air in the conversation.

705
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,931
Once again we find ourselves in agreement.

706
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:20,641
What kind of work you do, Big Dan?

707
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:23,144
Sales, Mr. McGill, sales!
And what do I sell?

708
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,479
The truth, every blessed word of it.

709
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,648
From Genesis on down to Revelations.

710
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,250
That's right, the Word of God,

711
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,403
which, let me tell you,
there is damn good money in

712
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,780
during these times of woe and want.

713
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,323
People are lookin' for answers

714
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:39,160
and Big Dan sells
the only book that's got 'em.

715
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:44,040
And what do you do
you and your... tongue-tied friend?

717
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,459
We...

718
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,294
We're adventurers, sir.

719
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,171
Currently pursuing a certain opportunity,

720
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,339
but we're open to others as well.

721
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:53,674
I like your style, young man,

722
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,593
so I'm gonna propose you a proposition.

723
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:58,304
You cover my bill, so I don't
have to run back upstairs,

724
00:50:58,372 --> 00:51:00,389
get your waitress to wrap
your dinner picnic-style,

725
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,184
and we shall retire
to more private environs,

726
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:06,187
where I will tell you how there
are vast amounts of money

727
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:08,189
to be made in the service of God almighty.

728
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:12,193
Well, why not? If nothin' else,
I can use some civilized conversation.

730
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,779
Don't forget your shoe box, friend.

731
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,030
Languishin'!

732
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,240
Goddamn campaign is languishin'!

733
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,909
We need a shot in the arm.

734
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,995
You hear me, boys?
In the goddamn arm!

735
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,121
Election held tomorrow,

736
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,624
that son of bitch Stokes
would win it in a walk!

737
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:30,669
Well, he's the reform candidate, Daddy.

738
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:31,670
Yeah?

739
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,672
A lot of people like that reform.

740
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:36,467
Maybe we should get us some.

741
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:39,553
I'll reform you, you soft-headed son of a bitch.

742
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,264
How we gonna run reform
when we're the damn incumbent?

743
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,517
Is that the best idea
you boys can come up with?

744
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,726
Reform?!

745
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,853
Weepin' Jesus on the cross.

746
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,230
That's it!

747
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:53,192
You may as well start drafting
my concession speech right now.

748
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,402
Okay, Pappy.

749
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,780
I'm just making a point,
you stupid son of a bitch.

750
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,990
Give me back that hat! Hurry up!

751
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,242
Pappy's just makin' a point.

752
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,493
Shut up!

753
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,512
Thank you, boys, for throwing in
that fricassee.

754
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,013
I'm a man of large appetites

755
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:24,306
and even with lunch under my belt,

756
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,267
I was feeling a mite peckish.

757
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,518
It's our pleasure, Big Dan.

758
00:52:27,686 --> 00:52:31,313
Thank you as well for
the conversational hiatus.

759
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,191
I generally refrain from
speech during gustation.

760
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,861
There are those who attempt
both at the same time.

761
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:39,780
I find it coarse and vulgar.

762
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,031
Where were we?

763
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,117
Making money in the Lord's service.

764
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,119
You don't say much, friend, but when you do,

765
00:52:45,187 --> 00:52:46,829
it's to the point and I salute you for it.

766
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,873
Yes, Bible sales.

767
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,625
Now, the trade is not a complicated one.

768
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,377
There are but two things to learn.

769
00:52:53,405 --> 00:52:55,212
One being where to find a wholesaler,

770
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,047
the Word of God in bulk, as it were.

771
00:52:57,065 --> 00:52:59,675
Two, how to recognize your customer.

772
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,218
Who are you dealing with?

773
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:04,513
It's an exercise in psychology, so to speak.

774
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:07,683
And it is that which I propose

775
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:11,145
to give you a lesson in right now.

776
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:16,400
Why, I like to think I'm a pretty astute
observer of the human scene, too, Big Dan.

778
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:18,068
No doubt, brother.

779
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,695
I figured as much back at the restaurant.

780
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:22,698
That's why I invited you all out here

781
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,700
for this advanced tutorial.

783
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,912
What's going on, Big Dan?

784
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,079
It's all about the money, boys!

785
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,123
That's it!

786
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:36,086
Gol... durned... money!

787
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:37,254
I don't get it, Big Dan.

789
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,220
I just take your show cards...

791
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,688
...and whatever you got in the hole.

792
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,012
What the...

793
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,156
There ain't nothin' but a damn toad.

794
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:07,368
No, you don't understand.

795
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:08,577
That's Pete.

796
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,291
Pete.

797
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:18,003
You know these things give you warts?

798
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,096
End of lesson.

799
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,067
So long, boys.

800
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,603
See you in the funny papers.

801
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,439
Y'all seen the end of Big Dan Teague.

802
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,339
Where are they?

803
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:06,510
Talk, you unreconstructed whelp of a whore!

804
00:55:06,678 --> 00:55:07,678
Where they headed?

806
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,849
Your screams ain't gonna save your flesh.

808
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,102
Only your tongue is, boy.
Where they headed?

810
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,035
Lump, I.O.

811
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:41,962
Sweet summer rain.

812
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:46,717
Like God's own mercy.

813
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,971
Your two friends have abandoned you, Pete.

814
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:54,516
They don't seem to care about your hide.

815
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,190
Okay.

816
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,739
Stairway to heaven.

817
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,911
We shall all meet by-and-by.

818
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,789
Goddamn it!

819
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,417
God forgive me!

820
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:22,086
Hold.

821
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:37,559
Believe me, Delmar, he would
have wanted us to press on.

822
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,604
Pete, rest his soul, was

823
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:42,606
one sour ass son of a bitch

824
00:56:42,674 --> 00:56:45,484
and not given to acts of
pointless sentimentality.

825
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,737
It just don't seem right digging up
that treasure without him.

827
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,739
Maybe it's for the best he was squished.

828
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,658
Why, he...

829
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,619
was barely a sentient being and...

830
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,454
well, as soon as we get
ourselves cleaned up,

831
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,206
and we get a little smellum in our hair,

832
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:02,292
why, we're gonna feel
100% better about ourselves,

833
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:05,462
and about life in general.

834
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,591
Must be near Parchman Farm.

835
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,719
Sorry sons of bitches.

836
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:16,515
Seems like a year ago
we busted off the farm.

837
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:27,526
Pete got a brother?

838
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:30,237
Not that I'm aware.

839
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,409
Heat must be getting to me.

00:58:33,134 --> 00:58:34,134
Yes.

842
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,638
Now, I know the Sunnysiders
would agree with me,

843
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:40,224
when I say the great state of Mississippi

844
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:44,394
cannot afford four more years
of Pappy O'Daniel!

845
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:47,356
Four more years of cronyism!

846
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:50,526
Nepotism! Rascalism!

847
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,570
Of service to the interests!

848
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:57,991
Now, the choice, she's a clear 'un.

849
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:01,537
Pappy O'Daniel, slave of the interests.

850
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:05,082
Homer Stokes, servant of the little man.

851
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,250
Ain't that right, little fella?

852
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:07,709
He ain't lyin'!

853
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:11,922
Ladies and gentlemen,
the little man has admonished me

854
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,550
to grasp the broom of reform

855
00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,344
and sweep this state clean!

856
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:21,098
It's gonna be, "Back to the flour mill, Pappy!"

857
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:23,267
The interests can take care of themselves.

858
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,768
Come Tuesday,

859
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:27,646
we're gonna sweep the rascals out!

860
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:33,443
Clean government is yours for the asking!

861
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,365
Folks, now the little Wharvey gals!

862
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:42,077
Wharvey gals?

863
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:44,371
Did he just say little Wharvey gals?

864
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:47,124
Come here, girls.

865
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,709
What y'all gonna sing for us?

866
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:50,961
"In the highways"

867
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,046
Goddamn it all!

868
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,298
You know them gals, Everett?

865
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,700
# In the highways #

866
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,600
# In the hedges #

867
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,100
# In the highways #

868
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,800
# In the hedges #

869
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:04,300
# In the highways #

870
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,300
# In the hedges #

871
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:10,400
# I'll be somewhere
a-working for my Lord #

872
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,000
# I'll be somewhere a-working #

873
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,300
# I'll be somewhere a-working #

874
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:19,600
# I'll be somewhere
a-working for my Lord #

875
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,700
# I'll be somewhere a-working #

876
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,500
# I'll be somewhere a-working #

877
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:28,000
# I'll be somewhere
a-working for my Lord #

869
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,251
Hey, girls!

870
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,795
Daddy!

872
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,342
Daddy? He ain't our daddy.

873
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,093
Hell, I ain't. What's this Wharvey gals?

874
01:00:40,161 --> 01:00:41,261
Your name's McGill.

875
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:44,181
No, sir. Not since you got hit by that train.

876
01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:46,433
What are you talking about?
I wasn't hit by any train.

877
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:48,060
Mama says you was hit by a train.

878
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:50,187
- Blooey!
- Nothin' left.

879
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,147
Just a grease spot on the L & N.

880
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,608
Damn it, I wasn't hit by any train!

881
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,777
That's why Mama's got us back to Wharvey.

882
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:58,362
That's her maiden name.

883
01:00:58,529 --> 01:01:00,072
You got a maiden name, Daddy?

884
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,307
No, Daddy don't have a maiden name.

885
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,867
- See--
- That's your misfortune.

886
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,203
That's right, and now
Mama's got a new beau.

887
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,704
He's a suitor.

888
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,665
Yeah, I heard about that.

889
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:13,001
Mama says he's bona fide.

890
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,336
Mmm.

891
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:15,837
He give her a ring?

892
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,339
Yes, sir. A big 'un.

893
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:20,092
- Gotta gem.
- Mama checked it.

894
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,426
It's bona fide.

895
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,469
He's a suitor.

896
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:23,512
What's his name?

897
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,180
Vernon T. Waldrip.

898
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,181
Uncle Vernon.

899
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,432
Till tomorrow.

900
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:28,725
Then he's gonna be Daddy.

901
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:30,852
I am the only daddy you got.

902
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:32,479
I am the damn pater familias.

903
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,523
But you ain't bona fide.

904
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:39,611
Where's your mama?

905
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,238
She's at the five-and-dime.

906
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,531

909
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:05,554
How's my little girl?

910
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,389
Hi.

911
01:02:07,557 --> 01:02:08,598
Who the hell's that?

912
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:10,100
Starla Wharvey.

913
01:02:10,268 --> 01:02:12,269
Starla McGill, you mean.

914
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:13,812
How come you never told me about her?

915
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,272
'Cause you was hit by a train.

916
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,066
That's another thing. Why are you
telling our gals I was hit by a train?

918
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,068
Lots of respectable people
been hit by trains.

919
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:22,988
Judge Hobby over in Cookville
was hit by a train.

920
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,406
What was I supposed to tell 'em?

921
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:27,784
That you were sent to the penal farm
and I divorced you from shame?

923
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,000
I take your point.

924
01:02:29,014 --> 01:02:30,954
But it does put me in
a damned awkward position

925
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:32,539
vis à vis my progeny.

926
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:33,623
Hello, Penny.

927
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:37,369
Is this gentlemen bothering you?

928
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:41,381
You Waldrip?

929
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:43,842
Uh-huh. That's right.

930
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,428
Hmm.

931
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,649
You been using my hair treatment?

932
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,985
Your hair treatment?

933
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:03,945
Excuse me.

934
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,734
I got news for you.

935
01:03:08,752 --> 01:03:11,328
In case you hadn't noticed,
I wasn't hit by a train,

936
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,955
and I have traveled many a weary mile

937
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:18,960
to be back with my wife
and my six daughters.

938
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,712
Seven, Daddy!

939
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,380
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle.

940
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,673
Your daddy was hit by a train.

941
01:03:23,841 --> 01:03:25,342
Penny, you stop that!

942
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,469
No, you stop it! Vernon here's got a job.

943
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,679
Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide.

944
01:03:29,847 --> 01:03:30,889
What are you?

945
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,891
I'll tell you what I am.

946
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:36,102
I am the pater familias,
and you can't marry him!

947
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:39,231
I can, I am, and I will, tomorrow.

948
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:40,941
I got to think about the little Wharvey gals.

949
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:42,317
They look to me for answers.

950
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,862
Vernon can support 'em and
buy 'em lessons on the clarinet.

952
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,824
The only good thing you ever did
for the gals was get hit by that train!

954
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:54,287
Why, you lying unconstant succubus.

955
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:55,539
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

956
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:58,542
You can't swear at my fiancee!

957
01:03:58,709 --> 01:03:59,543
Oh, yeah?

958
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,045
Well, you can't marry my wife!

960
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,236
Who is that man?

961
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,091
He's not my husband.

962
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:33,493
Just a drifter, I guess.

963
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,453
Just some no-account drifter.

965
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,543
And stay out of Woolworth's!

966
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:49,801
<i>I'll bet she does imitations, too.</i>

967
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:54,389
Deceitful, two-faced she-wolf.

968
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,600
Never trust a female, Delmar.

969
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:58,101
Remember that one simple precept

970
01:04:58,129 --> 01:05:00,687
and your time with me
will not have been ill-spent.

971
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:01,980
Okay, Everett.

972
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,940
"Hit by a train."

973
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,693
Truth means nothing to a woman, Delmar.

974
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,028
Triumph of the subjective.

975
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,113
You ever been with a woman?

976
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:12,908
Well, I've...

977
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:15,493
I got to get the family farm back,

978
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,287
before I can start thinking about that.

979
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,456
That's right. If then.

980
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:21,875
Believe me, Delmar,
a woman is the most fiendish

981
01:05:22,043 --> 01:05:26,630
instrument of torture ever devised
to bedevil the days of man.

983
01:05:26,797 --> 01:05:29,716
Everett, I never figured you
for a pater familias.

984
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:34,638
Oh, yes. I have spread my seed.

985
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,139
And look what it's...

986
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:41,519
Goddamn it. What the hell's going on?

987
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:44,249
Okay, boys. Enjoy your picture show.

988
01:06:56,637 --> 01:07:02,726
Do... not... seek the treasure.

989
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,813
Do... not...

990
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:08,732
seek the treasure.

991
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:12,694
It's a bushwhack.

992
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:15,822
They're fixin' an ambush.

993
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:19,659
Do... not... seek the treasure.

994
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,206
We...

995
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:29,252
We thought you was...

996
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,879
a toad.

997
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:38,011
We... thought...

998
01:07:38,179 --> 01:07:42,974
you... was... a toad.

999
01:07:43,142 --> 01:07:49,147
Do... not... seek... the treasure.

1000
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:51,733
- Quiet there!
- Watch the picture!

1001
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,990
I signed that bill.

1002
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,285
I signed a dozen agriculture bills.

1003
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,288
Everyone knows I'm a friend of the farmer.

1004
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,249
What do I gotta do, start tending livestock?

1005
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,043
We can't do that, Daddy.

1006
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,087
We might offend our constituency.

1007
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:13,713
We ain't got a constituency!

1008
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,799
Stokes got a constituency!

1009
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:20,136
Well, it's a well-run campaign.

1010
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,805
Midget and broom and whatnot.

1011
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,264
Devil his due.

1012
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,974
Hell of an organization.

1013
01:08:25,142 --> 01:08:27,477
Say, I got an idea.

1014
01:08:27,645 --> 01:08:28,812
What's that, junior?

1015
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:32,315
We can hire us a little fella
even smaller than Stokes's.

1017
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,734
You slump-shouldered sack of nuts!

1018
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:37,862
Why, we'd look like a bunch
of Johnny-come-latelys,

1019
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:40,115
breakin' out our own midget.

1020
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:41,950
Don't matter how stumpy!

1021
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,701
And that's the goddamn problem right there.

1022
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,955
People think Stokes has got fresh ideas.

1023
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:49,249
He's au courant and we're the past!

1024
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,126
It's a problem of...

1025
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,669
- Perception.
- That's right.

1026
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,462
Reason why he's pulling our pants down.

1027
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:55,839
Gonna paddle a little behind.

1028
01:08:56,006 --> 01:08:58,258
Ain't gonna paddle it.
Gonna kick it. Real hard.

1029
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:00,051
No, I believe he's gonna paddle it.

1030
01:09:00,219 --> 01:09:02,137
I don't believe that's a proper description.

1031
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,931
Well, that's how I'd characterize it.

1032
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,600
I believe it's more of a kickin' situation.

1033
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:28,454
God... God forgive me.

1034
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:33,001
I could not gaze upon that far shore.

1035
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,252
Pete.

1036
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,213
Hold still!

1037
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:41,050
Can't... stand much longer.

1038
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:44,846
It was... it was a moment of weakness.

1039
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,806
Quit yer babblin', Pete.
We gotta skedaddle.

1040
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,766
That's all I got.

1041
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:51,686
They lured me out for a bathe,

1042
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:54,731
and then they dunked me,
trussed me up like a hog,

1043
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:56,608
and turned me in for the bounty.

1044
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:57,984
I should have guessed it.

1045
01:09:58,152 --> 01:09:59,235
Typical womanly behavior.

1046
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:01,905
We're just lucky we left
before they came back for us.

1048
01:10:02,072 --> 01:10:03,948
We didn't abandon you, Pete.

1049
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,284
We just thought you was a toad.

1050
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:08,870
No, they never did turn me into a toad.

1051
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:11,915
Well, that was our mistake then.

1052
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:14,459
And we was beat up by a bible salesman

1053
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:17,086
and banished from Woolworths.

1054
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:20,381
I don't know, Everett.
Was it the one branch or all of them?

1056
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,384
Well, I ain't had it easy, either, boys.

1057
01:10:23,552 --> 01:10:29,182
Frankly... Well, I...

1058
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,768
I spilt my guts about the treasure.

1059
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,645
Huh?

1060
01:10:33,812 --> 01:10:39,108
I'm awful sorry I betrayed you, fellas.

1061
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:41,319
Must be my Hogwallop blood.

1062
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,740
That's all right, Pete.

1063
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,993
Awful white of you to take it like that, Everett.

1064
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:51,788
I feel wretched.

1065
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:55,625
Spoiling your play
for a million dollar point two.

1066
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,795
It's been eatin' at my guts.

1067
01:10:58,963 --> 01:11:01,297
Oh, that's all right.

1068
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:05,804
You boys are true friends!

1069
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,765
You're my boon companions.

1070
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:14,894
Pete, I don't want you to beat
yourself up about this, eh?

1072
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:21,067
I can't help it, but that's
a wonderful thing to say.

1074
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,239
Yeah.

1075
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:29,492
Pete...

1076
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:33,496
The fact of the matter is...

1077
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:38,543
Damn it.

1078
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:39,836
There ain't no treasure.

1079
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,508
Fact of the matter is there never was.

1080
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:47,510
But...

1081
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:52,015
So, where's all the money
from the armored car job?

1082
01:11:53,559 --> 01:11:56,769
Never knocked over no armored car.

1083
01:11:56,937 --> 01:12:00,106
Sent up for practicing law without a license.

1084
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:01,107
But...

1085
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:03,026
Damn it, I had to bust out.

1086
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:07,088
My wife wrote me she was
getting married, I gotta stop it.

1088
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:10,783
I had two weeks left on my sentence.

1089
01:12:10,951 --> 01:12:11,826
I couldn't wait two weeks.

1090
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,077
She's getting married tomorrow.

1091
01:12:13,245 --> 01:12:16,539
My added time for the escape,

1092
01:12:16,707 --> 01:12:21,461
I don't get out now till 19... 87.

1093
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:23,463
I am sorry about that.

1094
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,174
I'll be...

1095
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,635
84 years old.

1096
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:33,097
I guess they'll tack on 50 years for me, too.

1097
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:36,225
Boys, we was chained together.

1098
01:12:36,393 --> 01:12:37,727
I had to tell you something.

1099
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,563
Busting out alone was not an option.

1100
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,273
I'm sorry.

1101
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,986
84 years old.

1102
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:50,281
Well, I'll only be 82.

1103
01:12:50,449 --> 01:12:52,950
You! You ruined my life!

1105
01:12:54,119 --> 01:12:56,454
You ruined my life!

1106
01:12:56,622 --> 01:12:58,748
I do apologize about that, Pete.

1107
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:01,167
84 years old!

1108
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:03,294
I'm becoming Papillon!

1109
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:05,129
Delmar!

1110
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:11,427
Now, boys. Boys!

01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:16,300
# Oh death #

1068
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:21,500
# Whoa death #

1069
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:27,200
# Won't you spare me over till another year? #

1070
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:35,700
# Well, I am death, none can excel #

1071
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,800
# I'll open the door to heaven or hell #

1072
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,900
# Whoa, death, someone would pray #

1073
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,000
# Could you wait to call me another day? #

1111
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:51,486
That's Tommy. They got Tommy.

1112
01:14:55,115 --> 01:14:56,282
Noose.

1113
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:02,663
Sweet Jesus, we got to save him.

1079
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:07,600
# I'll fix your feet till you can't walk #

1080
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:12,200
# I'll lock your jaw till you can't talk #

1081
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:16,200
# I'll close your eyes so you can't see #

1114
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,013
The color guard.

1083
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:24,500
# Death, I come to take the soul #

1084
01:15:24,700 --> 01:15:29,000
# Leave the body and leave it cold #

1085
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,800
# Oh death #

1086
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:37,400
# Whoa death #

1087
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:42,900
# Won't you spare me over till another year? #

1115
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,041
Brothers!

1116
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:51,087
Oh, brothers!

1117
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:54,423
We have all gathered here

1118
01:15:54,591 --> 01:15:59,262
to preserve our hallowed
culture and heritage

1119
01:15:59,429 --> 01:16:01,514
from intrusion,

1120
01:16:01,682 --> 01:16:03,516
inclusion,

1121
01:16:03,684 --> 01:16:05,434
and dilution

1122
01:16:05,602 --> 01:16:08,437
of color, of creed

1123
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:10,773
and of our old-time religion.

1124
01:16:10,941 --> 01:16:15,444
We aim to pull evil up by the root

1125
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:17,738
before it chokes out

1126
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:21,784
the flower of our culture and heritage.

1127
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:22,785
And our women.

1128
01:16:22,953 --> 01:16:25,788
Let's not forget those ladies, y'all,

1129
01:16:25,956 --> 01:16:28,916
Iooking to us for protection

1130
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:30,376
from darkies,

1131
01:16:30,544 --> 01:16:31,961
from jews,

1132
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,921
from papists,

1133
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:39,969
and from all those smart-ass folks say
we come descended from monkeys.

1135
01:16:40,137 --> 01:16:42,096
That's not my culture and heritage.

1136
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,306
<b>Yes!</b>

1137
01:16:43,473 --> 01:16:44,974
Is that your culture and heritage?

1138
01:16:45,142 --> 01:16:47,351
<b>No!</b>

1139
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:50,187
And so...

1140
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,315
we gonna hang us a Negro.

1141
01:16:52,482 --> 01:16:55,443
<b>Hooray!</b>

1142
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:08,080
I ain't never harmed you.

1143
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:09,665
Neither of you gentlemen.

1146
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:34,982
I ain't never harmed nobody.

1147
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,197
- Hey, hey, Tommy.
- Huh?

1149
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:43,282
Tommy, we come to rescue you.

1150
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:45,618
That's mighty kind of you boys,

1151
01:17:45,686 --> 01:17:49,038
but I don't think nothing's
gonna save me now.

1152
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:52,209
The devil's come to collect his due.

1153
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,378
Don't be crazy, Tommy.

1154
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:57,380
You don't want to get hanged.

1155
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,715
Well, nah, I don't reckon I do,

1156
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,468
but that's the way it seems to be working out.

1157
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,139
Listen, Tommy, I got a plan.

1158
01:18:10,268 --> 01:18:11,644
<b>No!</b>

1159
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:18,818
The color guard is colored.

1160
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:22,154
Who made them the color guard?

1161
01:18:25,826 --> 01:18:28,202
Run, boys!

1162
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:34,667
Whoa!

1163
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:35,960
No, no, son!

1164
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,215
Can't let that flag touch the ground!

1167
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,701
- Leave me alone.
- Get your hands off me.

1168
01:19:08,869 --> 01:19:12,079
I can do this myself. Get away from me.

1169
01:19:12,247 --> 01:19:14,749
I'm saying we should hire this man away.

1170
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:15,791
That's a good idea, Pappy.

1171
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:16,792
Hell of an idea.

1172
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:17,793
Can't beat 'em, join 'em.

1173
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:20,838
Have him join us. Run our campaign
instead of that egghead's.

1175
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:23,048
Enticements of power, wealth, et cetera.

1176
01:19:23,216 --> 01:19:25,301
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.

1177
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:26,385
Oh, gracious, no.

1178
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:27,803
Not with his blandishments.

1179
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:28,971
And powers of persuasion.

1180
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:30,306
What's his name again?

1181
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:31,307
The campaign manager?

1182
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:32,308
Yes.

1183
01:19:32,476 --> 01:19:33,309
Waldrip.

1184
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:34,310
Vernon Waldrip.

1185
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:35,311
Vernon T. Waldrip.

1186
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:36,395
Hmm.

1187
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,362
It's an invitation-only affair.

1188
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,531
We'll have to sneak in
through the service entrance.

1190
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:48,532
Hold on.

1191
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:50,201
Wait a minute.

1192
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:52,703
Who elected you leader of this outfit?

1193
01:19:52,871 --> 01:19:55,080
Since we've been following your lead,

1194
01:19:55,248 --> 01:19:57,082
we got nothing but trouble.

1195
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:00,044
I've gotten this close to being strung up,

1196
01:20:00,212 --> 01:20:03,380
and consumed in a fire,
and whipped no end,

1197
01:20:03,548 --> 01:20:05,382
and sunstroked, and soggied.

1198
01:20:05,550 --> 01:20:07,051
And turned into a frog.

1199
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,761
He wasn't turned into a frog.

1200
01:20:08,929 --> 01:20:11,889
Almost loved up, though.

1201
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:17,000
So, you're against me now, too?

1202
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:18,687
Is that how it is, boys?

1203
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:23,067
The whole world

1204
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:25,194
and God almighty.

1205
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:26,612
Now you?

1206
01:20:30,534 --> 01:20:32,576
I guess I deserve it.

1207
01:20:34,579 --> 01:20:36,372
Boys...

1208
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:39,509
I know that I made some tactical mistakes,

1209
01:20:40,377 --> 01:20:41,794
but if you just stick with me,

1210
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:45,548
I got a plan. Believe me, boys,
we can fix this thing,

1212
01:20:45,715 --> 01:20:47,975
and I can get my wife back,
and we can get out of here.

1214
01:20:52,264 --> 01:20:55,432
Goddamn disgrace!

1215
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,060
Made a travesty of the entire evening.

1217
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:02,231
What I wouldn't give to get
ahold of those agitators.

1218
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,191
I mean, whoever heard of such behavior,

1219
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:06,068
even amongst the colored?

1220
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,194
Or mulattos, maybe.

1221
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,613
I suspect some miscegenation
in their heritage.

1222
01:21:09,781 --> 01:21:11,073
How else you going to explain it?

1223
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,576
Using a confederate flag as a missile.

1224
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:17,413
Crazy! No one's ever going to believe
we're a real band.

1226
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:18,539
No. It's going to work.

1227
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,541
I just got to get close enough to talk to her.

1228
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,627
Taking off with us has got more future
than marrying some guy named Waldrip.

1230
01:21:23,795 --> 01:21:25,462
I'm goddamn bona fide.

1231
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:26,922
I got the answers.

1232
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,382
Everett, my beard itches.

1233
01:21:34,848 --> 01:21:36,056
Hey. Hey.

1234
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,189
"In the Jailhouse Now", fellers,

1235
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:46,233
neighborhood of "B."

1237
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:55,075
Penny.

1239
01:21:58,079 --> 01:21:59,580
It's me.

1240
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,041
No.

1241
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,169
Honey, honey.

1176
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:09,100
# I had a friend named Ramblin' Bob #

1177
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,200
# He used to steal, gamble and rob #

1178
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:17,600
# He thought he was the smartest guy around #

1242
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:22,144
We're leaving the state.

1243
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:23,979
Pursuing opportunities in another venue.

1244
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:26,315
I got big plans.

1245
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:29,276
Not minstrels, this here's just a dodge.
I'm going to be a dentist.

1247
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:32,863
I know this guy who'll print me up a license.

1184
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,800
# He's in the jailhouse now #

1185
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:41,400
# Well, I told him once or twice #

1186
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,700
# To stop playin' cards and a-shootin' dice #

1187
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:49,300
# He's in the jailhouse now #

1194
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:12,100
# Bob liked to play his poker #

1248
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:16,365
Why, that is an improper suggestion.

1249
01:23:16,533 --> 01:23:21,704
I can't switch sides
in the middle of a campaign.

1251
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:25,374
Especially to work for a man
who lacks moral fiber.

1252
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:26,834
Moral fiber?

1253
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,919
Why, you little pasty-face sumbitch.

1254
01:23:29,087 --> 01:23:30,754
I invented moral fiber.

1255
01:23:30,922 --> 01:23:33,382
Pappy O'Daniel was displaying
rectitude and high-mindedness

1257
01:23:33,550 --> 01:23:36,885
when that egghead you work for
was still messing his drawers.

1259
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:38,345
Honey.

1260
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,888
Go away.

1261
01:23:40,056 --> 01:23:42,558
I want to be what you want me to be, honey.

1262
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,226
I want you and the gals to come with me.

1263
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:45,602
What, dear?

1205
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:50,500
# To stop playin' cards and a-shootin' dice #

1264
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:54,278
What are you doing here, Pappy?

1265
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:56,572
Well, I guess someone let on
we was giving out liquor.

1267
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,742
Yeah, well, you'll be laughing out the
other side of your face come November.

1269
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:01,702
Pappy O'Daniel will be laughing then.

1270
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,579
Not out the other side of his face, though.

1271
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,622
Oh, no, no, no. Just the regular side.

1272
01:24:19,137 --> 01:24:20,721
They're my daughters, too, Penny.

1273
01:24:21,889 --> 01:24:24,308
Ain't you ever heard of amor fidelis?

1215
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,900
# In constant sorrow #

1216
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:47,300
# I am the man #

1217
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:50,000
# Of constant sorrow #

1218
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:52,900
# I've seen trouble #

1274
01:24:53,088 --> 01:24:55,839
Hot damn! It's the Soggy Bottom Boys!

1220
01:24:56,600 --> 01:25:01,000
# I bid farewell #

1221
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:03,200
# To old Kentucky #

1222
01:25:03,500 --> 01:25:08,900
# The place where I was born and raised #

1223
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,700
# The place where he #

1224
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,800
# Was born and raised #

1277
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:36,505
Holy moley!

1278
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:37,840
These boys are a hit!

1279
01:25:38,007 --> 01:25:40,509
But, Pappy, they's integrated.

1280
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:43,053
Wait a minute.

1281
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:45,722
Well, I guess folks don't mind
they's integrated.

1282
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:48,183
You's miscegenated.

1283
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:50,310
All you boys is miscegenated!

1284
01:25:50,478 --> 01:25:51,520
Give me the microphone!

1285
01:25:51,688 --> 01:25:54,940
Give me the microphone!
Give me the microphone!

1286
01:25:55,108 --> 01:25:57,192
These boys is not white.

1287
01:25:57,360 --> 01:25:58,735
These boys is not white.

1288
01:25:58,903 --> 01:26:00,529
Hell, they ain't even old-timey.

1289
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:03,282
Look, I happen to know,
ladies and gentlemen

1290
01:26:03,449 --> 01:26:05,200
that this band of miscreants here,

1291
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:06,326
this very evening,

1292
01:26:06,354 --> 01:26:08,245
interfered with a lynch mob

1293
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:11,999
in the performance of its duties.

1294
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,625
Oh, yeah, it's true.

1295
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:16,378
See, I belong to a certain secret society.

1296
01:26:16,546 --> 01:26:19,673
I don't believe I got to mention
its name, you know?

1297
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:22,342
<i>Let 'em play! Go on!</i>

1299
01:26:24,137 --> 01:26:26,096
And these boys here,

1300
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:29,474
they trampled all over our venerated
observances and rituals.

1302
01:26:29,642 --> 01:26:33,145
Now, this here music is over, all right?

1303
01:26:33,313 --> 01:26:34,938
And I have... No! Hey!

1304
01:26:35,106 --> 01:26:37,733
Hey, I ain't... listen to me.

1305
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:39,985
Folks, listen to me. I...

1306
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:43,363
These boys desecrated a fiery cross.

1307
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:46,909
<i>We was all havin' a good time!</i>

1308
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:48,535
And they's convicts, folks.

1309
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:51,163
Fugitives escaped off the farm.

1310
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:55,250
Now, folks, these boys got to be
remanded to the authorities.

1312
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:56,460
Criminals!

1313
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:59,379
And I have it from the highest authority

1314
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:02,674
that that Negro sold his soul to the devil!

1316
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:05,761
Wait, wait, wait a minute, now, folks.

1317
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:07,804
No! It's true!

1318
01:27:07,972 --> 01:27:09,932
It's true.

1319
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:11,350
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, folks.

1320
01:27:11,517 --> 01:27:14,728
Is you is, or is you ain't my constituency?

1321
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:15,938
<b>No!</b>

1322
01:27:16,105 --> 01:27:17,439
Is you is, <i>or is you ain't</i>

1323
01:27:17,607 --> 01:27:18,732
<i>my constituency?</i>

1324
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:21,068
<i><b>No!</i></b>

1325
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:23,904
Is you is...

1326
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,990
Is you is, or is you ain't

1327
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:28,533
my constituency?

1328
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:31,203
Oh, come on, folks.

1329
01:27:31,371 --> 01:27:32,955
No. It's Homer now.

1330
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:35,290
Come on. I'm a friend of the little man.

1332
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:48,178
This is not fair!

1333
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:49,930
Hey! Come on!

1334
01:27:53,059 --> 01:27:53,934
Come on, now, folks.

1335
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,727
We got a little misunderstanding here.

1336
01:27:55,895 --> 01:27:57,187
Goddamn!

1270
01:28:03,800 --> 01:28:08,100
# It's fair to tell #

1271
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:11,000
# My only lover #

1272
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:13,700
# I never expect #

1273
01:28:13,800 --> 01:28:15,900
# To see you again #

1274
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:22,000
# For I'm bound to ride #

1275
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:24,800
# That northern railroad #

1276
01:28:24,900 --> 01:28:29,900
# Perhaps I'll die upon that train #

1277
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:35,500
# Perhaps he'll die upon this train #

1337
01:28:35,893 --> 01:28:38,228
Goddamn! Opportunity knocks.

1338
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:42,024
Get out of my way!

1280
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:44,500
# I'm just a stranger #

1281
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:48,000
# In case you ever #

1282
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,900
# See your man #

1283
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:56,500
# But there is one promise #

1284
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,000
# That is given #

1285
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,800
# I'll meet you on #

1286
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:04,500
# God's golden shore #

1287
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:07,600
# He'll meet you on #

1288
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,000
# God's golden shore #

1339
01:29:10,219 --> 01:29:11,386
That's fine.

1340
01:29:11,554 --> 01:29:12,554
That's fine!

1341
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:19,436
Ladies and gentlemens,

1342
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:22,022
here and listening at home,

1343
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,400
the great state of Mississippi

1344
01:29:25,568 --> 01:29:27,569
Pappy O'Daniel, governor

1345
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:29,988
wants to thank the Soggy Bottom Boys

1346
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:32,032
for that wonderful performance!

1347
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:38,205
And it looks like

1348
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:40,415
the only man in this great state,

1349
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:42,125
who ain't a music lover,

1350
01:29:42,293 --> 01:29:44,753
is my esteemed opponent in the upcoming,

1351
01:29:44,921 --> 01:29:47,005
Homer Stokes.

1352
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:48,799
Yeah, well, there ain't
no accounting for taste.

1353
01:29:50,301 --> 01:29:51,802
He sounded to me like he was harboring

1354
01:29:51,969 --> 01:29:53,470
some kind of hateful grudge

1355
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:55,347
against the Soggy Bottom Boys

1356
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:58,100
on account of their rough and rowdy past.

1357
01:29:59,268 --> 01:30:00,102
Looks like...

1358
01:30:00,269 --> 01:30:01,603
Looks like...

1359
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:05,273
Homer Stokes is the kind of fellow
wants to cast the first stone.

1361
01:30:06,692 --> 01:30:08,777
Well, I'm with you, folks.

1362
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:11,113
I'm a forgive and forget Christian.

1363
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:14,783
And I say if their rambunctiousness

1364
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:18,036
and misdemeanoring is behind them...

1365
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:19,371
It is, ain't it, boys?

1366
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:21,289
Yes, sir, it is.

1367
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:23,417
Well, then, I say,

1368
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:26,002
by the power vested in me

1369
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:29,089
these boys is hereby pardoned.

1370
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:34,553
And furthermore...

1371
01:30:35,888 --> 01:30:38,807
In the second Pappy O'Daniel administration,

1372
01:30:38,975 --> 01:30:42,310
these boys is going to be in my brain trust.

1373
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:48,650
What's that mean, Everett?

1374
01:30:48,818 --> 01:30:51,403
Well, Delmar, it means that you and me

1375
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:52,946
and Pete and Tommy are going to be

1376
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,449
the power behind the throne, so to speak.

1377
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:58,243
Oh, okay.

1378
01:30:58,411 --> 01:31:00,162
So, without further ado,

1379
01:31:00,329 --> 01:31:03,206
and by way of endorsing my candidacy,

1380
01:31:03,374 --> 01:31:05,000
the Soggy Bottom Boys

1381
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:06,835
is going to lead us all in a chorus of

1382
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:09,379
"You Are My Sunshine."

1383
01:31:10,673 --> 01:31:11,840
Ain't you, boys?

1384
01:31:13,301 --> 01:31:14,718
Governor, it's one of our favorites.

1385
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,678
Son...

1386
01:31:16,846 --> 01:31:19,473
You're gonna go far.

1325
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,700
# You are my sunshine #

1326
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,300
# My only sunshine #

1327
01:31:25,400 --> 01:31:28,000
# You make me happy #

1328
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,500
# When skies are grey #

1329
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,200
# You'll never know, dear #

1330
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:36,000
# How much I love you #

1331
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:37,600
# Please don't take #

1332
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,400
# My sunshine away #

1387
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:48,376
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip
is gonna be going on relief.

1389
01:31:48,544 --> 01:31:51,421
Maybe I can throw a little patronage his way.

1390
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:54,633
Get him a job digging ditches
or rounding up stray dogs.

1392
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:57,219
So, is the marriage off, then, Miss Wharvey?

1393
01:31:57,386 --> 01:31:58,512
It's McGill.

1394
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:01,223
No. The marriage will take place as planned.

1395
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:03,308
With a little change of cast.

1396
01:32:03,476 --> 01:32:05,644
Me and the little lady are gonna
pick up the pieces

1397
01:32:05,811 --> 01:32:08,980
and retie the knot, mixaphorically speaking.

1398
01:32:09,148 --> 01:32:11,566
You boys are invited, of course.

1399
01:32:11,734 --> 01:32:13,527
Hell, you're the best men.

1400
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:14,986
I already got the rings.

1401
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:17,239
Where's your ring, honey?

1402
01:32:17,406 --> 01:32:19,908
I ain't worn it since our divorce came through.

1403
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:22,077
It must still be in the roll-top in the old cabin.

1404
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:23,620
Never thought I'd need it.

1405
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,830
Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels.

1406
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:28,250
Now's the time to buy it off him cheap.

1407
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:31,419
We ain't getting married with his ring.

1408
01:32:31,587 --> 01:32:33,255
You said you'd changed.

1409
01:32:33,422 --> 01:32:34,756
Honey, it's just an old pewter thing.

1410
01:32:34,924 --> 01:32:35,924
Ain't going to be no wedding.

1411
01:32:36,092 --> 01:32:37,717
It's just a symbol, honey.

1412
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:38,718
No wedding.

1413
01:32:38,886 --> 01:32:40,428
We'll go fetch it with you, Everett.

1414
01:32:40,596 --> 01:32:42,222
It's just a... Shut up, Delmar!

1415
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,431
It's just a symbol.

1416
01:32:43,599 --> 01:32:47,185
I've spoken my piece and counted to 3.

1417
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:48,520
She counted to 3.

1418
01:32:48,688 --> 01:32:51,273
Goddamn it.

1419
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,983
She counted to 3.

1420
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,401
Son of a bitch!

1421
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,112
You have any idea how far that cabin is?

1422
01:33:13,921 --> 01:33:15,255
George?

1423
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:17,173
Hello, boys!

1424
01:33:17,341 --> 01:33:21,595
Well, these little men finally caught up
with the criminal of the century.

1426
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:23,972
Looks like the chair for George Nelson.

1427
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:26,891
Yup, gonna electrify me.

1428
01:33:27,059 --> 01:33:29,561
I'm gonna go off like a Roman candle.

1430
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:32,188
20,000 volts

1431
01:33:32,356 --> 01:33:34,441
chasing a rabbit through yours truly.

1432
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:35,817
God damn!

1433
01:33:35,985 --> 01:33:38,445
Gonna suck all the power
right out of the state!

1434
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:41,114
Gonna shoot sparks
out the top of my head

1435
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:43,283
and lightning from my fingertips!

1436
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:45,118
I'm George Nelson

1437
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,912
and I'm feeling 10 feet tall!

1438
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:51,708
Looks like George
is right back on top again.

1439
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:54,461
Cow killer!

1440
01:34:07,516 --> 01:34:11,519
Well, at least you boys get
to see the ancestral manse.

1442
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:14,064
The home where I spent
so many a happy day

1443
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:16,149
in the bosom of my family,

1444
01:34:16,317 --> 01:34:17,859
refugin', if you will,

1445
01:34:18,027 --> 01:34:19,653
with a mighty oak tree out front

1446
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:22,739
and a happy little tire swing on it.

1447
01:34:27,703 --> 01:34:31,164
Where's the happy little tire swing?

1448
01:34:33,250 --> 01:34:36,419
End of the road, boys.

1449
01:34:36,587 --> 01:34:37,545
No. Wait a minute.

1450
01:34:37,713 --> 01:34:38,755
Let's go, boys.

1451
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:40,298
- It's had its twists and turns.
- Wait a minute now/

1452
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:43,510
Now it deposits you here.

1453
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:44,928
Wait a minute.

1454
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:46,554
You have eluded fate

1455
01:34:46,622 --> 01:34:48,473
and you have eluded me

1456
01:34:48,541 --> 01:34:50,725
for the last time.

1457
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:52,394
Tie their hands, boys.

1458
01:34:52,561 --> 01:34:53,895
You can't do this, now.

1459
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:56,940
Didn't know you'd be bringing a friend.

1460
01:34:57,108 --> 01:34:59,109
He'll just have to wait his turn,

1461
01:34:59,276 --> 01:35:01,236
share one of your graves.

1462
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:02,529
You can't do this.

1463
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:04,906
We just got pardoned
by the governor hisself.

1464
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:06,700
It went out on the radio.

1465
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:09,160
Is that right?

1466
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:14,499
Well, we ain't got a radio.

1467
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:18,837
God have mercy.

1385
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:27,000
# You #

1386
01:35:27,300 --> 01:35:29,200
# Got to go #

1387
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:32,600
# To that lonesome valley #

1468
01:35:42,528 --> 01:35:44,154
It ain't fittin'.

1469
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:45,655
It ain't the law.

1470
01:35:45,823 --> 01:35:47,407
The law?

1471
01:35:49,326 --> 01:35:52,537
The law is a human institution.

1394
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:56,400
# Nobody else #

1395
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,500
# Can go there for you, no #

1472
01:35:59,587 --> 01:36:02,589
Perhaps you should start
making your prayers.

1398
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:14,300
# Got #

1399
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,300
# To go #

1473
01:36:16,353 --> 01:36:18,062
Oh, my God.

1474
01:36:18,230 --> 01:36:19,105
Everett?

1475
01:36:20,941 --> 01:36:24,527
Tommy, I'm sorry we got you into this.

1476
01:36:24,695 --> 01:36:26,905
Good Lord...

1477
01:36:27,072 --> 01:36:28,531
what do we do?

1403
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:31,900
# By #

1403
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,900
# Yourself #

1478
01:36:38,501 --> 01:36:41,461
Oh, Lord...

1479
01:36:41,629 --> 01:36:44,964
please look down and
recognize us poor sinners.

1481
01:36:48,093 --> 01:36:50,220
Please, Lord.

1482
01:36:50,387 --> 01:36:53,349
I just want to see my daughters again.

1483
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:58,686
I've been separated from my family
for so long.

1484
01:36:58,854 --> 01:37:02,065
I know I've been guilty of
pride and sharp dealing.

1486
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:04,526
I'm sorry that I turned my back on you.

1487
01:37:04,693 --> 01:37:07,654
Forgive me.

1488
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:10,740
We're helpless, Lord.

1489
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,534
For the sake of my family.

1490
01:37:12,701 --> 01:37:14,536
For Tommy's sake.

1491
01:37:14,703 --> 01:37:16,746
For Delmar's and Pete's.

1492
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,043
Let me see my daughters again, Lord.

1493
01:37:24,046 --> 01:37:26,798
Help us, please.

1418
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:47,200
# You got to go #

1419
01:37:47,200 --> 01:37:50,700
# To the lonesome valley #

1420
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:59,600
# Yes, sir! #
# You, whoa #

1421
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:05,500
# Got #

1422
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:10,300
# To go #

1423
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:13,200
# There #

1424
01:38:13,300 --> 01:38:15,300
# Hey #

1425
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:21,000
# By #

1426
01:38:21,100 --> 01:38:22,800
# Yourself #

1427
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:26,200
# Nobody else #
# Nobody else #

1428
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:29,900
# Nobody else can go for you #

1429
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:39,000
# You, whoa #

1430
01:38:39,100 --> 01:38:46,000
# Got #

1431
01:38:46,100 --> 01:38:49,900
# To go #

1432
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,200
# There #

1433
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:56,500
# Ohh #

1434
01:38:56,600 --> 01:39:01,100
# By #

1435
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:04,500
# Yourself #

1495
01:39:41,850 --> 01:39:43,643
A miracle.

1496
01:39:43,811 --> 01:39:45,019
It was a miracle!

1497
01:39:45,187 --> 01:39:46,646
Delmar, don't be ignorant.

1498
01:39:46,814 --> 01:39:48,272
I told you they was flooding this valley.

1499
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:49,941
No! That ain't it!

1500
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:52,026
We prayed to God and he pitied us!

1501
01:39:52,194 --> 01:39:53,695
Well, it never fails.

1502
01:39:53,862 --> 01:39:57,573
Once again, you two hayseeds are showin'
how much you want for intellect.

1504
01:39:57,741 --> 01:39:40:00,201
There's a perfectly scientific explanation
for what just happened.

1506
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:04,038
That ain't the tune you was singin'
back there at the gallows!

1508
01:40:04,206 --> 01:40:07,291
Well, any human being will cast about
in a moment of stress.

1510
01:40:07,459 --> 01:40:10,253
No, the fact is, they're flooding this valley,

1511
01:40:10,421 --> 01:40:12,505
so they can hydroelectric up
the whole durn state.

1512
01:40:12,673 --> 01:40:16,134
Yes, sir, the South is gonna change.

1513
01:40:16,301 --> 01:40:19,679
Everything's gonna be put on electricity
and run on a paying basis.

1515
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:21,389
Out with the old spiritual mumbo jumbo,

1516
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,766
the superstitions, and the backward ways.

1517
01:40:23,934 --> 01:40:25,727
We're gonna see a brave new world,

1518
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:27,729
where they run everybody a wire

1519
01:40:27,896 --> 01:40:29,230
and hook us all up to a grid.

1520
01:40:29,398 --> 01:40:31,774
Yes, sir, a veritable age of reason.

1521
01:40:31,942 --> 01:40:33,317
Like the one they had in France.

1522
01:40:33,485 --> 01:40:35,486
Not a moment too soon.

1523
01:40:40,117 --> 01:40:43,202
Not a moment too soon.

1524
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:46,080
Hey, there's Tommy.

1525
01:40:46,248 --> 01:40:48,166
Tommy, what you ridin' there?

1527
01:40:52,504 --> 01:40:54,422
Roll-top desk.

1459
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:59,500
# My latest sun is sinking fast #

1460
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:03,700
# My race is nearly run #

1528
01:41:03,807 --> 01:41:06,517
"All's well that ends well", some poet said.

1529
01:41:06,685 --> 01:41:08,186
That's right, honey.

1530
01:41:08,353 --> 01:41:10,313
Don't mind telling you I'm awful pleased

1531
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:13,941
my adventuring days have come to an end.

1532
01:41:14,109 --> 01:41:16,611
Time for this old boy to enjoy some repose.

1533
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:18,279
That's good, honey.

1534
01:41:18,447 --> 01:41:20,531
You were right about that ring, too.

1535
01:41:20,699 --> 01:41:23,993
Any other wedding band wouldn't do.

1536
01:41:24,161 --> 01:41:25,703
This here was fore-ordained.

1537
01:41:25,871 --> 01:41:27,705
Fate was a-smilin' on me.
You just have to have confidence.

1538
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:29,624
- That's not my ring.
- What?

1539
01:41:29,792 --> 01:41:31,918
- That's not my ring.
- Not your ring?

1540
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:33,669
That's one of Aunt Hurlene's.

1541
01:41:33,837 --> 01:41:35,171
You said it was in the roll-top desk.

1542
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:36,756
I said I thought it was in the roll-top desk.

1543
01:41:36,924 --> 01:41:37,799
No, you said--

1544
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:39,383
- Or under the mattress.
- No.

1545
01:41:39,551 --> 01:41:41,469
Or maybe in my chifforobe. I don't know.

1546
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:44,347
Well, I'm sorry, honey.

1547
01:41:44,515 --> 01:41:45,973
We need that ring.

1548
01:41:46,141 --> 01:41:48,684
That ring is at the bottom
of a pretty durn big lake.

1549
01:41:48,852 --> 01:41:49,977
Uh-uh.

1550
01:41:50,145 --> 01:41:51,479
A 9,000-hectare lake.

1551
01:41:51,647 --> 01:41:53,981
I don't care if it's 90,000.
That lake was not my doing.

1552
01:41:54,149 --> 01:41:55,233
Of course not, honey--

1553
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:56,651
I counted to 3, honey.

1554
01:41:56,819 --> 01:41:58,152
No, wait, honey.

1555
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,780
Finding one little ring
in the middle of all that water

1556
01:42:00,848 --> 01:42:02,907
is one hell of a heroic task!

1483
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:08,200
# And gives me victory #

1484
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:13,800

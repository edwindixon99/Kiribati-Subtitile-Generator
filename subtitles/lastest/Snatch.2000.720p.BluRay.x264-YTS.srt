1
00:00:37,525 --> 00:00:39,234
My name is Turkish.

2
00:00:39,527 --> 00:00:41,612
Funny name for an Englishman,
I know.

3
00:00:41,863 --> 00:00:46,241
My parents were on the same plane
when it crashed. That's how they met.

4
00:00:46,701 --> 00:00:48,869
They named me after the plane.

5
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,664
Not many people are
named after a plane crash.

6
00:00:52,248 --> 00:00:53,874
That's Tommy.

7
00:00:54,084 --> 00:00:56,293
He tells people
he was named after a gun.

8
00:00:56,503 --> 00:01:01,215
But I know he was really named after
a famous 19th-century ballet dancer.

9
00:01:01,424 --> 00:01:04,843
Known him for as long as I can
remember. He's my partner.

10
00:01:05,053 --> 00:01:07,513
Doesn't mean we hold hands
or take walks.

11
00:01:07,722 --> 00:01:12,643
It means I try to keep him out of
as much trouble as he inflicts on me.

12
00:01:12,978 --> 00:01:15,854
I give him a hard time.
Keeps him in check.

13
00:01:16,064 --> 00:01:19,149
But really, he's like my brother.

14
00:01:19,734 --> 00:01:22,903
What do I know about diamonds?
I'm a boxing promoter.

15
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:27,032
I was a happy boxing promoter
until a week ago, and then:

16
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:29,868
What do I know about diamonds?

17
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:32,204
Don't they come from Antwerp?

18
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:36,417
- Himy, would you listen to this?
- Do we have a choice?

19
00:01:38,044 --> 00:01:40,129
It wasn't meant to be taken
literally.

20
00:01:40,338 --> 00:01:42,840
It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.

21
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:45,426
It's bound with moral fiber...

22
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:49,263
...but asking a grown man
to believe it?

23
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:52,349
What is it?

24
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:56,103
Well, what is it?

25
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,733
What you want I should do,
drop my pants?

26
00:02:00,942 --> 00:02:02,693
Okay, go through.

27
00:02:04,029 --> 00:02:06,155
It's a nice story.

28
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:09,783
It's just that. Just a story.

29
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:13,495
Catholic religion is based
on a mistranslation.

30
00:02:13,705 --> 00:02:15,998
Enough already.
Ruben, say something.

31
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:19,001
Listen. Are you busy?
I'll tell you the whole story.

32
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,464
The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
the Hebrew word for "young woman"...

33
00:02:23,715 --> 00:02:25,883
...into the Greek word for "virgin. "

34
00:02:26,134 --> 00:02:28,552
It was an easy mistake to make...

35
00:02:28,803 --> 00:02:33,348
...because there was only a subtle
difference in the spelling.

36
00:02:43,485 --> 00:02:45,694
So, they came up with a prophecy:

37
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:50,115
"Behold, the virgin shall conceive
and bear us a son. "

38
00:02:50,325 --> 00:02:54,495
You understand? It was "virgin"
that caught people's attention.

39
00:02:54,662 --> 00:02:58,874
It's not every day a virgin conceives
and bears a son.

40
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:19,228
But leave that for a couple
of hundred years to stew...

41
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:23,023
...and next thing you know you have
the Holy Catholic Church.

42
00:03:23,274 --> 00:03:26,443
Oy vay, what are you saying?

43
00:03:26,694 --> 00:03:29,238
I'm saying, just because
it's written...

44
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:31,031
...doesn't make it so.

45
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:35,202
Gives them hope. It's not important
whether it's fact or fiction.

46
00:03:35,453 --> 00:03:37,913
- People like to believe.
- I don't want to hear any more.

47
00:03:38,123 --> 00:03:41,375
Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?

48
00:03:42,043 --> 00:03:43,710
- Michael.
- Hello?

49
00:03:45,421 --> 00:03:46,630
Mutti.

50
00:03:46,881 --> 00:03:50,592
Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

51
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:56,723
Rud, it's okay, let them through.

52
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,891
- Michael.
- Mutti.

53
00:03:58,393 --> 00:04:02,896
You kept us waiting for half an hour.
Are you trying to give me heartburn?

54
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,571
Lie down on the floor.

55
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:14,158
Get on the floor!

56
00:04:14,993 --> 00:04:16,702
Lie on the floor!

57
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,245
Get on the fucking floor!

58
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:21,748
- Get down!
- Get fucking down!

59
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:24,209
Down on the floor! Get down!

60
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:25,836
On the ground!

61
00:04:30,175 --> 00:04:31,842
Get down, I say!

62
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:34,136
- Time.
- Seven minutes!

63
00:04:38,474 --> 00:04:39,474
Where is the stone?

64
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:44,855
Where is the stone?

65
00:04:46,357 --> 00:04:49,026
Where is the stone?

66
00:04:54,574 --> 00:04:56,366
Michael, where is the stone?

67
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:24,121
When does your plane leave?

68
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:26,373
Twenty minutes.

69
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,709
Give me your gun.

70
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:42,222
When you get to London...

71
00:06:42,473 --> 00:06:44,349
...if you want a gun...

72
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:46,393
...call this number.

73
00:06:50,898 --> 00:06:53,191
- Boris.
- Boris.

74
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:56,695
He can get you anything you need.

75
00:07:03,828 --> 00:07:05,746
Is he allowed to do that?

76
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,250
It's an unlicensed boxing match.
It's not a tickling competition.

77
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,544
These lads are out
to hurt each other.

78
00:07:13,504 --> 00:07:15,422
What's with those sausages,
Charlie?

79
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,007
Two minutes, Turkish.

80
00:07:18,676 --> 00:07:22,471
Look at it. How am I supposed
to run this thing from that?

81
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,181
We'll need a proper office.

82
00:07:24,432 --> 00:07:27,392
I want a new one.
You're going to buy it for me.

83
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:29,227
Why me?

84
00:07:29,937 --> 00:07:31,855
Well, you know about caravans.

85
00:07:32,065 --> 00:07:33,523
How's that?

86
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:37,235
You spent a summer in one.
Which means you know more than me.

87
00:07:37,445 --> 00:07:40,781
And I don't wanna have me pants
pulled down over the price.

88
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:42,282
What's wrong with this one?

89
00:07:43,993 --> 00:07:45,827
Oh, nothing, Tommy.

90
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:47,913
It's tiptop.

91
00:07:48,122 --> 00:07:49,956
I'm just not sure about the color.

92
00:07:52,001 --> 00:07:54,336
It's all arranged.
You just got to pick it up.

93
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,380
Here's an address.

94
00:07:58,049 --> 00:07:59,549
It's a campsite.

95
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:04,137
You've got 10 grand, and
it would be nice to see change.

96
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:08,100
- What's happening with the sausages?
- Five minutes.

97
00:08:10,353 --> 00:08:12,938
It was two minutes five minutes ago.

98
00:08:13,147 --> 00:08:14,773
They ain't pikeys, are they?

99
00:08:15,066 --> 00:08:17,776
I fucking hate pikeys.

100
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:20,612
You're a sensitive boy, Tommy.

101
00:08:23,366 --> 00:08:25,409
Fuck me. Hold tight.

102
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,495
- What's that?
- It's me belt.

103
00:08:28,746 --> 00:08:31,081
No, Tommy. There's a gun
in your trousers.

104
00:08:31,332 --> 00:08:34,501
- What's a gun doing in your trousers?
- It's for protection.

105
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:35,919
Protection from what?

106
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,004
"Zee" Germans?

107
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:41,425
What's to stop it blowing your
bollocks off when you sit?

108
00:08:41,676 --> 00:08:44,886
- Where did you get it?
- Boris The Blade.

109
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:47,639
You mean Boris the sneaky
fucking Russian.

110
00:08:48,433 --> 00:08:49,891
Heavy, isn't it?

111
00:08:51,686 --> 00:08:52,686
Heavy is good.

112
00:08:54,063 --> 00:08:55,272
Heavy is reliable.

113
00:08:55,481 --> 00:08:58,150
If it doesn't work,
you can always hit him with it.

114
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:01,486
Boris The Blade,
or Boris The Bullet-Dodger.

115
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:05,073
Bent as the Soviet sickle and
hard as the hammer that crosses it.

116
00:09:05,241 --> 00:09:09,995
Apparently, it's just impossible
to kill the bastard.

117
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:13,290
Back to my partner, Tommy.

118
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,167
Tommy runs the other business...

119
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:17,252
...the slot machines...

120
00:09:17,462 --> 00:09:21,047
...which keeps rain off our heads
and gloves on Gorgeous' hands.

121
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:25,719
However, Tommy's a little preoccupied
with protection at present.

122
00:09:26,596 --> 00:09:28,096
All right, I'll take it.

123
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,267
There's a reason for Tommy's
newfound enthusiasm for firearms.

124
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,063
Sooner or later, in unlicensed boxing,
you have to deal with that reason:

125
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:38,482
Brick Top.

126
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:41,401
If that's not worth a bet,
I don't know what is.

127
00:09:41,569 --> 00:09:44,738
- He doesn't look bad, does he?
- No, he looks great.

128
00:09:44,989 --> 00:09:46,364
He'll do you proud.

129
00:09:46,574 --> 00:09:50,744
You reckon that's what people should
do for me, Gary? Do me proud?

130
00:09:50,912 --> 00:09:51,995
It's what you deserve.

131
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:54,623
Pull your tongue out of my arsehole.

132
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:56,917
Dogs do that.

133
00:09:57,627 --> 00:09:59,419
You're not a dog, are you?

134
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,087
No. No, I'm not.

135
00:10:01,464 --> 00:10:02,756
However...

136
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:07,260
...you do have all the characteristics
of a dog, Gary.

137
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,762
All except loyalty.

138
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:13,433
It's rumored that his favorite means
of dispatch involves a stun gun...

139
00:10:13,643 --> 00:10:17,812
...a plastic bag, a roll of tape
and a pack of hungry pigs.

140
00:10:18,773 --> 00:10:22,442
You're a ruthless little cunt, Liam.
I'll give you that.

141
00:10:24,654 --> 00:10:27,447
But I got no time for grouses.

142
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:31,618
Feed him to the pigs, Errol.

143
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,330
What the fuck are you two looking at?

144
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:42,629
If you got to deal with him, just make
sure you don't end up owing him.

145
00:10:42,797 --> 00:10:44,047
Then you're in his debt.

146
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,508
Which means, you're in his pocket.

147
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:50,136
And once you're in that,
you ain't ever coming out.

148
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:53,890
I hear he's a good fighter,
so I'll use him.

149
00:10:54,141 --> 00:10:56,351
I'll be doing you a favor, boy.

150
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:59,604
What he means is,
I'm doing him a favor.

151
00:10:59,772 --> 00:11:04,859
Because everybody knows nobody
takes a dive in my fights. Unlike his.

152
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,779
Here, Errol, I don't think
he likes me.

153
00:11:08,531 --> 00:11:09,864
You don't like me, do you?

154
00:11:10,074 --> 00:11:11,324
Don't know what you mean.

155
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:14,786
I do know I can't wait to get
out of here. It stinks.

156
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:20,250
My fights finish prompt so we can get
out before the authorities find out.

157
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:22,711
Play your cards right
and I'll sort you out.

158
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:25,505
You can sort me out
by showing me out.

159
00:11:25,715 --> 00:11:28,550
It's hard to make a living
in boxing, so now and then...

160
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,344
...you do something
against your principles.

161
00:11:31,596 --> 00:11:34,598
Basically, you have to forget
you got any.

162
00:11:34,807 --> 00:11:36,266
Are they Lancashire pigs?

163
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:38,059
Who's talking to you?

164
00:11:38,561 --> 00:11:41,688
Oh, yeah, Tommy.
Brick Top loves Tommy.

165
00:11:42,982 --> 00:11:44,107
Don't let me down.

166
00:11:45,318 --> 00:11:47,694
You don't want to
let me down, do you?

167
00:11:49,864 --> 00:11:51,865
See you ringside.

168
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:58,705
Boris, Franky-fucking-Four Fingers...

169
00:11:58,956 --> 00:12:01,583
...has a diamond the size of a fist.

170
00:12:01,876 --> 00:12:05,462
I have told you it's in the briefcase
connected to his arm.

171
00:12:05,671 --> 00:12:07,922
I sent him to you to buy a gun.

172
00:12:08,132 --> 00:12:10,967
What more do you want me to do,
hit him for you?

173
00:12:11,218 --> 00:12:13,595
But don't you hit him either.

174
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:16,931
Americans can't know
it was Russian.

175
00:12:17,183 --> 00:12:18,850
It will come back to me.

176
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,852
So, what should I do?

177
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:23,021
You're my brother, so think like it.

178
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,317
Get somebody else
to steal that stone!

179
00:12:27,526 --> 00:12:29,653
I don't want it getting back to me.

180
00:12:29,945 --> 00:12:32,781
And don't have him killed.
It will raise suspicion.

181
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,783
So don't use idiots for the job.

182
00:12:35,034 --> 00:12:38,662
He'll stay in London a couple of
days before he goes to New York...

183
00:12:38,871 --> 00:12:41,331
...so move quick. Okay?

184
00:12:41,707 --> 00:12:44,793
It's okay.
I know a couple of guys.

185
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:46,628
One more thing.

186
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,421
It might help.

187
00:12:48,964 --> 00:12:50,590
He loves to gamble.

188
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,135
Eighty-six karats?

189
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:56,346
Brilliant cut, beautiful make.

190
00:12:58,057 --> 00:12:59,599
A beautiful stone.

191
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,892
You're a good boy, Franky.

192
00:13:01,102 --> 00:13:04,229
And you did a real good job.
Now when do you get back?

193
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:09,275
I got to move the two-grainers here,
get a better price. Couple of days.

194
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:12,112
- Talk to my cousin Dougie.
- Doug The Head?

195
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:16,866
And Franky...

196
00:13:17,493 --> 00:13:19,619
- And what?
- Stay out of those casinos.

197
00:13:22,957 --> 00:13:24,666
You did a good job, bubbe.

198
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,961
- Don't go screwing it up, all right?
- I hear you, Avi.

199
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:30,588
I'll see you, Avi.

200
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:35,093
Eighty-six karats.

201
00:13:35,302 --> 00:13:37,011
- Where?
- London.

202
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:38,847
- London?
- London.

203
00:13:39,056 --> 00:13:41,057
- London?
- Yes, London.

204
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:44,644
You know, fish, chips, cup of tea...

205
00:13:44,895 --> 00:13:48,064
...bad food, worse weather,
Mary-fucking-Poppins. London!

206
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:51,067
Not for me.

207
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,446
That's Doug The Head.
Everybody knows Doug The Head.

208
00:13:54,739 --> 00:13:57,449
If it's stones and it's stolen,
he's the man to speak to.

209
00:13:57,616 --> 00:14:00,618
Pretends he's Jewish.
Wishes he was Jewish.

210
00:14:00,828 --> 00:14:03,079
Even tells his family
they're Jewish...

211
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:06,583
...but he's about as Jewish
as he is a fucking monkey.

212
00:14:06,834 --> 00:14:10,795
He thinks it's good for business.
And in the diamond business...

213
00:14:11,005 --> 00:14:13,423
- ... it is good for business.
- Avi!

214
00:14:13,632 --> 00:14:15,675
He'll be there today.
Take care of him.

215
00:14:15,843 --> 00:14:18,636
Avi, you know I won't buy schtrops.

216
00:14:18,846 --> 00:14:21,473
He isn't selling schtrops.
Make it smaller.

217
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,850
Who do you take me for?
This is England.

218
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:25,894
We play by the rules.

219
00:14:26,187 --> 00:14:27,479
Listen to me.

220
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,024
If the stones are kosher,
then I'll buy them, won't I?

221
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:35,195
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's my lunchtime. Bye.

222
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:42,660
What are you doing here?

223
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,788
It's a free country, isn't it?

224
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:47,874
Well, it ain't a free shop, is it?

225
00:14:48,125 --> 00:14:50,001
So fuck off.

226
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:03,264
I want to see you two girls
up in my office.

227
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,642
I had cousin Avi on the phone.

228
00:15:05,851 --> 00:15:08,603
- You got to go see him.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.

229
00:15:08,854 --> 00:15:12,190
- He's a big mucker in New York.
- Yeah, Dad. You told us.

230
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,901
I want to see you girls
up in my office.

231
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,612
Yeah, Dad. You told us.

232
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:25,703
The weight is sign of reliability.

233
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:28,540
I always go for reliability.

234
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:38,383
I'll take it.

235
00:15:38,801 --> 00:15:40,218
How much do you want for it?

236
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:41,636
Nothing.

237
00:15:43,264 --> 00:15:46,474
Okay, so what do you want for it?

238
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:48,309
I want you to do something for me.

239
00:15:50,354 --> 00:15:52,230
There is a fight in couple of days.

240
00:15:53,607 --> 00:15:55,024
What kind of a fight?

241
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,943
Unlicensed boxing.

242
00:15:58,445 --> 00:16:01,322
There is a bookies I know
that will take bets.

243
00:16:04,326 --> 00:16:06,119
If you place one down for me...

244
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:08,246
...we will call it quits.

245
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:10,790
- Why don't you put it down yourself?
- Well...

246
00:16:12,376 --> 00:16:16,462
...there is not too many bookies
that takes those kind of bets.

247
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:20,842
And I already have an outstanding
debt with the house.

248
00:16:23,012 --> 00:16:25,638
I know something most don't.

249
00:16:26,432 --> 00:16:27,974
So, nu?

250
00:16:29,143 --> 00:16:30,685
What do you know?

251
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:38,192
It's a campsite. A pikey campsite.

252
00:16:38,402 --> 00:16:41,446
- Ten points.
- What are we doing here?

253
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:45,533
- We're buying a caravan.
- Off a pack of fucking pikeys?

254
00:16:45,743 --> 00:16:48,453
What's wrong with you?
This will get messy.

255
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:49,746
Not if you're here.

256
00:16:49,955 --> 00:16:51,789
Oh, you bastard.

257
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:54,584
I fucking hate pikeys.

258
00:16:57,588 --> 00:16:59,047
That's a flash car, mister.

259
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:00,715
Not as flash as your bike.

260
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:02,884
Who are you looking for?

261
00:17:03,093 --> 00:17:04,427
Mr. O'Neil.

262
00:17:05,137 --> 00:17:07,347
- Want me to get him?
- That's a good lad.

263
00:17:07,598 --> 00:17:09,349
Piss off.

264
00:17:10,267 --> 00:17:12,894
- Are you going to go get him for me?
- Yeah.

265
00:17:13,854 --> 00:17:16,940
- What are you waiting for?
- The five quid you'll pay me.

266
00:17:17,149 --> 00:17:18,775
Fuck off, I'll find him meself.

267
00:17:18,984 --> 00:17:21,361
- Two fifty.
- You can have a quid.

268
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:23,196
You're a real tight fucker.

269
00:17:23,364 --> 00:17:25,281
There was a problem with gypsies.

270
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:27,408
What are you doing, Paulie?
Get out of the way, man.

271
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:29,494
You can't understand
what's being said.

272
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:31,287
You Tommy?
Come about the caravan?

273
00:17:31,538 --> 00:17:33,790
- Mr. O'Neil.
- Fuck, man. Call me Mickey.

274
00:17:33,999 --> 00:17:35,625
Not Irish, not English.

275
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:38,086
- How are you?
- Well, the weather's been kind to us,
but the horses, you know-

276
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:40,046
It's just Pikey.

277
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:42,423
Fuck me, would you look at the size of him?

278
00:17:43,008 --> 00:17:44,509
How big are you?

279
00:17:44,718 --> 00:17:46,678
- Kids, how big is he?
- Big, for sure.

280
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:49,639
Hey, Mam, come and look at the size
of this fella.

281
00:17:50,557 --> 00:17:55,103
Bet you box a little, can't you, sir?
You look like a boxer.

282
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,939
Get out of the way.
See if they'd like a drink.

283
00:17:58,148 --> 00:17:59,524
I could murder one.

284
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:02,777
Be no murdering done around here,
I don't mind telling you.

285
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:05,029
Get your hands out of there.

286
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,906
Cup of tea for the big fella?

287
00:18:07,074 --> 00:18:10,243
Don't be silly, Mickey.
Offer the man a proper drink.

288
00:18:11,829 --> 00:18:12,954
You little bugger.

289
00:18:13,163 --> 00:18:16,374
- Is the big fella not coming with us?
- He's minding the car.

290
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:20,420
- What does he think we are, thieves?
- No, nothing like that.

291
00:18:20,587 --> 00:18:23,756
- He just likes looking after cars.
- Good dags. Do you like dags?

292
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,800
- Dags?
- What?

293
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:27,719
- Yeah, dags.
- Dags. You like dags?

294
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,013
Oh, dogs.

295
00:18:30,222 --> 00:18:32,348
Sure, I like dags.

296
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,393
- I like caravans more.
- You're very welcome.

297
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:50,033
Pikeys are well-known for their
skills of negotiation in business.

298
00:18:50,284 --> 00:18:52,285
It's probably why
they talk like that...

299
00:18:52,536 --> 00:18:54,662
...so you can't follow
what's being said.

300
00:18:54,872 --> 00:18:58,374
But if Tommy can get the caravan
for less than the price asked...

301
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,960
...on his return
there will be ice cream.

302
00:19:01,211 --> 00:19:03,504
Good dog, good family.

303
00:19:03,714 --> 00:19:06,466
He'll get a little homesick,
but he'll get over it.

304
00:19:06,925 --> 00:19:09,594
See you later, lads. See you, boss.

305
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:12,013
All right, Mickey. Laters.

306
00:19:13,307 --> 00:19:14,974
I don't see what the fuss is about.

307
00:19:15,684 --> 00:19:16,976
They aren't bad fellas.

308
00:19:27,112 --> 00:19:29,405
The deal was, you bought it
how you saw it.

309
00:19:29,615 --> 00:19:32,742
Look, I've helped you as much
as I'm going to help you.

310
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,827
See that car? Use it.

311
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:38,706
You should fuck off now while
you still got the legs to carry you.

312
00:19:40,334 --> 00:19:41,918
Nobody brings you...

313
00:19:42,127 --> 00:19:45,046
...unless they're trying
to say something without talking.

314
00:19:46,006 --> 00:19:48,966
Just give our money back
and you can keep your caravan.

315
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:52,220
Why do I want a caravan
that's got no wheels?

316
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:55,598
- You want to settle this with a fight?
- Over my dead body.

317
00:19:55,849 --> 00:19:57,183
Now, go on! Go on!

318
00:19:57,434 --> 00:20:01,395
I'll not have you fighting! You know
what happens when you fight!

319
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,397
Get her to sit down.

320
00:20:04,108 --> 00:20:05,733
For fuck's sake!

321
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:13,658
Want the money?
I ain't fucked you.

322
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,452
I'll fight you for it. You and me.

323
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:31,801
So that's the kind of fight
it'll be.

324
00:20:32,344 --> 00:20:34,220
You want to stay down.

325
00:20:39,143 --> 00:20:40,685
You want to stay down!

326
00:20:43,814 --> 00:20:46,232
Get back down
and fucking stay down.

327
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:48,901
I promise you,
you want to stay down.

328
00:20:49,111 --> 00:20:51,237
Deadly kick for a fat fucker,
you know that?

329
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:53,489
Cheeky bastard.

330
00:21:00,497 --> 00:21:02,248
- Okay, lads.
- Get him on his feet.

331
00:21:03,709 --> 00:21:04,792
Get back down...

332
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:07,837
...or you will not be coming up
next time.

333
00:21:11,258 --> 00:21:12,258
Bollocks to you.

334
00:21:12,843 --> 00:21:14,719
This is sick. I'm out of here.

335
00:21:14,928 --> 00:21:17,471
You're not going anywhere,
you thick lump.

336
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:22,727
You stay until the job's done.

337
00:21:55,886 --> 00:21:59,472
It turned out that the sweet-talking,
tattoo-sporting pikey...

338
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,475
...was a gypsy bare-knuckle
boxing champion.

339
00:22:02,684 --> 00:22:05,436
Which makes him harder
than a coffin nail.

340
00:22:06,313 --> 00:22:09,982
Right now that's the last thing
on Tommy's mind.

341
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,902
If Gorgeous doesn't wake up
in the next few minutes...

342
00:22:13,153 --> 00:22:15,404
...Tommy knows he'll be buried
with him.

343
00:22:16,156 --> 00:22:18,699
Why would the gypsies
want to explain...

344
00:22:18,951 --> 00:22:21,160
...why a man died in their campsite?

345
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:24,580
Not when they can bury the pair
of them and just move camp.

346
00:22:24,873 --> 00:22:28,334
It's not like they got
social security numbers, is it?

347
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:30,920
Tommy, "The Tit"...

348
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:32,838
...is praying.

349
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:34,340
And if he isn't...

350
00:22:34,591 --> 00:22:36,634
...he fucking should be.

351
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:05,621
Bad Boy.

352
00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:07,873
- Sol.
- Easy.

353
00:23:08,166 --> 00:23:10,876
No, it's a moissanite.

354
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:12,044
A what?

355
00:23:12,629 --> 00:23:15,715
A moissanite is an artificial
diamond, Lincoln.

356
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:17,008
It's Mickey Mouse.

357
00:23:17,884 --> 00:23:19,010
Spurious.

358
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,220
Not genuine.

359
00:23:21,805 --> 00:23:23,389
And it's worth...

360
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,890
...fuck-all.

361
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:28,185
Bad Boy, I keep telling you,
stick to being a gangster.

362
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:30,229
Leave this game to me and Sol.

363
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,898
Laters.

364
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:37,820
What is that, Vince?

365
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,739
This is a dog, Sol.

366
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,199
You are not bringing
that thing in here.

367
00:23:42,409 --> 00:23:44,076
It's only a fucking dog.

368
00:23:44,328 --> 00:23:45,911
- Where'd you get it?
- The gyppos.

369
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,246
Here.

370
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:50,499
They threw it in with the moody gold.

371
00:23:51,585 --> 00:23:55,254
You know gyppos, Sol. They're always
throwing dogs in with deals.

372
00:23:55,422 --> 00:23:56,881
It better not be dangerous.

373
00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:00,885
What do you think you're doing now?

374
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:04,138
I want him to get used
to the shop, don't I?

375
00:24:06,308 --> 00:24:07,767
Stop the dog!

376
00:24:07,934 --> 00:24:09,185
Come back!

377
00:24:09,936 --> 00:24:11,270
All right, Boris?

378
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:15,274
- Don't worry about the dog.
- I'm not.

379
00:24:16,693 --> 00:24:18,152
What can I do for you?

380
00:24:19,071 --> 00:24:20,654
I have a job for you.

381
00:24:20,864 --> 00:24:22,615
I already have a job.

382
00:24:23,492 --> 00:24:26,327
Fifty grand for half a day's work.

383
00:24:27,621 --> 00:24:28,704
Go on.

384
00:24:28,914 --> 00:24:32,249
I want you to hold up a bookies.

385
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,798
From Russia with love, eh?

386
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:41,926
I have stones to sell...

387
00:24:42,135 --> 00:24:45,262
...fat to chew and many men
to see about many ducks...

388
00:24:45,472 --> 00:24:47,056
...so if I am not rushing you...

389
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:51,102
Slow down, Franky, my son.
When in Rome.

390
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,647
I am not in Rome, Doug.

391
00:24:54,856 --> 00:24:56,607
I am in a rush.

392
00:24:57,025 --> 00:24:58,484
I got to make the bookies.

393
00:24:58,652 --> 00:24:59,819
Bookies?

394
00:25:01,071 --> 00:25:03,155
- What are you betting on?
- Bomber Harris.

395
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:06,325
The unlicensed boxer?

396
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,080
Do you know something that I don't?

397
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:16,252
Bubbe, I probably know
a lot you don't.

398
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:20,172
He's bad to the bone,
ain't you, Tyrone?

399
00:25:20,382 --> 00:25:21,632
Of course I am.

400
00:25:21,842 --> 00:25:25,678
Tyrone will drive for us.
He's done a rally driving course.

401
00:25:25,887 --> 00:25:27,138
Of course I have.

402
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:32,726
I don't want that dog
dribbling on my seats.

403
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:34,478
Your seats?

404
00:25:34,688 --> 00:25:36,981
Tyrone, this is a stolen car, mate.

405
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:39,150
While I'm at the wheel, it's my car...

406
00:25:39,401 --> 00:25:43,779
...so stop that dog dribbling
on my seats. All right?

407
00:25:43,989 --> 00:25:46,907
I can't believe you found it.
Where'd it go?

408
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:48,868
It went back to the gyppos.

409
00:25:49,077 --> 00:25:51,829
Shut up.
And how could it find them?

410
00:25:52,122 --> 00:25:55,332
Well, I don't know.
I'm not a dog, Sol.

411
00:25:55,834 --> 00:25:57,209
Ask him.

412
00:25:58,253 --> 00:26:00,171
It's like he's
a fucking homing beacon.

413
00:26:02,007 --> 00:26:03,257
Steady on the brakes.

414
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:05,759
I thought you said
he could drive, Sol.

415
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:09,847
Don't worry about me. Just worry
about that dog on my seats.

416
00:26:10,056 --> 00:26:11,557
All right?

417
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:33,370
What?

418
00:26:33,872 --> 00:26:37,458
You said he was a getaway driver.
What the fuck can he get away from?

419
00:26:37,667 --> 00:26:40,544
Don't worry about Tyrone.
He can move when he has to.

420
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:42,338
Worry about getting us a gun.

421
00:26:47,594 --> 00:26:48,719
What's that?

422
00:26:49,638 --> 00:26:52,223
This is a shotgun, Sol.

423
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:55,267
It's a fucking
anti-aircraft gun, Vincent.

424
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,522
- I want to raise pulses, don't I?
- You'll raise hell, never mind pulses.

425
00:27:16,623 --> 00:27:20,209
That does not look like a bookies.

426
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,672
Why'd we stop here? What's the matter
with that space over there?

427
00:27:25,006 --> 00:27:26,840
It's too tight.

428
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:28,968
Too tight?

429
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:32,096
You could land a
jumbo-fucking-jet in there.

430
00:27:32,305 --> 00:27:36,559
Leave him alone.
He's a natural. Ain't you, Tyrone?

431
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,435
Of course I am.

432
00:27:49,531 --> 00:27:52,575
A natural fucking idiot.
Tyrone, what've you done?

433
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:54,910
Yeah, Tyrone, what have you done?

434
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:57,913
Look, you hassle me,
you see what happens.

435
00:27:58,164 --> 00:28:00,583
It's all right.
No, don't move it now.

436
00:28:00,792 --> 00:28:03,460
People'll see the damage.
Why'd you do that?

437
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,712
I didn't see it.

438
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:08,882
It's a four-ton truck. It's not like
it's a packet of fucking peanuts.

439
00:28:09,092 --> 00:28:10,801
It was at a funny angle.

440
00:28:13,305 --> 00:28:14,847
It's behind you, Tyrone.

441
00:28:15,056 --> 00:28:17,516
Whenever you reverse,
things come from behind you.

442
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:20,477
Control that dog as well.

443
00:28:21,187 --> 00:28:23,522
- Get that dog off him.
- Get it off me.

444
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:28,360
Give me that squeaky toy.
It shut him up last time.

445
00:28:32,198 --> 00:28:33,240
Don't snatch.

446
00:28:35,493 --> 00:28:37,119
He can't swallow the whole ball.

447
00:28:39,998 --> 00:28:41,165
Yeah.

448
00:28:44,169 --> 00:28:45,711
Why the fuck...

449
00:28:45,962 --> 00:28:48,339
...did you put Gorgeous George...

450
00:28:48,548 --> 00:28:51,216
...into a bare-knuckle boxing match...

451
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:53,761
...two days before
he had to fight The Bomber?

452
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,306
He was half his size.
I didn't expect him to get hurt.

453
00:28:57,557 --> 00:29:01,769
You put the man into
a bare-knuckle boxing match.

454
00:29:02,187 --> 00:29:04,396
What the fuck did you expect?

455
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,982
A grease-down and a shiatsu?

456
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:09,652
Who took the jam
out of your doughnut?

457
00:29:09,903 --> 00:29:12,363
You took the fucking jam
out of my doughnut.

458
00:29:12,572 --> 00:29:13,989
You did.

459
00:29:16,993 --> 00:29:18,202
You said get a good deal.

460
00:29:18,411 --> 00:29:20,913
I fail to recognize
the correlation...

461
00:29:21,081 --> 00:29:24,333
...between losing 10 grand,
hospitalizing Gorgeous...

462
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:25,876
...and a good deal.

463
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:28,253
How'll we explain this to Brick Top?

464
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:30,381
That his fight won't happen?

465
00:29:31,091 --> 00:29:32,299
We replace the fighter.

466
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:34,385
Oh, and hope he doesn't notice?

467
00:29:34,594 --> 00:29:36,512
Who the fuck will we
replace him with?

468
00:29:37,138 --> 00:29:38,514
What about John The Gun?

469
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:41,225
Or Mad Fist Willy?

470
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,686
You're not Mr. Current Affairs,
are you?

471
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:45,938
Mad Fist went mad...

472
00:29:46,106 --> 00:29:48,857
...and The Gun shot himself.

473
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,072
Jesus.

474
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:02,162
- What?
- Let's use the fucking pikey.

475
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:05,958
- How much you gonna pay us?
-10 K.

476
00:30:06,126 --> 00:30:09,503
Me bollocks. Lose more
than that running for the bus.

477
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:18,846
All right.

478
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,057
I'll do it for a caravan.

479
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:23,809
A what?

480
00:30:24,018 --> 00:30:25,227
A caravan.

481
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:29,064
- Top of the range and all that.
- It was us that wanted a caravan.

482
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:31,734
Anyway, what's wrong with this one?

483
00:30:31,985 --> 00:30:34,153
It's not for me.
It's for me ma.

484
00:30:35,989 --> 00:30:36,989
Your what?

485
00:30:37,157 --> 00:30:38,407
His ma.

486
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,020
Brick Top runs an illegal bookies.

487
00:31:08,188 --> 00:31:11,732
They take bets on anything
that involves blood and pain.

488
00:31:11,941 --> 00:31:13,358
Now I'm changing fighters...

489
00:31:14,068 --> 00:31:17,070
...and Brick Top's gonna
exploit the situation.

490
00:31:17,363 --> 00:31:19,948
He's gonna pull my pants down,
grease me up...

491
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,534
...and aim for penetration.

492
00:31:22,702 --> 00:31:24,912
If I didn't have
the replacement pikey...

493
00:31:25,121 --> 00:31:27,456
...he'd want to split me in half.

494
00:31:31,211 --> 00:31:33,587
They could charm the paint off walls,
these fellas.

495
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:43,972
Look mean now,
you hairy fucker, won't you?

496
00:31:45,642 --> 00:31:48,060
Shits himself when
you put him in the ring.

497
00:31:48,228 --> 00:31:50,813
Poke him with a stick,
you watch his bollocks grow.

498
00:31:51,773 --> 00:31:53,649
Do you like a dog fight, Turkish?

499
00:31:54,901 --> 00:31:56,735
We've lost Gorgeous George.

500
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,741
You're gonna have to repeat that.

501
00:32:03,493 --> 00:32:05,911
We've lost Gorgeous George.

502
00:32:06,412 --> 00:32:08,288
Well, where'd you lose him?

503
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:11,083
He ain't a set
of fucking car keys, is he?

504
00:32:11,292 --> 00:32:14,086
And it's not as if he's
incon-fucking-spicuous, is it?

505
00:32:14,254 --> 00:32:15,295
We're not backing out.

506
00:32:15,463 --> 00:32:18,423
You bet your bollocks to
a barn dance you're not.

507
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:20,092
We're changing the fighter.

508
00:32:22,178 --> 00:32:24,930
Oh, fuck me,
your lady friend got a voice?

509
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:27,349
Who are you changing him to,
sweetheart?

510
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,935
You won't know him,
but he's mustard.

511
00:32:30,103 --> 00:32:31,353
Mustard?

512
00:32:31,521 --> 00:32:35,190
I don't care if he's
Muhammad "I'm Hard" Bruce Lee...

513
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:36,859
...you can't change fighters.

514
00:32:37,068 --> 00:32:39,278
- You've still got your fight.
- No.

515
00:32:39,445 --> 00:32:42,698
I lose all bets at the bookies.
You can't change fighters.

516
00:32:42,907 --> 00:32:46,785
So, no, I don't have my fight,
do I, you fucking prat?

517
00:32:46,953 --> 00:32:48,745
You can take bets at the fight.

518
00:32:49,205 --> 00:32:51,623
Put a lead on her, Turkish,
before she gets bitten.

519
00:32:51,791 --> 00:32:54,209
Do you want to get bitten,
sweetheart?

520
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:02,259
Make sure your man goes down
in the fourth.

521
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,846
You understand me now,
don't you, Turkish?

522
00:33:07,223 --> 00:33:09,641
This is the one place
I didn't want to be:

523
00:33:09,851 --> 00:33:11,143
In his debt.

524
00:33:11,394 --> 00:33:13,979
Which now means I'm in his pocket.

525
00:33:14,147 --> 00:33:17,065
You're on thin fucking ice,
my pedigree chums.

526
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:19,985
And I shall be under it
when it breaks.

527
00:33:21,195 --> 00:33:22,487
Now, fuck off.

528
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,999
Doug, where's Franky Four Fingers?

529
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:37,377
I don't know. I'm not his mother.
But I'm seeing him later.

530
00:33:37,587 --> 00:33:40,213
- When later?
- He said he wanted cash.

531
00:33:40,506 --> 00:33:43,508
So he's coming back
after he's been to a fight.

532
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:51,433
A fight?

533
00:33:51,768 --> 00:33:56,021
What do you mean, a fight?
A boxing match?

534
00:33:56,522 --> 00:34:00,901
- Is there gambling involved?
- It's a boxing match, Avi.

535
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,695
- Did he have a case with him?
- Yes, he had a case.

536
00:34:03,905 --> 00:34:05,614
And this schmuck is gambling?

537
00:34:05,865 --> 00:34:10,535
You're talking about Franky "I've got
a problem with gambling" Four Fingers.

538
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:12,371
Avi, I'm not telepathic.

539
00:34:12,538 --> 00:34:14,706
You're plenty stupid,
I'll give you that.

540
00:34:14,916 --> 00:34:17,542
Do you know why they call him
Franky Four Fingers?

541
00:34:17,752 --> 00:34:19,127
I have no idea.

542
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:22,547
Because he makes stupid bets
with dangerous people.

543
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:25,258
When he doesn't pay up,
they give him the chop.

544
00:34:25,426 --> 00:34:27,636
And I'm not talking about
his fucking foreskin.

545
00:34:27,887 --> 00:34:29,304
I'm sure he can pay.

546
00:34:29,555 --> 00:34:33,308
Not with my goods. Got a toothbrush?
We're going to London.

547
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:35,894
Do you hear that?
I'm coming to London!

548
00:34:40,608 --> 00:34:43,652
- Avi!
- Shut up and sit down, you bald fuck!

549
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,490
I don't like leaving my own country...

550
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:52,911
...especially leaving it for anything
less than warm, sandy beaches...

551
00:34:53,121 --> 00:34:55,664
...and cocktails
with little straw hats.

552
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:58,208
We've got sandy beaches.

553
00:34:58,418 --> 00:35:00,293
So who the fuck wants to see them?

554
00:35:00,503 --> 00:35:04,464
I hope you can appreciate the concern
I have for my friend Franky.

555
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:07,009
I'll find him,
and you'll help me find him.

556
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,261
And we'll start at that fight.

557
00:35:11,431 --> 00:35:13,265
How am I gonna get it out?

558
00:35:13,766 --> 00:35:15,267
It will probably cough it up.

559
00:35:15,435 --> 00:35:16,768
Will he be all right?

560
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,270
I hope not.

561
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:21,732
- Are we gonna rob this bookies?
- Yes, big man.

562
00:35:21,899 --> 00:35:23,108
Why are we waiting?

563
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:26,820
We are waiting for a man with
four fingers, carrying a briefcase.

564
00:35:26,988 --> 00:35:27,988
And why's that?

565
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:33,118
Because the deal is, the Russian
gets the case, we get the money.

566
00:35:33,327 --> 00:35:34,828
What's in the case?

567
00:35:35,038 --> 00:35:39,332
For fuck's sake, Tyrone, just
concentrate on the steering wheel.

568
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:42,127
Jesus.

569
00:35:42,295 --> 00:35:45,630
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- I'm well aware of that, my son.

570
00:35:45,798 --> 00:35:47,549
That's why we're here.

571
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:50,552
Well done. This is the back way in.

572
00:35:50,803 --> 00:35:53,805
Oh, really?
I thought it was the front.

573
00:35:54,682 --> 00:35:57,851
- Private night tonight, chaps.
- We know. That's why we're here.

574
00:35:58,519 --> 00:35:59,644
Tickets.

575
00:35:59,979 --> 00:36:02,314
Are we ever gonna get into this place?

576
00:36:02,523 --> 00:36:05,400
Avi, Avi, you gotta understand.

577
00:36:05,651 --> 00:36:08,487
This ain't exactly Vegas,
and this ain't exactly legal.

578
00:36:08,696 --> 00:36:11,573
I'm not looking for Vegas
or for legal.

579
00:36:11,824 --> 00:36:13,658
I'm looking for Franky.

580
00:36:13,868 --> 00:36:17,329
I know that,
and he said he's gonna be here.

581
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:20,415
- If there's gambling, he'll be here.
- Let's not have a fuck-up.

582
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:22,000
You won't let us down.

583
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:26,171
He's going down in the fourth,
don't you worry about that.

584
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:31,009
Is that him?

585
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:33,345
I don't know.
How many fingers did he have?

586
00:36:33,513 --> 00:36:35,680
Sorry, I didn't get
the binoculars out in time.

587
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:38,683
Let's not stand on ceremony.
Let's start the show.

588
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:56,701
Do you know who
this bookies belongs to?

589
00:36:56,869 --> 00:36:59,788
If you know what's good for you
you'll give me everything-

590
00:37:05,419 --> 00:37:06,878
What are you doing?

591
00:37:07,088 --> 00:37:09,548
What does it look like
I'm doing up here?

592
00:37:11,717 --> 00:37:14,594
This is starting to hurt, Solomon.

593
00:37:14,887 --> 00:37:17,097
Drop the screen now.

594
00:37:20,268 --> 00:37:21,518
How you doing, Vince?

595
00:37:21,727 --> 00:37:24,146
I'd do a lot better
if you'd stop using my name.

596
00:37:24,355 --> 00:37:26,398
- Fill that bag.
- All bets are off.

597
00:37:26,941 --> 00:37:30,402
I am not in here
to make a fucking bet.

598
00:37:30,611 --> 00:37:31,820
Appreciated...

599
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:33,947
...but all bets...

600
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:36,908
...are...

601
00:37:37,118 --> 00:37:38,285
...off.

602
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:42,664
If all bets are off, there can't be
any money, can there?

603
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,543
I ain't fucking buying that.

604
00:37:46,794 --> 00:37:50,255
That's handy because I ain't
fucking selling it. It's a fact.

605
00:37:51,257 --> 00:37:52,632
What have you got?

606
00:37:54,427 --> 00:37:56,011
Nothing, really.

607
00:37:58,055 --> 00:37:59,598
A few coins, but no notes.

608
00:38:02,435 --> 00:38:03,435
Show me your hands.

609
00:38:06,063 --> 00:38:07,272
You've got five fingers.

610
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:11,610
Copper coins.

611
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:15,488
What do you mean,
copper fucking coins?

612
00:38:24,207 --> 00:38:28,126
It won't open
because it's a security door.

613
00:38:28,294 --> 00:38:29,461
Hold that.

614
00:38:38,512 --> 00:38:39,930
My leg.

615
00:38:42,642 --> 00:38:46,394
What are you moaning about?
It didn't even touch it.

616
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:56,321
We're fucked.

617
00:39:03,454 --> 00:39:05,705
What the fuck are you two doing?

618
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:11,253
Get us out of here.

619
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,886
Tyrone, what are you doing?
Get us out of here!

620
00:39:27,561 --> 00:39:30,355
Who the fuck is this man, Tyrone?

621
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:36,987
He's a man with four fingers
and a briefcase, Vinny.

622
00:39:39,156 --> 00:39:40,699
In the red corner...

623
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:43,451
...we have the young
and unchallenged...

624
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:47,956
So, Mickey, you're going down
in the fourth. Is that clear?

625
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:49,874
Just make sure he doesn't kill me.

626
00:39:50,501 --> 00:39:53,962
So give it up
for the bone-crunching...

627
00:39:54,213 --> 00:39:56,339
...one-punch machine gun...

628
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,466
...Mickey!

629
00:40:03,472 --> 00:40:06,891
And in the other corner...

630
00:40:07,059 --> 00:40:09,185
Now, I know he looks
like a fat fucker-

631
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:12,314
Well, he is a fat fucker,
but he's dirty and he's dangerous.

632
00:40:12,523 --> 00:40:17,402
Bomber "The Mad Man" Harris!

633
00:40:20,072 --> 00:40:22,198
Now, try and look like a fighter.

634
00:40:22,408 --> 00:40:24,909
Let's get ready...

635
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:27,245
...to rumble!

636
00:41:00,946 --> 00:41:04,491
Do you realize I'm
fucking forty grand down?

637
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,909
What's the fucking crack?

638
00:41:06,118 --> 00:41:08,828
- I'll make it up to you.
- I ain't happy.

639
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,499
I'll make it up to you, I promise.
Stand on me.

640
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:15,835
Oh, that fucking pikey's
put me in it.

641
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:19,714
Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.

642
00:41:19,924 --> 00:41:22,884
Listen, you fucking fringe,
if I throw a dog a bone...

643
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:25,011
...I don't want to know
if it tastes good.

644
00:41:25,179 --> 00:41:29,974
Stop me again whilst I'm walking and
I'll cut your fucking jacobs off.

645
00:41:51,664 --> 00:41:54,624
- He's here.
- Well, you explain it to him.

646
00:42:01,841 --> 00:42:04,551
- What you doing?
- The case was attached to his arm.

647
00:42:04,844 --> 00:42:07,178
So why didn't you chop it off?

648
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:09,681
We ain't fucking butchers, Boris.

649
00:42:09,974 --> 00:42:11,307
But he has the case.

650
00:42:11,517 --> 00:42:14,185
Look, we-
Well, you have a problem.

651
00:42:15,229 --> 00:42:17,689
There weren't much cash
at the bookies.

652
00:42:18,566 --> 00:42:19,816
Okay.

653
00:42:21,068 --> 00:42:22,694
Here is the 10 grand.

654
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:25,989
No. Keep it. We want this.

655
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:28,825
Well, at least half of this.

656
00:42:29,326 --> 00:42:31,870
What was in the case was mine.

657
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,415
What was in the bookies was yours.
Okay?

658
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:39,544
It wasn't much, but here is
the 10 large to help the situation.

659
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:41,546
No, I'm afraid
it's too late for that.

660
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:45,258
We want half of this, and that's
because we're being generous.

661
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:49,679
We could, by all rights, keep
the whole fucking stone, Boris.

662
00:42:59,231 --> 00:43:00,607
Watch out!

663
00:43:03,068 --> 00:43:04,777
Drop the gun, fat boy.

664
00:43:08,616 --> 00:43:12,368
You fucking idiots.
He could not know my name.

665
00:43:13,412 --> 00:43:15,121
Give me the stone.

666
00:43:16,207 --> 00:43:18,708
- It's in the case.
- What?

667
00:43:20,085 --> 00:43:21,085
It's in the case.

668
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:22,962
You put the stone in the case?

669
00:43:24,381 --> 00:43:25,965
Open it and give me the stone.

670
00:43:27,218 --> 00:43:31,221
The only man who knew
the combination, you just shot.

671
00:44:00,793 --> 00:44:04,629
Now, it's not too clever to hang
about after Mickey's performance.

672
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:09,884
Brick Top, in short, will be looking
to kill Tommy, Mickey and myself.

673
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:13,763
I know he's looking for us,
but I don't have a choice.

674
00:44:14,473 --> 00:44:18,643
I'm happy to leave the country,
but I need money to do so.

675
00:44:18,811 --> 00:44:22,647
But any money I have is in the safe,
which is in the office.

676
00:44:22,856 --> 00:44:24,649
Once I have that, it's-

677
00:44:24,858 --> 00:44:25,984
Oink, oink.

678
00:44:26,652 --> 00:44:27,819
Shit.

679
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:31,948
So that's where you keep the sugar.

680
00:44:33,784 --> 00:44:36,828
What brings you two here?
Run out of pants to sniff?

681
00:44:38,372 --> 00:44:40,290
That sounds like hostility,
doesn't it?

682
00:44:40,457 --> 00:44:42,792
And we don't like hostility,
do we, Errol?

683
00:44:43,669 --> 00:44:45,128
No, we don't, John.

684
00:44:57,099 --> 00:44:59,559
I just had them polished.

685
00:45:04,732 --> 00:45:06,691
Go and put the kettle on.

686
00:45:10,154 --> 00:45:13,531
- You take sugar?
- No, thank you, Turkish.

687
00:45:14,366 --> 00:45:16,200
I'm sweet enough.

688
00:45:24,918 --> 00:45:27,003
He is now your problem.

689
00:45:28,422 --> 00:45:29,672
Okay?

690
00:45:37,598 --> 00:45:41,893
You can keep the 10 grand,
along with the body...

691
00:45:42,061 --> 00:45:45,355
...but if I see you again,
you motherfuckers...

692
00:45:46,899 --> 00:45:49,901
Well, look at him.

693
00:45:57,076 --> 00:46:00,119
I've got a bare-knuckle fight
in a couple of days.

694
00:46:00,329 --> 00:46:01,704
I want to use the pikey.

695
00:46:03,248 --> 00:46:04,666
All right. Of course.

696
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,126
Of course, fucking of course.

697
00:46:07,378 --> 00:46:09,879
I wasn't asking, I was telling.

698
00:46:10,923 --> 00:46:12,048
But this time...

699
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,678
...I do want him to go down
in the fourth.

700
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:21,641
And I do mean it, this time.

701
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:34,904
Now, I know you come back here
to open your safe.

702
00:46:37,491 --> 00:46:39,867
So now you can open it.

703
00:46:40,202 --> 00:46:42,537
Turkish has been a busy
little bastard.

704
00:46:42,746 --> 00:46:44,539
I think he's got away with enough.

705
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:48,835
Thinking can get you into trouble,
Errol. I shouldn't do so much of it.

706
00:46:49,086 --> 00:46:51,003
That takes care of one little piggy.

707
00:46:51,255 --> 00:46:54,090
Now find me the silly sods
who blagged the bookies.

708
00:46:54,341 --> 00:46:55,591
Find them today.

709
00:47:14,611 --> 00:47:17,071
Top of the morning
to you, Mrs. O'Neil.

710
00:47:17,865 --> 00:47:18,990
Tommy.

711
00:47:20,242 --> 00:47:23,536
You're a snake in the grass,
ain't you? Where'd they come from?

712
00:47:23,746 --> 00:47:26,038
You're looking for my boy, are you?

713
00:47:26,248 --> 00:47:28,750
- Do you know where I can find him?
- Yeah.

714
00:47:30,002 --> 00:47:32,003
Would you like
to share that information?

715
00:47:32,212 --> 00:47:34,630
I don't want you getting
my boy into trouble.

716
00:47:35,841 --> 00:47:39,135
He's my only boy.
And he's a good boy.

717
00:47:40,763 --> 00:47:42,096
He's coursing.

718
00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:46,184
What's coursing?

719
00:47:46,351 --> 00:47:47,393
Hare coursing.

720
00:47:48,228 --> 00:47:52,190
They set two lurchers-
They're dogs, before you ask.

721
00:47:53,025 --> 00:47:54,650
On a hare.

722
00:47:55,277 --> 00:47:58,362
And the hare has to outrun the dogs.

723
00:47:58,572 --> 00:48:00,656
So, what if it doesn't?

724
00:48:01,950 --> 00:48:05,495
Well, the big rabbit gets fucked,
doesn't it?

725
00:48:08,999 --> 00:48:10,708
Proper fucked?

726
00:48:11,335 --> 00:48:12,752
Yeah, Tommy.

727
00:48:13,086 --> 00:48:15,338
Before "zee" Germans get there.

728
00:48:17,549 --> 00:48:19,383
Do you know these tits, Errol?

729
00:48:19,635 --> 00:48:21,052
I know a lot of tits...

730
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,222
...but I don't know any
as fucking stupid as these two.

731
00:48:24,473 --> 00:48:25,640
John?

732
00:48:26,725 --> 00:48:28,142
I can't help, guv.

733
00:48:32,981 --> 00:48:34,315
Tyrone.

734
00:48:34,525 --> 00:48:37,401
You silly, fat bastard.

735
00:48:38,904 --> 00:48:40,738
- Do you want to do it?
- That depends.

736
00:48:40,906 --> 00:48:41,906
On what?

737
00:48:42,074 --> 00:48:45,034
On you buying this caravan.

738
00:48:45,244 --> 00:48:47,662
Not the rouge one. The rose.

739
00:48:48,205 --> 00:48:50,414
- It's not the same caravan.
- Not the same fight.

740
00:48:50,582 --> 00:48:52,583
It's twice the size of the last one.

741
00:48:52,835 --> 00:48:55,837
The fight is twice the size.
And me ma needs a caravan.

742
00:48:56,046 --> 00:48:59,048
I like to look after me ma.
It's a fair deal. Take it.

743
00:48:59,258 --> 00:49:03,344
You're lucky we aren't worm food
after your last performance.

744
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:06,806
Buying a tart's mobile palace
is a little fucking rich.

745
00:49:09,643 --> 00:49:12,687
I wasn't calling your mum a tart.
I just meant...

746
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:15,231
Save your breath for cooling
your porridge.

747
00:49:23,198 --> 00:49:27,368
Right. And she's terrible
partial to the periwinkle blue.

748
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,080
Have I made myself clear?

749
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:35,501
Yeah, that's perfectly clear, Mickey.

750
00:49:35,794 --> 00:49:39,046
Just give me one minute
to confer with my colleague.

751
00:49:43,719 --> 00:49:45,928
Did you understand a word
of what he said?

752
00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:50,057
I'll tell you what.

753
00:49:51,727 --> 00:49:52,935
Fucker.

754
00:49:53,437 --> 00:49:55,021
I'll bet you for it.

755
00:49:55,522 --> 00:49:56,564
You'll what?

756
00:49:56,773 --> 00:49:58,149
He'll bet you for it.

757
00:49:58,609 --> 00:50:01,611
What, like Tommy did last time?
Do me a favor?

758
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,321
I'll do you a favor.

759
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:06,240
You have first bet.
If I win, I get a caravan...

760
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:08,576
...and the boys get
a pair of them shoes.

761
00:50:10,662 --> 00:50:12,455
If I lose...

762
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:17,668
...fuck it, I'll do the fight
for free.

763
00:50:19,546 --> 00:50:22,465
The last thing I really
want to do is bet a pikey.

764
00:50:22,674 --> 00:50:24,842
However, I don't really
have much of a choice.

765
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:28,721
Somehow I've got to get him to fight,
but if I lose...

766
00:50:28,931 --> 00:50:32,183
Well, I don't even want
to think about losing.

767
00:50:32,643 --> 00:50:36,312
Okay. I reckon the hare gets fucked.

768
00:50:36,521 --> 00:50:38,522
What? Proper fucked?

769
00:50:40,817 --> 00:50:42,485
You got that, London?

770
00:50:42,694 --> 00:50:43,736
We're on!

771
00:51:55,934 --> 00:51:58,853
I'll fucking tell you!
Get those off me.

772
00:51:59,438 --> 00:52:01,230
I'll tell you
who robbed your bookies.

773
00:52:18,206 --> 00:52:20,958
Periwinkle blue. Bye, boys.

774
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:25,337
Who's proper fucked now, then?

775
00:52:26,965 --> 00:52:29,133
There's something very wrong
with this.

776
00:52:29,384 --> 00:52:32,636
It was us that wanted
to buy a caravan off of him.

777
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:38,017
Well, why didn't you "bust a cap
in his ass" then, Tommy?

778
00:52:38,518 --> 00:52:41,771
Mind you, you'd do more damage
if you threw it at him.

779
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,482
What? You saying I can't shoot?

780
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:48,277
Oh, no, Tommy.
I wasn't saying you can't shoot.

781
00:52:48,528 --> 00:52:50,362
I know you can't shoot.

782
00:52:50,614 --> 00:52:54,784
What we're saying is, that piece
of shit stuck in your trousers...

783
00:52:54,951 --> 00:52:57,161
...would do more damage
if you fed it to him.

784
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:58,913
You saying the gun don't work?

785
00:52:59,164 --> 00:53:00,498
You tried it?

786
00:53:05,796 --> 00:53:06,796
Whoops.

787
00:53:09,257 --> 00:53:12,343
I want to see
that sneaky fucking Russian.

788
00:53:12,761 --> 00:53:15,304
Why's he got a tea cozy on his head?

789
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:17,431
To keep his head warm.

790
00:53:17,641 --> 00:53:20,142
- What happened to him?
- He got shot in the face.

791
00:53:20,393 --> 00:53:21,852
I thought that was obvious.

792
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:24,438
What'd you do that for?
You mistake him for a rabbit?

793
00:53:24,648 --> 00:53:27,108
- What do you want me to do?
- Sort it out.

794
00:53:27,317 --> 00:53:30,194
- I'm not a witch doctor.
- But you are a bad boy yardie...

795
00:53:30,403 --> 00:53:33,280
...and bad boy yardies should
know how to get rid of bodies.

796
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,283
I create the bodies,
I don't erase the bodies.

797
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:44,416
We're in, governor.

798
00:53:46,211 --> 00:53:48,212
Goody gumdrops.

799
00:53:48,421 --> 00:53:50,798
Get us a cup of tea,
would you, Errol?

800
00:53:52,676 --> 00:53:53,759
Grab hold of his legs.

801
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:56,846
What do you think
I'm gonna grab him by, his ears?

802
00:54:07,274 --> 00:54:09,942
Hope this is not a bad moment.

803
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:16,240
Do you know who I am?

804
00:54:18,743 --> 00:54:20,077
I do.

805
00:54:27,085 --> 00:54:30,087
Good. That will save me
some time, then.

806
00:54:31,756 --> 00:54:33,299
Well, I don't.

807
00:54:41,016 --> 00:54:45,519
You're always gonna have problems
lifting a body in one piece.

808
00:54:45,729 --> 00:54:47,980
Apparently, the best thing to do...

809
00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:52,860
...is cut up a corpse into six pieces
and pile it all together.

810
00:54:53,778 --> 00:54:56,405
Would someone mind telling me,
who are you?

811
00:54:56,615 --> 00:54:59,658
When you got your six pieces,
you gotta get rid of them.

812
00:54:59,868 --> 00:55:03,370
It's no good leaving it in the freezer
for your mum to discover.

813
00:55:09,044 --> 00:55:12,713
Then I hear the best thing
to do is feed them to pigs.

814
00:55:14,216 --> 00:55:16,383
You gotta starve the pigs
for a few days...

815
00:55:16,593 --> 00:55:19,845
...then the chopped-up body
will look like curry to a pisshead.

816
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:24,892
You gotta shave the heads of your
victims and pull the teeth out...

817
00:55:25,101 --> 00:55:26,644
...for the piggies' digestion.

818
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:29,146
You could do this afterwards,
of course...

819
00:55:29,314 --> 00:55:31,941
...but you don't want
to sieve through pigshit, do you?

820
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:36,820
They will go through bone like butter.

821
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:41,116
You need at least 16 pigs
to finish the job in one sitting...

822
00:55:41,368 --> 00:55:45,371
...so be wary of any man
who keeps a pig farm.

823
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:48,791
They will go through a body
that weighs 200 pounds...

824
00:55:49,042 --> 00:55:50,960
...in about eight minutes.

825
00:55:51,169 --> 00:55:52,836
That means that a single pig...

826
00:55:53,046 --> 00:55:56,757
...can consume two pounds
of uncooked flesh...

827
00:55:57,008 --> 00:55:59,134
...every minute.

828
00:55:59,344 --> 00:56:01,595
Hence the expression...

829
00:56:01,846 --> 00:56:05,182
..."as greedy as a pig. "

830
00:56:08,853 --> 00:56:13,274
Well, thank you for that.
That's a great weight off me mind.

831
00:56:13,483 --> 00:56:16,694
Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me
who the fuck you are...

832
00:56:16,903 --> 00:56:19,863
...apart from someone who feeds
people to pigs, of course.

833
00:56:24,077 --> 00:56:26,036
Do you know what "nemesis" means?

834
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:33,836
"A righteous infliction
of retribution...

835
00:56:34,087 --> 00:56:37,756
...manifested by an
appropriate agent. "

836
00:56:37,966 --> 00:56:42,886
Personified, in this case,
by a horrible cunt:

837
00:56:43,471 --> 00:56:44,888
Me.

838
00:56:52,731 --> 00:56:54,064
Gentlemen...

839
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,765
Why can't you find me Franky, Doug?

840
00:57:27,932 --> 00:57:32,811
Avi, what do you want me to do?
I'm not a bounty hunter.

841
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:35,606
What about Tony?

842
00:57:35,774 --> 00:57:37,066
Bullet-Tooth Tony.

843
00:57:37,233 --> 00:57:38,233
Who's Bullet-Tooth-?

844
00:57:38,401 --> 00:57:40,527
- Tony!
- You silly fuck.

845
00:57:40,695 --> 00:57:41,779
He's a liability.

846
00:57:41,946 --> 00:57:44,198
He'd find Moses
and the burning bush.

847
00:57:44,407 --> 00:57:45,866
You are gonna die, Tony!

848
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:49,370
He got shot six times,
had the bullets molded into gold.

849
00:57:50,163 --> 00:57:51,955
I shoot you, you go down!

850
00:57:52,123 --> 00:57:55,000
He has two in his teeth
that Dad did, so he loves Dad.

851
00:57:56,044 --> 00:57:57,920
Why don't you fucking die?

852
00:57:58,088 --> 00:58:00,839
- He's the best chance you got.
- Six times?

853
00:58:02,384 --> 00:58:03,801
In one sitting.

854
00:58:04,552 --> 00:58:06,345
You're in trouble now.

855
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:10,224
Sounds promising.
What are we waiting for?

856
00:58:22,779 --> 00:58:23,821
Bonjour.

857
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:29,660
What's so fucking important?

858
00:58:29,869 --> 00:58:32,121
Why do you think
we've got a dead man...

859
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:35,165
- ... missing an arm in our office?
- Talk to me, tell me.

860
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:37,167
You give us four days...

861
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:41,088
...I'll get you a stone the size
of a fucking home. I kid you not.

862
00:58:41,256 --> 00:58:42,506
What do you think, Errol?

863
00:58:42,674 --> 00:58:46,009
I think we should drip-dry them,
while we got the chance.

864
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:48,470
It was a rhetorical question, Errol.

865
00:58:48,763 --> 00:58:51,348
What have I told you about thinking?

866
00:58:51,975 --> 00:58:54,143
- You got 48 hours.
- Yeah.

867
00:58:54,352 --> 00:58:57,688
You can keep that silly, fat wanker.
The lads can't lift him.

868
00:58:57,897 --> 00:58:59,148
Forty-eight hours.

869
00:58:59,441 --> 00:59:00,858
After that it's your family...

870
00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:03,944
...and the pigs finish
what the dogs don't do.

871
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:10,325
So, what should I call you?
Should I call you "Bullet"? "Tooth"?

872
00:59:10,493 --> 00:59:12,202
Call me "Susan"
if it makes you happy.

873
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:15,873
Tony, there is a man
I'd like you to find.

874
00:59:16,124 --> 00:59:19,793
That depends on all the elements
in the equation. How many are there?

875
00:59:20,044 --> 00:59:21,086
Forty thousand.

876
00:59:23,923 --> 00:59:25,591
Where was he last seen?

877
00:59:26,468 --> 00:59:27,468
At a bookies.

878
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:29,386
Bookies?

879
00:59:31,639 --> 00:59:33,515
Pass us the blower, Susi.

880
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:40,647
- Bookies got blagged last night.
- Blagged? Speak English.

881
00:59:40,857 --> 00:59:45,611
This country spawned the language,
and nobody seems to speak it.

882
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:47,237
Blagged, robbed.

883
00:59:47,489 --> 00:59:49,823
We'll see a man
that may know something.

884
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:51,825
I need a gun.

885
00:59:52,076 --> 00:59:55,162
You don't, Rosebud, me old son.
You need me.

886
00:59:57,665 --> 01:00:00,042
I got fucking black ink all
over fuck boy.

887
01:00:00,293 --> 01:00:02,377
He's stained for fucking life.

888
01:00:02,629 --> 01:00:05,339
That and the golden teeth as well.
Fucking hell-

889
01:00:05,548 --> 01:00:06,924
All right, Mullet?

890
01:00:11,846 --> 01:00:13,639
How you doing?
You all right, mate?

891
01:00:14,349 --> 01:00:15,766
Nice tie.

892
01:00:15,934 --> 01:00:17,726
I heard you weren't about that much.

893
01:00:17,894 --> 01:00:21,146
Still warm, the blood
that courses through my veins.

894
01:00:21,773 --> 01:00:23,565
Unlike yours, Mullet.

895
01:00:24,275 --> 01:00:25,901
Who blagged Brick Top's bookies?

896
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:29,446
- Do me a favor, Tone.
- I will do you a favor, Mullet.

897
01:00:29,656 --> 01:00:33,450
I'll not bash the fuck out of you
in front of all your girlfriends.

898
01:00:34,285 --> 01:00:37,913
Gonna make it worth my while, mate?
Jesus, you know how it is, man.

899
01:00:41,876 --> 01:00:43,794
Comfortable, Mullet?

900
01:00:44,128 --> 01:00:47,089
It's sadly ironic it's that tie
that's got you into this pickle.

901
01:00:47,298 --> 01:00:50,133
Now, you take all
the time you want, mate.

902
01:00:50,552 --> 01:00:52,427
What the fuck you doing, Tone?

903
01:00:52,637 --> 01:00:55,264
Driving down the street
with your head in my window.

904
01:00:56,099 --> 01:00:59,518
- What you think I'm doing?
- Well, don't, Tone.

905
01:01:00,645 --> 01:01:02,604
You been using dog shit
for toothpaste?

906
01:01:02,814 --> 01:01:04,106
Slow down, Tone.

907
01:01:04,357 --> 01:01:06,441
Slow down, Tony!

908
01:01:06,651 --> 01:01:09,236
I don't think so.
I think I'll speed up.

909
01:01:10,697 --> 01:01:12,781
Play some music if you like.

910
01:01:14,659 --> 01:01:16,034
I love this track.

911
01:01:17,287 --> 01:01:19,913
I want to know who blagged
Brick Top's bookies.

912
01:01:20,456 --> 01:01:21,623
Yes, Mullet?

913
01:01:21,916 --> 01:01:27,129
I think it's two black guys that work
from a pawnshop in Smith Street.

914
01:01:27,297 --> 01:01:29,172
Better not be telling me porky pies.

915
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:34,970
I tell you, it's two black guys work
out of a pawnshop on Smith Street.

916
01:01:35,471 --> 01:01:37,598
It's very effective, Tony.

917
01:01:37,849 --> 01:01:39,891
It's not too subtle, but effective.

918
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:42,936
Are we taking him with us?

919
01:01:52,238 --> 01:01:53,363
It's the Russian.

920
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:55,532
A Russian?

921
01:01:55,742 --> 01:01:58,368
To be technical he's an Uzbekistanian.

922
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:03,165
Uzbekistanian? I've been dealing
with those sneaky Russian dogs.

923
01:02:04,042 --> 01:02:05,667
- Give me a name.
- Yurinov.

924
01:02:05,918 --> 01:02:07,294
Boris.

925
01:02:07,795 --> 01:02:09,379
- Boris The Blade?
- Yeah.

926
01:02:09,631 --> 01:02:12,507
As in Boris The Bullet-Dodger?

927
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:16,470
Why do they call him
The Bullet-Dodger?

928
01:02:17,388 --> 01:02:19,806
Because he dodges bullets, Avi.

929
01:02:21,684 --> 01:02:24,686
He won't fight unless
we buy his mum a caravan...

930
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:26,521
...and you nicked all our savings.

931
01:02:26,731 --> 01:02:31,026
In the quiet words
of the Virgin Mary, come again?

932
01:02:31,944 --> 01:02:35,864
He's a stubborn bastard. He said
he's got to look after his mum.

933
01:02:36,074 --> 01:02:38,450
- Are you taking the piss?
- What can I do?

934
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:40,869
I can't make him do it, can I?

935
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:44,247
You're not much good to me alive
are you, Turkish?

936
01:02:49,295 --> 01:02:53,298
He's a useless shite, that boy.
Punish him for me, Errol.

937
01:02:54,592 --> 01:02:56,885
I want that pikey to fight.

938
01:03:21,411 --> 01:03:24,579
Brick Top thought smashing up
our arcade...

939
01:03:24,831 --> 01:03:27,874
...might help me
to persuade Mickey to fight.

940
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:30,836
And if that wasn't enough...

941
01:03:31,003 --> 01:03:34,005
...he thought it would be
a good idea...

942
01:03:34,173 --> 01:03:36,758
...to burn Mickey's mum's caravan.

943
01:03:38,177 --> 01:03:39,970
While she was asleep in it.

944
01:04:37,153 --> 01:04:39,279
Turkish, get your arse up.

945
01:04:39,822 --> 01:04:40,822
You lot...

946
01:04:41,491 --> 01:04:44,034
...follow me
and I'll fucking shoot you.

947
01:04:45,036 --> 01:04:47,954
Calm down, son. Behave yourself.

948
01:04:48,122 --> 01:04:52,167
I've got the gun, son.
I think it's you who should behave.

949
01:04:52,752 --> 01:04:53,877
What?

950
01:04:54,212 --> 01:04:57,005
You want to see
if I've got the minerals?

951
01:05:15,566 --> 01:05:16,942
Jesus.

952
01:05:17,109 --> 01:05:18,777
Sorry, Mickey.

953
01:05:19,821 --> 01:05:21,488
Did you do it?

954
01:05:26,494 --> 01:05:28,078
Then what are you sorry for?

955
01:05:29,330 --> 01:05:31,790
- What are you two doing here?
- Come back!

956
01:05:31,999 --> 01:05:34,876
- You got some tars on you.
- Fuck off, Darren.

957
01:05:35,795 --> 01:05:37,170
Fuck off!

958
01:05:44,178 --> 01:05:46,263
How silly do I feel?

959
01:05:46,430 --> 01:05:49,474
His mum is still smoking
next to us...

960
01:05:49,684 --> 01:05:51,768
...and I'm asking him to fight.

961
01:05:52,687 --> 01:05:55,856
I'll do the fight before he causes
any more carnage.

962
01:05:56,399 --> 01:05:58,191
And if he'd said no...

963
01:05:58,359 --> 01:06:00,777
...it could've been
a shite sight worse.

964
01:06:06,784 --> 01:06:08,368
Russians.

965
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:15,250
Russians.

966
01:06:15,459 --> 01:06:16,960
I should've known.

967
01:06:17,128 --> 01:06:21,089
Anti-Semite, slippery Cossack sluts.

968
01:06:21,299 --> 01:06:23,383
What do you know about this goyim?

969
01:06:23,968 --> 01:06:25,635
Ex-KGB cancer.

970
01:06:26,304 --> 01:06:28,597
He was a highly trained
undercover agent.

971
01:06:28,806 --> 01:06:31,057
He'll be impossible to track down.

972
01:06:32,059 --> 01:06:33,101
Yeah.

973
01:06:33,311 --> 01:06:36,730
There's a strange man who wants
to sell us an 84-karat stone.

974
01:06:36,939 --> 01:06:39,482
- Where's he from?
- I don't know. Hard to tell.

975
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:41,276
He's got a thick Russian accent.

976
01:06:53,789 --> 01:06:58,293
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He set the dogs on me. Look.

977
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:02,047
That sneaky Russian!
No wonder he didn't want to do it.

978
01:07:02,256 --> 01:07:05,175
First things first. One of us...

979
01:07:05,384 --> 01:07:10,305
...Tyrone, you go to the Russian's.
The second you see him, call us.

980
01:07:10,806 --> 01:07:11,973
Now.

981
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:21,107
He's a right handful,
this fella, so watch out.

982
01:07:21,317 --> 01:07:24,819
I hate Russians.
I'll take care of him.

983
01:07:24,987 --> 01:07:26,696
All yours, Rosebud, old son.

984
01:07:27,698 --> 01:07:29,532
Not a problem.

985
01:07:31,327 --> 01:07:32,994
Get me to a doctor.

986
01:07:33,245 --> 01:07:36,039
Shoot that fuck!
Then, get me to a doctor.

987
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:38,208
Okay, but first we get the stone.

988
01:07:38,459 --> 01:07:40,627
First the stone. Then a doctor.

989
01:07:40,836 --> 01:07:43,713
And not just any doctor, boychik.
A nice Jewish doctor.

990
01:07:43,965 --> 01:07:46,049
Find my friend a nice Jewish doctor!

991
01:07:50,179 --> 01:07:52,806
Get his keys
and find out where the stone is.

992
01:07:53,057 --> 01:07:57,477
- I think you got something to tell us.
- Take it easy, Rosebud.

993
01:07:57,687 --> 01:07:59,980
Do you want him to be able
to talk or not?

994
01:08:00,189 --> 01:08:02,607
What the fuck do you mean, replicas?

995
01:08:02,817 --> 01:08:06,486
They look the shit, don't they?
And nobody is gonna argue.

996
01:08:06,696 --> 01:08:09,364
I've got extra loud blanks,
just in case.

997
01:08:10,116 --> 01:08:13,243
In case we have
to deafen them to death?

998
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:21,001
- Yeah.
- Boris is here.

999
01:08:21,252 --> 01:08:24,337
- We're coming over. Hold him there.
- Hold on!

1000
01:08:24,588 --> 01:08:25,672
He's not on his own!

1001
01:08:31,929 --> 01:08:33,138
We're off.

1002
01:08:37,727 --> 01:08:40,270
Very industrious for a Cossack.

1003
01:08:48,696 --> 01:08:51,322
Sneaky fucking Russian.

1004
01:08:54,994 --> 01:08:56,036
So, where is he?

1005
01:08:56,245 --> 01:08:58,955
It's not just he.
Three fellas went in the house.

1006
01:08:59,123 --> 01:09:02,167
- They locked Boris in the car.
- Why didn't you tell us that?

1007
01:09:03,794 --> 01:09:04,961
Did they look hard?

1008
01:09:05,129 --> 01:09:06,463
They looked messy.

1009
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:09,466
- Let's get out of here.
- What about the Russian?

1010
01:09:09,717 --> 01:09:11,551
I want you to bury him.

1011
01:09:12,094 --> 01:09:13,136
All right.

1012
01:09:14,805 --> 01:09:17,057
I think we should get you a new gun.

1013
01:09:17,308 --> 01:09:18,975
But this time, try it.

1014
01:09:19,185 --> 01:09:21,436
How far to the Russian's?

1015
01:09:21,645 --> 01:09:23,229
Be there in a minute.

1016
01:09:29,111 --> 01:09:31,613
- Come on, then.
- No, no, not so fast, Vinny.

1017
01:09:31,822 --> 01:09:34,824
We can't take them now.
We're gonna have to follow them.

1018
01:09:36,452 --> 01:09:38,953
You shouldn't drink
that stuff, anyway.

1019
01:09:39,246 --> 01:09:40,789
Why? What's wrong with it?

1020
01:09:40,998 --> 01:09:43,958
- It's not in sync with evolution.
- Shut up.

1021
01:09:44,168 --> 01:09:45,585
How do we get rid of him?

1022
01:09:45,795 --> 01:09:48,254
- Do you want to shoot him?
- It's a little noisy.

1023
01:09:48,464 --> 01:09:51,508
- Do you want to stab him?
- That's a little cold-blooded.

1024
01:09:51,675 --> 01:09:55,178
- Do you want to kill him or not?
- I'll cut him. I got a blade.

1025
01:09:55,387 --> 01:09:56,805
That's the spirit.

1026
01:09:57,014 --> 01:09:58,515
Do they fire?

1027
01:09:58,682 --> 01:10:00,016
Of course they fire.

1028
01:10:00,184 --> 01:10:02,435
But how do you know?
They're replicas.

1029
01:10:02,603 --> 01:10:04,604
What do you know about replicas?

1030
01:10:08,901 --> 01:10:10,902
What the fuck are you doing, Solomon?

1031
01:10:11,112 --> 01:10:13,321
You wanted to know
whether they worked.

1032
01:10:13,489 --> 01:10:18,451
I didn't mean try it in the car,
Sol, you arsehole!

1033
01:10:18,619 --> 01:10:21,204
What are you gonna do with that,
pick his teeth?

1034
01:10:21,372 --> 01:10:25,125
Wipe the butter off and put it away.
There's a proper blade back there.

1035
01:10:25,292 --> 01:10:28,711
Cows have only been domesticated
in the last 8000 years.

1036
01:10:28,921 --> 01:10:31,422
Before, they were running
around mad as lorries.

1037
01:10:31,632 --> 01:10:35,593
The human digestive system hasn't
got used to any dairy products yet.

1038
01:10:35,803 --> 01:10:38,888
Well, fuck me, Tommy.
What have you been reading?

1039
01:10:39,056 --> 01:10:41,015
Let me do you a favor.

1040
01:10:46,147 --> 01:10:47,147
Whoops.

1041
01:10:47,314 --> 01:10:48,815
You. Want a knife?

1042
01:10:49,024 --> 01:10:51,192
No, not me.
I wouldn't know what to do.

1043
01:10:51,443 --> 01:10:53,611
It's a knife, for God's sake.

1044
01:10:53,821 --> 01:10:55,905
What's kept your fork company
all these years?

1045
01:10:56,115 --> 01:10:59,701
The sharp side, a blunt side.
What do you want, a lesson?

1046
01:11:22,057 --> 01:11:23,224
Is that Boris?

1047
01:11:41,035 --> 01:11:43,786
Oh, Tyrone, what have you done?

1048
01:11:45,122 --> 01:11:46,623
What about Rosebud?

1049
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:49,626
Well, you can bring him
with you if you like.

1050
01:11:51,003 --> 01:11:52,462
But which bit would you like?

1051
01:11:56,967 --> 01:11:58,051
They're getting out.

1052
01:11:59,094 --> 01:12:01,262
Get down and follow them.

1053
01:12:01,513 --> 01:12:03,514
Cover yourself up, Avi.

1054
01:12:03,724 --> 01:12:05,099
You're making a scene.

1055
01:12:05,392 --> 01:12:07,936
I'm sorry for causing a scene, Tony.

1056
01:12:08,562 --> 01:12:11,272
Whoa, you are not taking
that dog with you, Vince.

1057
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,149
I can't leave him in here, can I?

1058
01:12:20,241 --> 01:12:22,242
Pint of the black stuff, landlord.

1059
01:12:23,786 --> 01:12:27,789
I thought you wanted to get
cleaned up. Bathroom's back there.

1060
01:12:27,998 --> 01:12:31,751
- He's left the door open.
- Shouldn't think that's a good idea.

1061
01:12:31,961 --> 01:12:33,419
Should we go in?

1062
01:12:33,629 --> 01:12:37,090
I don't want to go in there.
He's a dangerous bastard.

1063
01:12:37,341 --> 01:12:41,386
Taken too many disco biscuits
in the heat of Russian disputations.

1064
01:12:41,637 --> 01:12:45,098
He's got as many of these nuts
as he has those nuts.

1065
01:12:45,349 --> 01:12:48,268
I don't care if
he's got fucking hazelnuts.

1066
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:52,230
I want a gun that works,
and I'm gonna tell him.

1067
01:12:52,690 --> 01:12:56,484
My God, Tommy, you certainly
got those minerals.

1068
01:12:56,777 --> 01:13:00,446
Well, come on then,
before "zee" Germans get here.

1069
01:13:00,656 --> 01:13:02,949
You just tell him who's in charge.

1070
01:13:08,914 --> 01:13:10,164
Boris-

1071
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:16,671
You certainly told him.

1072
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,722
The Drowning Trout.

1073
01:13:27,599 --> 01:13:30,476
Come and pick us up. And Doug...

1074
01:13:31,270 --> 01:13:33,229
...sharpish.

1075
01:13:53,417 --> 01:13:56,294
I don't want a fuss or to put
a bullet in your face...

1076
01:13:56,545 --> 01:14:00,173
...but unless you give me what
I want, there will be fucking murders.

1077
01:14:02,926 --> 01:14:03,926
What's your name?

1078
01:14:04,803 --> 01:14:05,803
Shoot him.

1079
01:14:13,103 --> 01:14:16,856
Let go of the gun!

1080
01:14:22,696 --> 01:14:26,115
So, you're obviously the big dick...

1081
01:14:26,909 --> 01:14:29,744
...and that, on either side of you,
are your balls.

1082
01:14:30,621 --> 01:14:32,872
There are two types of balls:

1083
01:14:33,624 --> 01:14:37,585
There are big brave balls,
and there are little faggot balls.

1084
01:14:37,795 --> 01:14:40,296
These are your last words
so make them a prayer.

1085
01:14:40,881 --> 01:14:43,132
Dicks have drive
and clarity of vision...

1086
01:14:44,301 --> 01:14:45,885
...but they're not clever.

1087
01:14:46,345 --> 01:14:49,472
They smell pussy and they want
a piece of the action.

1088
01:14:50,432 --> 01:14:53,643
And you thought you smelled
some good old pussy...

1089
01:14:53,936 --> 01:14:57,146
...and have brought your
two little faggot balls along...

1090
01:14:57,398 --> 01:15:00,900
...for a good old time. But
you've got your parties muddled up.

1091
01:15:02,569 --> 01:15:04,237
There's no pussy here...

1092
01:15:05,155 --> 01:15:08,658
...just a dose that'll make you wish
you were born a woman.

1093
01:15:09,326 --> 01:15:11,077
Like a prick...

1094
01:15:12,037 --> 01:15:13,621
...you're having second thoughts.

1095
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:16,499
You're shrinking.

1096
01:15:17,334 --> 01:15:20,044
And your two little balls
are shrinking with you.

1097
01:15:21,171 --> 01:15:24,632
The fact that you've got "Replica"
written on the side of your gun...

1098
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:34,350
...and the fact that
I've got "Desert Eagle. 50"...

1099
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:38,813
...written on the side of mine...

1100
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:45,486
...should precipitate...

1101
01:15:46,655 --> 01:15:50,491
...your balls into shrinking,
along with your presence.

1102
01:15:52,786 --> 01:15:53,870
Now...

1103
01:15:56,582 --> 01:15:58,040
...fuck off.

1104
01:16:13,432 --> 01:16:14,891
Lock the door.

1105
01:16:15,184 --> 01:16:16,476
Lock it!

1106
01:16:22,357 --> 01:16:23,649
Give me the case.

1107
01:16:24,443 --> 01:16:26,027
Fuck you.

1108
01:16:27,029 --> 01:16:28,029
Shoot me.

1109
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:30,490
I will. I'll shoot you.

1110
01:16:40,626 --> 01:16:43,586
Pass me case or I shoot you.

1111
01:16:44,505 --> 01:16:46,047
You know what?

1112
01:16:46,256 --> 01:16:47,381
Fuck you too.

1113
01:16:47,549 --> 01:16:51,260
Go ahead and shoot me. You'd be
doing me a favor, you Russian fuck.

1114
01:16:51,470 --> 01:16:54,222
You! Drop guns.

1115
01:16:54,723 --> 01:16:55,765
Fuck you!

1116
01:16:55,933 --> 01:16:57,975
You drop your gun!

1117
01:16:59,269 --> 01:17:00,603
Okay.

1118
01:17:01,522 --> 01:17:02,688
Avi...

1119
01:17:02,856 --> 01:17:04,023
...pull your socks up!

1120
01:17:17,204 --> 01:17:20,831
- Tyrone?
- Fuck it. We're out of here.

1121
01:17:21,959 --> 01:17:23,543
Give me case.

1122
01:17:36,223 --> 01:17:37,473
Avi...

1123
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:40,726
- ... where's the case?
- Put the gun away.

1124
01:17:42,187 --> 01:17:43,980
What's Boris doing here?

1125
01:17:44,982 --> 01:17:47,066
Boris, what are you doing here?

1126
01:17:47,276 --> 01:17:49,277
Fuck you!

1127
01:17:57,869 --> 01:17:59,287
Where's the case?

1128
01:18:00,706 --> 01:18:03,332
- You piece of crap.
- Don't take the piss, Boris.

1129
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:05,751
I'll show you.

1130
01:18:09,298 --> 01:18:10,881
Fuck you!

1131
01:18:14,595 --> 01:18:16,721
Almost had it.

1132
01:18:17,014 --> 01:18:18,764
For fuck's sake.

1133
01:18:23,353 --> 01:18:25,021
Fuck you and all.

1134
01:18:26,607 --> 01:18:29,358
You lucky bastard.

1135
01:18:35,198 --> 01:18:37,617
Jeez, it's flawless.

1136
01:18:38,285 --> 01:18:41,078
Don't get attached to it.
It's going to Brick Top.

1137
01:18:41,371 --> 01:18:42,538
Leave the dog here.

1138
01:18:42,748 --> 01:18:47,627
- Sol, why don't we just leave?
- Because life's too short, Vincent...

1139
01:18:47,878 --> 01:18:50,713
...and it'll get a lot shorter
if Brick Top wishes.

1140
01:18:50,964 --> 01:18:54,216
- Now leave that dog here.
- I'm gonna leave the dog here.

1141
01:18:54,384 --> 01:18:55,551
Don't worry about it!

1142
01:18:55,719 --> 01:18:59,430
And if that pikey mutt does
any damage, you're gonna pay.

1143
01:19:01,224 --> 01:19:02,308
It's okay.

1144
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:04,894
Sit down. Down.

1145
01:19:09,900 --> 01:19:12,943
I don't want to go in there.
You'll never see me again.

1146
01:19:13,195 --> 01:19:15,446
Well, we won't if you don't.

1147
01:19:16,239 --> 01:19:18,282
All right, you give me the stone...

1148
01:19:18,575 --> 01:19:22,411
...and I will give it
to Brick Top. Yeah?

1149
01:19:22,579 --> 01:19:26,791
All right. Give me a minute.
It's a bit fiddly.

1150
01:19:30,629 --> 01:19:31,921
Why is it down there?

1151
01:19:32,923 --> 01:19:35,883
Well, I put it down there
in case we got mugged.

1152
01:19:36,259 --> 01:19:38,010
You ain't from this planet, are you?

1153
01:19:38,178 --> 01:19:42,098
Who is gonna mug two black fellas
holding pistols...

1154
01:19:42,265 --> 01:19:46,102
...sat in a car that's worth less
than your shirt?

1155
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:52,733
Bullet-Tooth Tony and his friend,
Desert Eagle. 50.

1156
01:19:52,943 --> 01:19:55,444
What have they got to do
with anything?

1157
01:19:55,654 --> 01:19:57,947
They're both staring straight at me.

1158
01:20:00,951 --> 01:20:05,287
You should never underestimate
the predictability of stupidity.

1159
01:20:05,455 --> 01:20:06,789
Now, out of the car.

1160
01:20:06,957 --> 01:20:09,291
And leave your water pistols behind.

1161
01:20:10,127 --> 01:20:13,838
Look, just tell him the stone's back
at the office.

1162
01:20:14,131 --> 01:20:15,631
I'll think of something.

1163
01:20:20,262 --> 01:20:21,554
Why's he sweating?

1164
01:20:23,765 --> 01:20:24,807
Oh, never mind.

1165
01:20:25,016 --> 01:20:27,768
Tommy, why is your skin leaking?

1166
01:20:27,936 --> 01:20:32,106
- I'm a little worried, actually.
- Worried about what?

1167
01:20:32,649 --> 01:20:36,527
What happens if the gypsy knocks
the other man out?

1168
01:20:36,778 --> 01:20:38,821
I mean, he's done it before,
hasn't he?

1169
01:20:38,989 --> 01:20:43,117
We get murdered before we leave the
building, and we get fed to the pigs.

1170
01:20:43,869 --> 01:20:47,788
I'm glad to see you're climbing
the walls in fucking anxiety.

1171
01:20:49,499 --> 01:20:53,627
Pardon my cynicism,
but I don't exactly trust the pikey.

1172
01:20:53,879 --> 01:20:56,130
Don't think I haven't thunk
about that one.

1173
01:20:56,339 --> 01:21:00,009
It's his mum's funeral tonight.
God bless her.

1174
01:21:02,679 --> 01:21:05,681
You know those gypsies
like a drink at a wake.

1175
01:21:05,849 --> 01:21:09,351
I'm not worried about whether Mickey
knocks the other man out.

1176
01:21:09,519 --> 01:21:12,688
I'm worried about whether he makes it
to the fourth round.

1177
01:21:12,856 --> 01:21:15,649
What if he doesn't make it
to the fourth round?

1178
01:21:15,859 --> 01:21:18,110
We get murdered before leaving
the building...

1179
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,530
...and I imagine we get fed
to the pigs.

1180
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,701
So why are you so calm?

1181
01:21:26,661 --> 01:21:29,038
- I said-
- I heard what you said, Tommy!

1182
01:21:29,664 --> 01:21:32,500
It's not as though we've got a choice,
now, is it?

1183
01:21:32,667 --> 01:21:35,669
You show me how to control
a wild fucking gypsy...

1184
01:21:35,921 --> 01:21:40,382
...and I'll show you how to control
an unhinged, pig-feeding gangster.

1185
01:21:41,551 --> 01:21:44,220
Bollocks! I'm going for a walk.

1186
01:22:24,094 --> 01:22:25,761
Oh, that fucking dog!

1187
01:22:27,097 --> 01:22:28,722
Go on, get the dog.

1188
01:22:29,599 --> 01:22:32,893
- It's a bit funky in here, isn't it?
- Open a window.

1189
01:22:41,069 --> 01:22:43,320
You people live like animals.

1190
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:45,489
Now, where's the stone?

1191
01:22:45,782 --> 01:22:47,950
- Come on, where is it?
- It's over here.

1192
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:51,287
- Where? Where?
- I left it in a box.

1193
01:22:56,585 --> 01:22:57,626
It's empty.

1194
01:22:57,794 --> 01:23:00,921
I'm getting heartburn.
Tony, do something terrible.

1195
01:23:01,798 --> 01:23:03,966
No, I'm being serious!

1196
01:23:04,134 --> 01:23:06,802
The dog. The dog must have ate it.

1197
01:23:10,348 --> 01:23:13,809
Now then, let's have a look,
shall we? Tony.

1198
01:23:15,145 --> 01:23:17,813
- What?
- Look in the dog.

1199
01:23:19,274 --> 01:23:22,234
- You mean, "look in the dog"?
- I mean, open him up.

1200
01:23:26,489 --> 01:23:29,825
It's not a tin of baked beans.
What do you mean, open him up?

1201
01:23:29,993 --> 01:23:32,036
You know what I mean.

1202
01:23:34,623 --> 01:23:35,664
That's a bit strong.

1203
01:23:37,626 --> 01:23:38,751
I don't know about this.

1204
01:23:40,211 --> 01:23:41,962
No, you can't do this.

1205
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:46,133
It's fucking squeaking!

1206
01:23:46,301 --> 01:23:50,387
You never heard a dog squeak before?
Give me that goddamn gun!

1207
01:23:52,974 --> 01:23:54,642
I'm shooting the dog!

1208
01:24:02,901 --> 01:24:04,652
Shoot the fucking dog!

1209
01:24:15,330 --> 01:24:18,165
You sneaky fucking bastard.

1210
01:24:30,095 --> 01:24:31,178
Thank God for that.

1211
01:24:41,564 --> 01:24:44,900
I hate fucking dogs!
Come on, Tony.

1212
01:24:47,862 --> 01:24:49,571
Tony, come on!

1213
01:24:57,872 --> 01:24:59,123
Tony?

1214
01:25:11,302 --> 01:25:14,221
- Anything to declare?
- Yeah. Don't go to England.

1215
01:25:16,725 --> 01:25:20,644
That dog is gonna go back
to the campsite. It always does.

1216
01:25:20,937 --> 01:25:23,063
How's the dog
gonna find the campsite?

1217
01:25:23,273 --> 01:25:25,357
Have you smelled the campsite, Sol?

1218
01:25:25,567 --> 01:25:28,736
All right. But we have
to wait until it gets light.

1219
01:25:28,945 --> 01:25:30,904
And we have to get rid
of these bodies.

1220
01:25:31,114 --> 01:25:34,450
That one with the tea cozy
on his head's starting to stink.

1221
01:25:34,659 --> 01:25:39,830
Right. Let's stick them in the car,
and then go and look for a pig farm.

1222
01:25:43,001 --> 01:25:44,334
Mickey.

1223
01:25:46,421 --> 01:25:47,588
Mickey!

1224
01:25:50,258 --> 01:25:52,092
You feeling all right, Mickey?

1225
01:25:54,929 --> 01:25:56,096
Need a drink.

1226
01:25:58,767 --> 01:26:00,184
You can't give him a drink!

1227
01:26:00,477 --> 01:26:02,478
It's not for him. It's for me.

1228
01:26:08,026 --> 01:26:10,110
Ah, mates. Amen.

1229
01:26:16,993 --> 01:26:21,538
He's a hard bastard, this Good Night
Anderson, so pay attention.

1230
01:26:22,499 --> 01:26:23,874
All right, Mickey?

1231
01:26:24,626 --> 01:26:26,001
Mickey!

1232
01:26:30,548 --> 01:26:32,299
Need to have a shite!

1233
01:26:33,343 --> 01:26:37,846
If you see the pikey, Turkish or
his girlfriend come out before me...

1234
01:26:38,014 --> 01:26:40,516
...shoot the bastards.

1235
01:26:42,352 --> 01:26:45,312
Well, come on.
We got a fight to go to.

1236
01:26:52,362 --> 01:26:53,821
All right, Tom.

1237
01:26:54,447 --> 01:26:58,450
- Hope we get a better show this time.
- This will make up for it.

1238
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:01,370
Mickey's going down in the fourth.

1239
01:27:01,579 --> 01:27:04,164
Terry over there is in charge
of the bets.

1240
01:27:04,415 --> 01:27:05,958
Now, you have to forgive me.

1241
01:27:06,167 --> 01:27:08,919
I'll forgive you
if he goes down this time.

1242
01:27:12,173 --> 01:27:15,175
- Our lads at the campsite?
- They're over there now.

1243
01:27:18,388 --> 01:27:20,722
I fucking hate pikeys.

1244
01:27:22,517 --> 01:27:26,562
- How long have we gotta stay here?
- As long as it takes. Now, shut up.

1245
01:27:27,605 --> 01:27:29,606
Fucking hate pikeys.

1246
01:27:30,733 --> 01:27:32,734
Is he fucking stoned?

1247
01:27:33,236 --> 01:27:35,237
He's like that before a fight.

1248
01:27:35,572 --> 01:27:37,906
Do you know
when you're going down?

1249
01:27:38,074 --> 01:27:40,701
Of course he knows
when he's going down.

1250
01:27:40,910 --> 01:27:45,205
Fuck-face, who's speaking to you?
He asked him, didn't he?

1251
01:27:45,415 --> 01:27:48,041
Fuck-face? I like that one, Errol.

1252
01:27:48,251 --> 01:27:50,711
I'll remember that next time
I climb off your mum.

1253
01:27:50,920 --> 01:27:54,256
- Not now.
- Gonna be a tragedy of a fight.

1254
01:27:54,465 --> 01:27:57,384
Be a nice one.
Hell of a way to war.

1255
01:27:57,594 --> 01:27:59,094
And they're none of yours.

1256
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:04,266
There's a camp full of pikeys
that might not think you're so funny.

1257
01:28:04,475 --> 01:28:07,895
Not when they're putting out flames
on their children's backs.

1258
01:28:09,314 --> 01:28:11,273
Now get up and have a fucking fight.

1259
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:20,782
Three rounds and you're a vegetable,
aren't you, pikey!

1260
01:29:11,209 --> 01:29:14,336
I'm in charge here.
No fucking about, no eye-gouging.

1261
01:29:14,545 --> 01:29:16,713
Do your worst. Let's get it on!

1262
01:29:48,204 --> 01:29:51,248
What the fuck's going on?
You gonna finish him or what?

1263
01:30:33,249 --> 01:30:35,250
Talk about saved by the bell.

1264
01:30:35,793 --> 01:30:39,338
Do you understand the consequences
of knocking that man out?

1265
01:30:39,547 --> 01:30:41,840
Do not knock him out, Mickey.

1266
01:30:48,431 --> 01:30:50,182
All right, let's break it up.

1267
01:31:24,175 --> 01:31:25,634
What, is he fucking deaf?

1268
01:31:27,053 --> 01:31:28,845
What is he doing?

1269
01:31:44,612 --> 01:31:45,987
Come on and sit.

1270
01:31:48,741 --> 01:31:50,742
What the fuck are you doing, Mickey?

1271
01:31:50,952 --> 01:31:53,078
You're dancing like a fairy.

1272
01:31:53,329 --> 01:31:55,997
They'll hang us
if they think it's rigged.

1273
01:31:56,749 --> 01:31:58,917
Get out there and hurt him.

1274
01:32:00,294 --> 01:32:05,215
But for fuck's sake,
do not knock him out.

1275
01:33:25,505 --> 01:33:28,423
All he's got to do is stay down.

1276
01:33:32,970 --> 01:33:35,180
Now, we are fucked.

1277
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:44,439
He can't stand up.

1278
01:33:44,649 --> 01:33:45,649
We're out of here.

1279
01:33:45,816 --> 01:33:50,862
Stupid pikey knows Brick Top's got
keen-to-kill monkeys with shotguns...

1280
01:33:51,072 --> 01:33:53,281
...sitting outside his campsite.

1281
01:33:53,491 --> 01:33:58,745
Once the campsite's wiped out,
I know it's gonna be the same for us.

1282
01:34:01,290 --> 01:34:03,250
Ever cross the road
and look the wrong way?

1283
01:34:03,459 --> 01:34:04,918
Give me that fucking shooter!

1284
01:34:05,127 --> 01:34:07,671
And, hey, presto,
there's a car nearly on you.

1285
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:09,047
So, what do you do?

1286
01:34:09,632 --> 01:34:11,716
Something very silly.

1287
01:34:12,093 --> 01:34:14,970
You freeze. And your life
doesn't flash before you...

1288
01:34:15,221 --> 01:34:17,806
...because you're too scared
to think.

1289
01:34:17,974 --> 01:34:21,142
You just freeze
and pull a stupid face.

1290
01:34:21,310 --> 01:34:23,603
But the pikey didn't. Why?

1291
01:34:23,813 --> 01:34:26,648
Because he had plans
on running the car over.

1292
01:34:28,985 --> 01:34:31,152
It had previously occurred to me...

1293
01:34:31,445 --> 01:34:34,364
...that he'd taken the demise
of his mother rather lightly.

1294
01:34:38,119 --> 01:34:40,912
For every action,
there is a reaction.

1295
01:34:41,497 --> 01:34:43,039
And a pikey reaction...

1296
01:34:43,708 --> 01:34:45,083
...is quite a fucking thing.

1297
01:35:27,084 --> 01:35:29,169
Pete, talk to me.

1298
01:35:29,378 --> 01:35:33,006
If you want your friend to hear you,
talk a lot louder than that.

1299
01:35:41,891 --> 01:35:45,560
- Give me that fucking shooter.
- I'll give you your shooter, you cunt.

1300
01:35:53,527 --> 01:35:57,238
That is when I thought the pikey
had money riding on himself.

1301
01:35:58,240 --> 01:36:01,743
That's why the bastard never
goes down when he's supposed to.

1302
01:36:03,537 --> 01:36:05,246
We've been tucked up...

1303
01:36:06,916 --> 01:36:08,583
...while he's been cleaning up.

1304
01:36:10,628 --> 01:36:13,254
We're worse off now than
when we started.

1305
01:36:18,761 --> 01:36:21,262
The next day we went
to the campsite...

1306
01:36:21,430 --> 01:36:24,599
...but the gypsies had disappeared
during the night.

1307
01:36:24,809 --> 01:36:26,810
Which was probably a good thing...

1308
01:36:27,103 --> 01:36:31,314
...considering they'd just buried
12 people somewhere in the area.

1309
01:36:31,524 --> 01:36:33,149
Where is he?

1310
01:36:33,359 --> 01:36:35,610
He ain't fucking here,
that's for sure.

1311
01:36:36,320 --> 01:36:39,864
We can't ask a man to fight for us
if we can't find him, can we?

1312
01:36:40,074 --> 01:36:43,410
You won't find a pikey that
doesn't want to be found.

1313
01:36:45,287 --> 01:36:48,540
He could be in a campsite
in Kampu-fucking-chea by now.

1314
01:36:50,126 --> 01:36:51,960
Bollocks! Come on.

1315
01:36:57,216 --> 01:37:00,385
- What you doing here?
- What's it got to do with you?

1316
01:37:03,889 --> 01:37:06,057
So, what you doing here?

1317
01:37:13,649 --> 01:37:16,901
I'm taking the dog for a walk.
What's the problem?

1318
01:37:18,446 --> 01:37:19,487
What's in the car?

1319
01:37:19,989 --> 01:37:21,614
Seats and a steering wheel.

1320
01:37:22,450 --> 01:37:24,284
What do you know about gypsies?

1321
01:37:26,036 --> 01:37:28,037
I know they're not to be trusted.

1322
01:37:30,082 --> 01:37:32,834
All right, get your dog. On your way.

1323
01:37:33,627 --> 01:37:35,170
Get the dog, Tommy.

1324
01:37:37,256 --> 01:37:38,548
The dog.

1325
01:37:39,842 --> 01:37:44,387
All right, boy. Come on.
Come on, Daisy. No, Daisy!

1326
01:37:45,347 --> 01:37:47,182
He loves that dog.

1327
01:37:47,349 --> 01:37:49,184
Always playing silly games.

1328
01:37:49,351 --> 01:37:52,854
Stop messing about
and get it in the car. Tommy!

1329
01:37:55,441 --> 01:37:59,402
Good boy. Good boy.
Good boy, Daisy, good boy.

1330
01:38:10,206 --> 01:38:11,706
Could you tell me...

1331
01:38:11,874 --> 01:38:15,210
...why you got a dead man
with an arm missing in your boot?

1332
01:38:15,878 --> 01:38:16,878
Hey, George...

1333
01:38:18,214 --> 01:38:20,423
...is that a tea cozy on his head?

1334
01:38:23,803 --> 01:38:26,304
Oh, you love a dog, don't you, Tommy?

1335
01:38:36,148 --> 01:38:38,733
Tommy persuaded me
to keep the dog.

1336
01:38:38,943 --> 01:38:42,237
I eventually agreed,
as long as he took it to a vet.

1337
01:38:42,404 --> 01:38:45,323
I couldn't stand
that squeaking anymore.

1338
01:38:45,574 --> 01:38:48,993
The vet found half an undigested
shoe, a squeaky toy...

1339
01:38:49,245 --> 01:38:52,580
...and an 84-karat diamond
lodged in its stomach.

1340
01:38:52,748 --> 01:38:55,625
It's quite amazing what can happen
in a week.

1341
01:38:56,001 --> 01:38:58,002
Still didn't shut it up, though.

1342
01:38:58,921 --> 01:39:00,588
So, what do you do?

1343
01:39:00,756 --> 01:39:03,883
You go see the man that knows
about these sort of things.

1344
01:39:04,093 --> 01:39:05,760
So, what do you think?

1345
01:39:07,388 --> 01:39:09,681
Do you know anyone
who'd be interested?

1346
01:39:14,478 --> 01:39:15,478
I might.

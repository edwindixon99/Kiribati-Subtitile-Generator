1
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,470
The Hovitos are near.

2
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,057
The poison is still fresh,
three days.

3
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,808
They're following us.

4
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,813
If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.

5
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,859
This is it.

6
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,819
This is where Forrestal
cashed in.

7
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,071
- A friend of yours?
- A competitor.

8
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,782
He was good.

9
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,492
He was very, very good.

10
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,413
Señor, nobody's
come out of there alive.

11
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,498
Please...

12
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,453
Señor.

13
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,691
Stop.

14
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,819
Stay out of the light.

15
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,884
Forrestal.

16
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,600
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

17
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,146
That's what scares me.

18
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,333
Stay here.

19
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,168
If you insist, señor.

20
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,922
Give me the whip.

21
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,215
Throw me the idol.

22
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,927
No time to argue.

23
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,095
Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip.

24
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,889
Give me the whip!

25
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,641
Adiós, señor.

26
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,478
Adiós, Satipo.

27
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,478
Dr. Jones.

28
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,356
Again we see there is nothing
you can possess

29
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,066
which I cannot take away.

30
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,068
And you thought I had given up.

31
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,916
You chose the wrong friends.
This time, it will cost you.

32
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:33,841
Too bad the Hovitos
don't know you the way I do, Belloq.

33
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,926
Yes, too bad.

34
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,764
You could warn them,
if only you spoke Hovitos.

35
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,146
Jock! Start the engines!

36
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,939
Get it up!

37
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,820
Jock, the engines!

38
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,281
Start the engines, Jock!

39
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,041
There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!

40
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,378
Oh, that's just
my pet snake Reggie!

41
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,005
I hate snakes, Jock!

42
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,215
I hate 'em!

43
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,218
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?

44
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,278
"Neo," meaning "new"

45
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:03,073
and "Lithic"... "I-T-H"...

46
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,993
"...I-C," meaning "stone."

47
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,786
All right, let's get back to this site:

48
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,454
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.

49
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,334
Contains a central passage
and three chambers, or cysts...

50
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,218
...don't confuse that
with robbing, in which case we mean

51
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,305
the removal of the contents
of the barrow.

52
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,307
This site also demonstrates...

53
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,978
...one of the great dangers
of archeology,

54
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,231
not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place.

55
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,650
No, I'm talking about folklore.

56
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,444
In this case,
local tradition held

57
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,989
that there was a golden coffin
buried at the site,

58
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,326
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow

59
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,703
and the generally poor condition
of the find.

60
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,706
However, chamber three
was undisturbed,

61
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,416
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods

62
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,917
that were found in another, uh...

63
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,337
in the area, give us a r...

64
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,548
Uh...

65
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,969
...reason to da...
to, uh, to-to date this,

66
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,679
uh, find as we have.

67
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,805
Um...

68
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,140
Any questions, then?

69
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,726
No? Okay, that's it
for the day, then.

70
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,479
Um, don't forget...

71
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,358
Michaelson, chapters four
and five for next time.

72
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,152
And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

73
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,330
I had it, Marcus.

74
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,707
I had it in my hand.

75
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,626
- What happened?
- Guess.

76
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,546
- Belloq?
- You want to hear about it?

77
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,215
Not at all.

78
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,092
I'm sure everything you do
for the museum

79
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,303
conforms to the International Treaty
for the Protection of Antiquities.

80
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,638
It's beautiful, Marcus.

81
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,640
I can get it.
I got it all figured out.

82
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,350
There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.

83
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,726
I need $2,000. Look...

84
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,894
Listen to me, old boy.

85
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,354
I brought some people
to see you.

86
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,438
Look.

87
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,606
I got these pieces.

88
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,941
They're good pieces, Marcus.

89
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,068
- Look.
- Indiana...

90
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,196
Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.

91
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,739
- Yes, they are nice.
- They're worth at least

92
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,157
the price
of a ticket to Marrakech.

93
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,492
But the people
I brought are important,

94
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,952
- and they're waiting.
- What people?

95
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,912
Army Intelligence.

96
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,622
They knew you were coming
before I did.

97
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,165
Seem to know everything.

98
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,251
They wouldn't tell me
what they want.

99
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,336
Well, what do I want
to see them for?

100
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,338
What am I, in trouble?

101
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,798
Yes, Dr. Jones,

102
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,341
we've heard a great deal
about you.

103
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,135
Have you?

104
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,429
Uh, professor of archeology,

105
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,180
expert on the occult,

106
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,807
and, uh, how does one say it?

107
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,560
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

108
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,769
That's one way of saying it.

109
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,104
Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.

110
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,689
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

111
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,067
Yes, you're a man
of many talents.

112
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,486
Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood

113
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,280
at the University of Chicago.

114
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,615
Yes, I did.

115
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,243
You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?

116
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,621
Uh... well, just rumors, really.

117
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,373
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

118
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,125
I haven't really spoken
to him for ten years.

119
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,794
We were friends, but, uh...

120
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,088
had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.

121
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,339
Mmm.

122
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,967
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand

123
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,761
that this is all
strictly confidential, eh?

124
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:12,804
I understand.

125
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,265
Uh...

126
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,894
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections

127
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,730
intercepted a...
a German communiqué

128
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,232
that was sent
from Cairo to Berlin.

129
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,610
- Now, to Cairo...
- See, over the last two years,

130
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,695
the Nazis have had teams
of archeologists

131
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,741
running around the world looking
for all kinds of religious artifacts.

132
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,367
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

133
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,494
He's crazy.

134
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,621
He's obsessed with the occult.

135
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,331
And, right now, apparently,

136
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,833
there's some kind
of German archeological dig

137
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,002
going on in the desert
outside of Cairo.

138
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,587
Now, we've got some
information here,

139
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,215
but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.

140
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,177
"Tanis development proceeding.

141
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:56,473
"Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

142
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,725
"Abner Ravenwood, U.S."

143
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,395
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

144
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,565
Just what does that mean to you,
uh, Tanis?

145
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,691
Well, it...

146
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,194
The city of Tanis is one of the possible
resting places of the Lost Ark.

147
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,946
The Lost Ark?

148
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,280
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

149
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,532
The chest the Hebrews used

150
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,950
to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

151
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,117
What do you mean,
"commandments"?

152
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,702
You talking
about the Ten Commandments?

153
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,871
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

154
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,456
The original stone tablets

155
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,500
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

156
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,627
if you believe
in that sort of thing.

157
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,588
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

158
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,674
- Well, I...
- Oh, look.

159
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,342
The Hebrews took
the broken pieces

160
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,803
and put them in the Ark.
When they settled in Canaan,

161
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,514
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

162
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,640
In Jerusalem.

163
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,225
Where it stayed for many years.

164
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,394
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

165
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,645
Where?

166
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,605
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

167
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,566
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

168
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,650
- Shishak.
- Yes.

169
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,486
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

170
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,531
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

171
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,533
and hidden it
in a secret chamber

172
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,867
called the Well of Souls.

173
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,536
Secret chamber?

174
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,246
However, about a year

175
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,498
after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,

176
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,835
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

177
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,005
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

178
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,340
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

179
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,094
Uh-huh.

180
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,887
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

181
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,514
Now you seem to know, uh,

182
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,849
all about this Tanis, then.

183
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,350
No, no, not really.

184
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,853
Ravenwood is the real expert.

185
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,938
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

186
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,566
Collected some of its relics.

187
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,444
It was his obsession, really.

188
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,862
But he never found the city.

189
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,282
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

190
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,034
An American being mentioned
so prominently

191
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,286
in a secret Nazi cable.

192
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,705
Oh, rubbish.
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

193
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,540
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

194
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,084
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking

195
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,961
for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra

196
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,255
and they think Abner's got it.

197
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,008
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

198
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,593
Well, the staff
is just a stick...

199
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,927
I don't know, about this big,

200
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,763
nobody really knows
for sure how high...

201
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,849
And it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

202
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,435
with an elaborate headpiece...

203
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,480
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

204
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,148
And what you did was

205
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,984
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis...

206
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,402
A map room with a miniature

207
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,904
of the city all laid out
on the floor,

208
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,989
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

209
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,950
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

210
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,788
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

211
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,791
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

212
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,293
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

213
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,629
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

214
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,964
What does this Ark look like?

215
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,383
Uh...

216
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,760
There's a picture of it
right here.

217
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,266
That's it.

218
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,108
Good God.

219
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,735
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

220
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,195
Uh...

221
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,739
now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

222
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,491
Lightning...

223
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,535
fire...

224
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,787
power of God or something.

225
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,665
I'm beginning to understand

226
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,166
Hitler's interest in this.

227
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,626
Oh, yes.

228
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,878
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

229
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,465
and laying waste
to entire regions.

230
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,428
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

231
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,971
is invincible.

232
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,535
You did it, didn't you?

233
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,245
They want you to go for it.

234
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,748
Oh, Marcus!

235
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,542
They want you to get a hold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

236
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,794
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

237
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,045
And the museum?

238
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,380
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

239
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,840
Oh, yes.

240
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,386
Oh...

241
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,513
The Ark of the Covenant.

242
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,266
Nothing else has come close.

243
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,559
That thing represents everything

244
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,062
we got into archeology
for in the first place.

245
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,815
Mmm!

246
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,485
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.

247
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,779
I'm really rather envious.

248
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,947
I've got to locate Abner.

249
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,699
I think I know where to start.

250
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,790
Suppose she'll
still be with him?

251
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,792
Possibly, but...

252
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,919
Marion's the least
of your worries right now,

253
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,629
believe me, Indy.

254
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,672
What do you mean?

255
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,550
Well, I mean that
for nearly 3,000 years,

256
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,763
man has been searching
for the Lost Ark.

257
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:50,600
Not something to be taken
lightly.

258
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,646
No one knows its secrets.

259
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,107
It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.

260
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,193
Oh, Marcus.

261
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,778
What are you trying to do,
scare me?

262
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,862
You sound like my mother.

263
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,322
We've known each other
for a long time.

264
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,992
I don't believe in magic,
a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus.

265
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,202
I'm going after a find

266
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,037
of incredible
historical significance.

267
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,997
You're talking
about the bogeyman.

268
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,667
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

269
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,054
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.

270
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,138
Thank you.

271
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,463
Shh... shh...

272
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:02,649
Shh...

273
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,307
Give him space!
Give him space!

274
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,850
Go on, Regan!

275
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,146
Shh! Shh!

276
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,690
Shh! Shh! Shh!

277
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,819
Hello, Marion.

278
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,453
Indiana Jones.

279
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,999
Always knew, someday,

280
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,126
you'd come walking back
through my door.

281
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,462
I never doubted that.

282
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,839
Something made it inevitable.

283
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,425
So, what are you doing here
in Nepal?

284
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,428
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

285
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:59,891
I learned to hate you
in the last ten years.

286
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,309
I never meant to hurt you.

287
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,435
I was a child.

288
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,728
I was in love.

289
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,480
It was wrong and you knew it!

290
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:06,856
You knew what you were doing.

291
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,483
Now I do!
This is my place.

292
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,817
Get out!

293
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,322
I did what I did.

294
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,490
You don't have to be happy
about it,

295
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,450
but maybe we could help
each other out now.

296
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,412
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

297
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,663
Bronze piece, about this size,

298
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,916
with a hole in it, off-center,
with a crystal.

299
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,084
You know the one I mean?

300
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,794
Yeah.

301
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,087
I know it.

302
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,214
Where's Abner?

303
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,716
Where's Abner?

304
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,009
Abner's dead.

305
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,101
Marion, I'm sorry.

306
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,603
Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?

307
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,231
I can only say
I'm sorry so many times.

308
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,149
Well, say it again, anyway.

309
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,275
Sorry.

310
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,486
Yeah, everybody's sorry.

311
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,446
Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth

312
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,198
looking
for his little bits of junk.

313
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,617
I'm sorry to still be
stuck in this dive.

314
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:03,079
Everybody's sorry for something.

315
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,956
It's a worthless bronze
medallion, Marion.

316
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,082
You going to give it to me?

317
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,166
Maybe.

318
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,001
I don't know where it is.

319
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:12,505
Well, maybe you could find it.

320
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,716
3,000 bucks.

321
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,762
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

322
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,223
I can get you another two
when we get to the States.

323
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,058
It's important, Marion.

324
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,686
Trust me.

325
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,647
You know the piece I mean?

326
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,399
Do you know where it is?

327
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:35,987
Come back tomorrow.

328
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,531
Why?

329
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,450
Because I said so, that's why.

330
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,750
Ha!

331
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,961
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

332
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,240
Good evening, Fräulein.

333
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,950
The bar's closed.

334
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,078
We... We are...

335
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,080
not thirsty.

336
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,873
What do you want?

337
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,751
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.

338
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,128
Surely he told you
there would be

339
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,339
other interested parties.

340
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,758
Must've slipped his mind.

341
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,095
The man is... nefarious.

342
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,432
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

343
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,768
Why, are you willing
to offer more?

344
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:34,105
Oh, almost certainly.

345
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,815
Do you still have it?

346
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,822
No.

347
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,741
But I know where it is.

348
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,620
Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?

349
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:54,625
Your fire is dying here.

350
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,461
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

351
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,047
Listen, Herr Mac...

352
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,427
I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with,

353
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,929
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

354
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,558
Fräulein Ravenwood,

355
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,520
let me show you
what I am used to.

356
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,026
Take your hands off me!

357
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,779
Take your lousy hands off!

358
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:31,746
Wait a minute.

359
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,164
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.

360
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,832
That time is passed.

361
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,584
You don't need that.

362
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:39,879
Wait...

363
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,758
I'll tell you everything.

364
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,677
Yes, I know you will.

365
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,185
Let her go.

366
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,428
Whiskey.

367
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,646
Shoot them.

368
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,523
Shoot them both.

369
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,871
My medallion!

370
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:29,048
Well, Jones, at least
you haven't forgotten

371
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,925
how to show a lady a good time!

372
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,593
Boy, you're something!

373
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,844
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

374
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,721
Until I get back my $5,000,

375
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,890
you're going to get more
than you bargained for.

376
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,434
I'm your goddamn partner!

377
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,724
Cairo, city of the living.

378
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,560
A paradise on earth.

379
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,521
Silence!

380
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,106
Why do you forget yourselves?

381
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,607
What is this?

382
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,484
Where did this animal come from?

383
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,114
Oh... oh, no.

384
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,451
Cute.

385
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,328
What an adorable creature.

386
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,583
Then it shall be welcome
in our house.

387
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,918
Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.

388
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,721
I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.

389
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,931
You're the best digger in Egypt.

390
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:04,143
My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.

391
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,313
They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.

392
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,148
The excavation is enormous.

393
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:14,028
They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.

394
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,488
It's as if the pharaohs
had returned.

395
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,365
When did they find the map room?

396
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,992
Three days ago.

397
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,328
They have not one brain
among them.

398
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,371
Except one.

399
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,540
He is very clever.
He's a French archeologist.

400
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,210
What's his name?

401
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,545
They call him "Bellosh."

402
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,220
Belloq. Belloq.

403
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,350
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

404
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,727
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

405
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:51,565
Well, they're not
going to find it without this.

406
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,610
Who can tell us
about these markings?

407
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,281
Perhaps a man I know
can help us.

408
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,077
Indy...

409
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,872
there is something
that troubles me.

410
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,000
What is it?

411
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,127
The Ark.

412
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,505
If it is there, at Tanis,

413
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,883
then it is something that
man was not meant to disturb.

414
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,136
Death has always surrounded it.

415
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,097
It is not of this earth.

416
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,932
Do we need the monkey, huh?

417
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,517
I'm surprised at you, Jones,

418
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,228
talking that way about our baby.

419
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,021
He's got your looks, too.

420
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,106
And your brains.

421
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,024
Oops!

422
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,192
I noticed that.

423
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,820
She's a smart little thing.
Smart.

424
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,740
Hey!

425
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,033
Hey, where you going?

426
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,910
She'll be all right.
Have a date.

427
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:49,957
Come on. Come on.

428
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,959
- Okay...
- Marion.

429
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,043
What's this?

430
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,461
It's a date.

431
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,754
You eat 'em.

432
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,181
How come you haven't found some
nice girl to settle down with,

433
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,141
raise eight or nine kids,
like your friend Sallah?

434
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,392
Who says I haven't?

435
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,270
I do.

436
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,189
Dad had you figured
a long time ago.

437
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,074
He said you were a bum.

438
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,493
Oh, he's being generous.

439
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,578
The most gifted bum
he ever trained.

440
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,789
You know, he loved you
like a son.

441
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,415
Took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him.

442
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,708
Not much, just you.

443
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,186
Marion, get out of here!

444
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,729
Duck!

445
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:18,897
Right.

446
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,442
Shh! Shh!

447
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,991
Marion!

448
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,513
Help! Over here, Indy!

449
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,640
Get out of the way!

450
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,183
Move! Move it!

451
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,518
Help me!

452
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,525
You can't do this to me!

453
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,277
I'm an American!

454
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,696
Indy!

455
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,368
Indiana Jones!

456
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,953
Help me, Jones!

457
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,392
Jones!

458
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,476
Marion!

459
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,190
Indy!

460
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,358
Marion...

461
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,147
Dr. Jones.

462
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,717
You looking for me?

463
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,061
Belloq.

464
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,771
Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.

465
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,731
I ought to kill you right now.

466
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,442
Not a very private place
for a murder.

467
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,196
Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.

468
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,491
They're not going
to interfere in our business.

469
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,119
It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.

470
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,329
Please, sit down
before you fall down.

471
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,040
We can at least behave
like civilized people.

472
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,387
I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.

473
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,390
How odd that it should end
this way for us,

474
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,393
after so many
stimulating encounters.

475
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,353
I almost regret it.

476
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,980
Where shall I find
a new adversary

477
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,731
so close to my own level?

478
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,859
Try the local sewer.

479
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,656
You and I are very much alike.

480
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,075
Archeology is our religion,

481
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,329
yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.

482
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,000
Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend.

483
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,253
I am a shadowy
reflection of you.

484
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,464
It would take only a nudge
to make you like me,

485
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,842
to push you out of the light.

486
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,345
Now you're getting nasty.

487
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,389
You know it's true.

488
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,433
How nice.

489
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,518
Look at this.

490
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,437
It's worthless.

491
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,731
Ten dollars
from a vendor in the street.

492
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,940
But I take it,

493
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,692
I bury it in the sand
for a thousand years,

494
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:59,362
it becomes priceless...
Like the Ark.

495
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,323
Men will kill for it.

496
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:04,117
Men like you and me.

497
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:07,704
What about your boss,
der Führer?

498
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:11,208
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

499
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,835
All in good time.

500
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,962
When I am finished with it.

501
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,674
Jones, do you realize
what the Ark is?

502
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,635
It's a transmitter.

503
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,512
It's a radio
for speaking to God.

504
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,264
And it's within my reach.

505
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:31,728
You want to talk to God?

506
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,855
Let's go see Him together.

507
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,565
I've got nothing better to do.

508
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,777
Uncle Indy, come back home now!

509
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:41,988
Uncle Indy!

510
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,116
Next time, Indiana Jones,

511
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,327
it'll take more than children
to save you.

512
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,580
Uncle Indy!

513
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,263
I thought I would
find you there.

514
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,598
Better than the United
States Marines, eh?

515
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,026
Marion's dead.

516
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,529
- Yes, I know.
- And me! And me!

517
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,239
I'm sorry.

518
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,908
Life goes on, Indy.

519
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,702
There is the proof.

520
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,162
Uh-oh.

521
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,915
I have much to tell you.

522
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,251
First we will take them home,

523
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,627
and then I will take you
to the old man.

524
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,056
I can't figure out
how Belloq did it.

525
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,558
Where'd he get a copy
of the headpiece?

526
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,895
There are no pictures,
no duplicates of it anywhere.

527
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,397
I tell you only what I saw
with my own eyes:

528
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:41,066
A headpiece like that one,

529
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,651
except round the edges,
which were rougher.

530
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,779
In the center, the Frenchman
had embedded a crystal,

531
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:50,283
and... and surrounding
the crystal, on one side,

532
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,452
there were raised markings,
just like that one.

533
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,207
They made their calculations
in the map room?

534
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,666
This morning.

535
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,127
Belloq and the boss German,
Dietrich.

536
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,797
When they came out
of the map room,

537
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,132
they gave us a new spot
in which to dig,

538
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,968
out away from the camp.

539
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,012
The Well of the Souls, huh?

540
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:14,933
Come, come, look.
Look here... Look.

541
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,559
Sit down.

542
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,144
Come, sit down.

543
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,480
What is it?

544
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,399
This is a warning

545
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:24,901
not to disturb
the Ark of the Covenant.

546
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,820
What about the height
of the staff, though?

547
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,071
Did Belloq get it off of here?

548
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,240
Yes. It is here.

549
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,117
This were the old way,

550
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,661
this mean six kadam high.

551
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,954
- About 72 inches.
- Wait!

552
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,335
"And take back one kadam

553
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,339
to honor the Hebrew God
whose Ark this is."

554
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,437
You said their headpiece
only had markings on one side.

555
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,439
Are you absolutely sure?

556
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,817
Belloq's staff is too long.

557
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,570
They're digging
in the wrong place.

558
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,783
I am the monarch of the sea

559
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,743
I am the ruler of the...

560
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,339
Bad dates.

561
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,607
I told you not to be premature

562
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,984
in your communiqué to Berlin.

563
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,905
Archeology is not
an exact science.

564
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,157
It does not deal
in time schedules.

565
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,867
The Führer is not
a patient man.

566
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,162
He demands constant reports,
and he expects progress.

567
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,330
You led me to believe...

568
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,207
Nothing!
I made no promises.

569
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,501
I only said
it looked very favorable.

570
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,587
Besides, with the information
in our possession,

571
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,255
my calculations were correct.

572
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,549
Boy, they're not kidding,
are they?

573
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,345
What time does the sun
hit the map room?

574
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,388
At about 9:00 in the morning.

575
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,265
Not much time, then.

576
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,434
Where are they digging
for the Well of the Souls?

577
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,646
On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.

578
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,064
Let's go, come on.

579
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,020
Sallah.

580
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,106
Sallah!

581
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,032
They're here.

582
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,252
Please, my friend,
what is the matter?

583
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:00,046
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.

584
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,383
If you want water,
I will get you water.

585
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,760
No problem, no problem.

586
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,151
I thought you were dead.

587
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,736
You must have switched baskets.

588
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,200
Are you hurt?

589
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,661
No. You have to get me
out of here, quick.

590
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,704
They're gonna be back
at any minute.

591
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,289
Cut me loose.

592
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:36,374
Quick.

593
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,001
They keep asking about you.
What you know.

594
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,007
What's wrong?

595
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,175
Cut me loose.

596
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,593
I know where the Ark is, Marion.

597
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,761
The Ark's here?

598
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,514
I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here!

599
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,932
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!

600
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,058
If I take you out of here now,

601
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,601
they'll start combing
the place for us.

602
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,186
Jones, you've got to get me
out of here!

603
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,647
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?

604
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,858
Marion, I hate to do this,

605
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,527
but if you don't sit
still and keep quiet,

606
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,696
this whole thing
is going to be shot.

607
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,365
I'll be back to get you.

608
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,325
Jones, what's the matter?

609
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:58,623
That's it.

610
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,458
Who knows?

611
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,251
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting

612
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,087
in some antechamber
for us to discover.

613
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:08,382
Perhaps there's some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us.

614
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,927
- Perhaps...
- Perhaps the girl can help us.

615
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,386
My feeling exactly.

616
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,889
She was in possession
of the original piece for years.

617
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,683
She may know much,
if properly motivated.

618
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,102
I tell you,
the girl knows nothing.

619
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,064
I'm surprised
to find you squeamish.

620
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,107
That is not your reputation.

621
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,484
But it needn't concern you.

622
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,778
I have the perfect man
for this kind of work.

623
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,868
Heil Hitler.

624
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,869
Indy! Here!

625
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,328
We've hit stone!

626
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,209
Clear it off.

627
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,669
Come on, find the edges.

628
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:26,771
Good, good, good.

629
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,147
You see, Indy? You see?

630
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,149
Okay, bring the pry bars in.

631
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,901
As a team, boys! As a team!

632
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,112
Push!

633
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,911
Get 'em in there.
Get 'em under.

634
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,204
Good, good, that's it.

635
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:44,705
Watch your toes.

636
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:53,756
Carefully, carefully!

637
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:07,812
Sorry, Indy.

638
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,731
Indy...

639
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,025
why does the floor move?

640
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,821
Give me your torch.

641
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,270
Snakes.

642
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,313
Why did it have to be snakes?

643
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:57,153
Asps.

644
01:00:57,279 --> 01:01:00,072
Very dangerous.

645
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,574
You go first.

646
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:23,053
If you're trying
to escape on foot,

647
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:26,056
the desert is three weeks
in every direction,

648
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,058
so please, eat something.

649
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,109
I must apologize
for their treatment of you.

650
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,402
Yeah. Whose idea was it?

651
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,612
No food, no water.

652
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:42,156
What kind of people
are these friends of yours?

653
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,533
At this particular time
and place, to do my work,

654
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,619
they are necessary evils.

655
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,329
They're not my friends.

656
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:51,248
However, with the
right connections,

657
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,708
even in this part of the world,

658
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,920
we are not entirely uncivilized.

659
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:58,589
It's beautiful.

660
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,550
I would very much like
to see you in it.

661
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,763
I'll bet you would.

662
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,977
All right.

663
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,487
What do you got to drink
around here?

664
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,742
We don't have much time.

665
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,577
Soon they will come to harm you,

666
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,746
and I will not be able
to stop them,

667
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,499
unless you are able
to give me something

668
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,501
to placate them.

669
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:39,171
Some, uh, piece
of information...

670
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,298
which I can use
to protect you from them.

671
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,093
I've already told you
everything I know.

672
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,595
I have no loyalty to Jones.

673
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,806
He's brought me
nothing but trouble.

674
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,189
Marion, you are beautiful.

675
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,363
I don't think
we need a chaperone.

676
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,452
Steadily.

677
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:11,954
Steadily. Whoa!

678
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,666
Down...

679
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,001
Down... Whoa.

680
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,210
Carefully, carefully!

681
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,296
You all right, Indy?

682
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:26,719
Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently!

683
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,270
Whoa...

684
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,324
I told you it will be all right.

685
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:06,258
Huh...

686
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,393
Sallah, get down here!

687
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,623
You pour.

688
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,946
Oh, that's good.

689
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:37,451
Whoops.

690
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,501
What is this stuff, René?

691
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,378
I grew up with this.

692
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:51,715
It's my family label.

693
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,665
Well... I have to be
going now, René.

694
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:29,127
I like you, René, very much.

695
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,464
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

696
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,971
We meet again, Fräulein.

697
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,474
You Americans,
you're all the same.

698
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,437
Always overdressing
for the wrong occasions.

699
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:20,804
Now...

700
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:25,684
what shall we talk about?

701
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,390
All right... take it up!

702
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,225
Easy!

703
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,812
You're as stubborn as that girl.

704
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,773
You like her too much, I think.

705
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:58,193
Your methods of archeology
are too primitive for me.

706
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:03,115
You would use a bulldozer
to find a... china cup.

707
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:10,038
Colonel! Wake your men!

708
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,124
Indy, the torches
are burning out.

709
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,126
Go on, get out of here.

710
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,961
Hyah!

711
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:35,981
- Sallah!
- Hello!

712
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,233
Hello!

713
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,236
Why, Dr. Jones,
whatever are you doing

714
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,196
in such a nasty place?

715
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,365
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!

716
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,450
Thank you, my friend,

717
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:49,411
but I think we are all
very comfortable up here.

718
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:50,954
That's right, isn't it?

719
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:53,790
Yes, we are very comfortable
up here.

720
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,169
So, once again, Jones,

721
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,546
what was briefly yours
is now mine.

722
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,800
What a fitting end
to your life's pursuits.

723
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,761
You're about to become
a permanent addition

724
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:07,137
to this archeological find.

725
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,555
Who knows?

726
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,724
In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

727
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:14,603
Son of a bitch.

728
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,605
I'm afraid we must be
going now, Dr. Jones.

729
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,024
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.

730
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:20,442
But I do not wish to leave you

731
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,944
down in that awful place
all alone.

732
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:24,863
Slimy pig, you let me go!

733
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:26,865
Stop it!

734
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,952
Marion!

735
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,537
Hang on.

736
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:34,456
Don't...

737
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:35,832
- Indy!
- Don't fall!

738
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,918
Marion, I got you!
I got you! I got you!

739
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,382
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!

740
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:53,600
Snakes!

741
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,020
Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!

742
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,439
The girl was mine!

743
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:00,482
She's of no use to us.

744
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,275
Only our mission
for the Führer matters.

745
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,822
I wonder sometimes, monsieur,

746
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,241
if you have that
clearly in mind.

747
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,409
It was not to be, chérie.

748
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,120
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!

749
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:16,915
Indiana Jones...

750
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:17,999
adieu.

751
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,514
No!

752
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,108
Take this.

753
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,068
Wave it at anything
that slithers.

754
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,319
Thank you.

755
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,738
Oh, my God, this whole
place is slithering.

756
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:52,868
Indy!

757
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:54,452
Ow! Jesus!

758
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,791
Where did you get this?
From him?

759
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,334
I was trying to escape.

760
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,586
No thanks to you.

761
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,962
How hard were you trying?

762
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,213
Well, where the hell were you?

763
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,381
Watch it, watch it.

764
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:09,467
- What are you doing?
- For the fire!

765
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,221
How the hell are we going
to get out of here?

766
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,431
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!

767
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,266
Well, whatever you're
doing, do it faster.

768
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:21,980
Ah...

769
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,815
Where are you going?

770
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,358
Through that wall.

771
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:27,986
Just get ready to run,
whatever happens to me.

772
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,946
What do you mean by that?

773
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,501
Indy!

774
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,504
Damn it! Don't you leave me
down here by myself!

775
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:12,948
Indy!

776
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,199
Here we go!

777
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:15,450
Get ready!

778
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:19,412
Indy, the torch is going out!

779
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,621
Indy?

780
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,685
Marion!

781
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,021
Look. Look.

782
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,270
They're going to fly it
out of here.

783
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:08,480
When that Ark gets loaded,

784
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,939
we're already going
to be on the plane.

785
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:18,531
Ah, monsieur, let us toast
our success in the desert.

786
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:19,783
To the Ark.

787
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,826
When we are very far
from here.

788
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,620
That will do.

789
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:20,260
Hey, you now... Come here!

790
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,803
Come here!

791
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,369
Indy!

792
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,506
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!

793
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,513
Look out!

794
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,191
Oh, my God.

795
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,442
Marion.

796
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:44,195
In here! Up here!

797
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:47,657
Indy, come on!

798
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:48,825
Pull on the latch!

799
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,910
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!

800
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:56,291
It's stuck! Indy!

801
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:58,835
I can't force the lock!

802
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,574
It's stuck!

803
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,075
- Turn it! Turn it!
- It's stuck!

804
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,285
Turn it there!

805
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:33,995
Never mind!
Get back! Get back!

806
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,435
Get the Ark away from
this place immediately.

807
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,187
Have it put on the truck.

808
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,189
We'll fly it out of Cairo.

809
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:04,108
And Gobler, I want
plenty of protection.

810
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,492
Jones.

811
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,332
Holy smoke, my friends,

812
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,459
I... I'm so pleased
you're not dead!

813
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:24,754
Indy, Indy, we have no time.

814
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,214
If you still want the Ark,

815
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:28,674
it is being loaded
onto a truck for Cairo.

816
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,593
Truck?

817
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:31,928
What truck?

818
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,832
Let's go!

819
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,800
Get back to Cairo.

820
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,969
Get us some transport
to England...

821
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:16,013
boat, plane, anything.

822
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:18,307
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.

823
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:19,475
I'm going after that truck.

824
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,102
- How?
- I don't know.

825
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,437
I'm making this up as I go.

826
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,238
Ew!

827
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:24,840
He's there!

828
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,394
Idiot! Idiot!

829
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:06,150
Everything at last
has been arranged.

830
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,776
- The Ark?
- Is on board.

831
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:09,528
Nothing is lacking,
now that you're here.

832
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:10,905
Or what is left of you.

833
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:13,449
- You trust these guys?
- Yes.

834
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,911
Mr. Katanga.

835
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:22,583
Mr. Katanga,
these are my friends.

836
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,085
They are my family.

837
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:28,255
I will hear of it
if they are not treated well.

838
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,758
My cabin is theirs.

839
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,843
Mr. Jones...

840
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:35,429
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

841
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:37,890
Your appearance is exactly
the way I imagined.

842
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:44,855
Good-bye.

843
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:48,984
Look after each other.

844
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,111
I am already missing you.

845
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:55,157
You're my good friend.

846
01:30:57,827 --> 01:30:59,244
Sallah.

847
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:04,541
That is for Fayah...

848
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:07,753
that is for your children...

849
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:10,255
and this is for you.

850
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,220
Thank you.

851
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:30,734
A British tar is a soaring soul

852
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:34,822
As free as a mountain bird

853
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:39,118
His energetic fist
should be ready to...

854
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:43,205
...a dictator...

855
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:51,255
Where did you go?

856
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:53,132
I'm cleaning up.

857
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:56,427
Where'd you get that?

858
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:57,970
From him.

859
01:31:58,054 --> 01:31:59,304
Who him?

860
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:00,431
Katanga.

861
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:01,807
I got a feeling
I'm not the first woman

862
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:04,018
ever to travel
with these pirates.

863
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:06,353
It's lovely.

864
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:07,521
Yeah?

865
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:08,605
Yeah.

866
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:09,732
Really?

867
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:11,108
Yeah.

868
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:23,746
What'd you say?

869
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,421
Wait... I don't need any help.

870
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,299
You know you do.

871
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,762
You're not the man
I knew ten years ago.

872
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:43,265
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

873
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,439
You are...

874
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:53,025
Please, I don't need a nurse.

875
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:54,568
- I just want to sleep.
- Don't be such a baby.

876
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:55,819
Marion, leave me alone.

877
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:57,029
- What is this here?
- Go away.

878
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:59,615
Yes, it hurts.

879
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:00,741
Ow!

880
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:04,286
Well, goddamn it, Indy,
where doesn't it hurt?

881
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:06,163
Here.

882
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:13,420
Here.

883
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:23,847
This isn't too bad.

884
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:34,358
Here.

885
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:56,547
Jones...

886
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:00,801
Jones?

887
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:05,681
We never seem to get
a break, do we?

888
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:35,169
What is it?

889
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:38,130
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.

890
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:51,059
- What's happening?
- We have most important friends.

891
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:52,811
Holy shit.

892
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:56,773
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.

893
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:58,275
We have a place in the hold.
Come on, go, go, go.

894
01:34:58,359 --> 01:34:59,359
Come on, go, my friend, go.

895
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:14,208
Where is Dr. Jones?

896
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:15,626
What's the big idea?

897
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:17,127
Let go!

898
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:23,300
Don't you touch me.

899
01:36:08,054 --> 01:36:09,680
What about Jones?

900
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:11,348
There's no trace yet, sir.

901
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:12,808
Jones is dead.

902
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:17,187
I killed him.

903
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:19,690
He was of no use to us.

904
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:23,193
This girl, however, has certain
value where we're headed.

905
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,696
She'll bring a very good price.

906
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:28,031
Mmm?

907
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:33,036
Herr Colonel,
that cargo you've taken...

908
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:34,705
If it's your goal,
go in peace with it,

909
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:35,789
but leave us the girl.

910
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:36,957
It would reduce our loss
on this trip.

911
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:39,793
Savage!

912
01:36:39,877 --> 01:36:42,462
You are not in the position
to ask for anything.

913
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:44,965
We will take what we wish.

914
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:46,508
And then decide whether or not

915
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,510
to blow your ship
from the water.

916
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,389
The girl goes with me.

917
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:55,100
She'll be part
of my compensation.

918
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:58,186
I'm sure your Führer
would approve.

919
01:36:58,271 --> 01:36:59,604
If she fails to please me,

920
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:01,940
you may do with her as you wish.

921
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:05,027
I will waste
no more time with her now.

922
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:06,236
Excuse me.

923
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:23,837
I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.

924
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,505
I've looked everywhere.

925
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:28,008
He's got to be here somewhere.

926
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,259
Look again.

927
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:32,763
- I found him.
- Where?

928
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:34,097
There.

929
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:02,370
The altar has been
prepared in accordance

930
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:03,830
with your radio instructions,
sir.

931
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:04,956
Good.

932
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:06,958
Take the Ark there immediately.

933
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:11,046
Monsieur...

934
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:14,674
I am uncomfortable
with the thought

935
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:18,845
of this... Jewish ritual.

936
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:21,473
Are you sure it's necessary?

937
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,433
Let me ask you this:

938
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:27,103
Would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin,

939
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:29,189
for your Führer?

940
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:30,815
Finding out, only then,

941
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:33,652
if the sacred pieces
of the Covenant are inside?

942
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:34,861
Knowing, only then,

943
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:36,947
whether you have accomplished
your mission,

944
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:39,908
and obtained the one true Ark?

945
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:09,748
Hello!

946
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:13,752
Jones.

947
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:16,463
Jones!

948
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:18,381
I'm going to blow up the Ark,
René.

949
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:27,515
Your persistence
surprises even me.

950
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:31,561
You're going to give
mercenaries a bad name.

951
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:33,438
Dr. Jones...

952
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:38,777
surely you don't think you can
escape from this island.

953
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:41,237
That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

954
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:42,739
All I want is the girl.

955
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:49,788
If we refuse?

956
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:53,083
Then your Führer has no prize.

957
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:55,335
Okay, stand back.

958
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:56,670
All of you, stand back.

959
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:58,380
Stand back.

960
01:42:58,547 --> 01:43:00,340
Okay, Jones.

961
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:02,676
You win!

962
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,219
Blow it up.

963
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:13,478
Yes, blow it up!

964
01:43:13,562 --> 01:43:15,146
Blow it back to God.

965
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:17,691
All your life has been spent

966
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:20,360
in pursuit
of archeological relics.

967
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:24,114
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

968
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:27,158
You want to see it open
as well as I.

969
01:43:29,286 --> 01:43:31,287
Indiana...

970
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:34,124
we are simply passing
through history.

971
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:37,043
This...

972
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,297
This is history.

973
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:52,976
Do as you will.

974
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:30,425
Marion, don't look at it.

975
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:31,634
Shut your eyes, Marion.

976
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:33,219
Don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

977
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:46,357
Ah...

978
01:47:01,999 --> 01:47:03,666
It's beautiful!

979
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:15,678
Indy?

980
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:16,804
Don't look, Marion!

981
01:47:16,889 --> 01:47:18,139
Keep your eyes shut!

982
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:37,593
Marion.

983
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:13,713
You've done your country a
great service, and we thank you.

984
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:17,550
And we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

985
01:49:17,634 --> 01:49:18,718
Oh, the money's fine.

986
01:49:18,802 --> 01:49:20,470
The situation's
totally unacceptable.

987
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:22,889
Well, gentlemen,
I guess that just about wraps it up.

988
01:49:22,973 --> 01:49:26,893
Where is the Ark?

989
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:28,644
I thought we'd settled that.

990
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:31,439
The Ark is somewhere very safe.

991
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:32,648
From whom?

992
01:49:32,775 --> 01:49:35,401
The Ark is a source
of unspeakable power

993
01:49:35,486 --> 01:49:37,320
and it has to be researched.

994
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:40,615
And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody,

995
01:49:40,699 --> 01:49:42,241
Dr. Jones.

996
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:45,953
We have top men
working on it right now.

997
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:48,247
Who?

998
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:52,085
Top men.

999
01:49:55,297 --> 01:49:57,548
Hey, what happened?

1000
01:49:57,674 --> 01:49:58,758
You don't look very happy.

1001
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:01,677
- Fools. Bureaucratic fools.
- What'd they say?

1002
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:04,347
They don't know
what they've got there.

1003
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:07,058
Well, I know what I've got here.

1004
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:09,685
Come on.

1005
01:50:10,062 --> 01:50:11,521
I'll buy you a drink.

1006
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:14,774
You know...

1007
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:16,818
a drink?

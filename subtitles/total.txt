2
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:47,599
You Red Welby?

3
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,867
Yes, ma'am.
How may I help you?

4
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:50,969
Are you in charge
of renting

5
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:52,571
the three billboards out
on Drinkwater Road?

6
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:54,672
I didn't know we had
any billboards on...

7
00:03:54,674 --> 00:03:55,974
Where is Drinkwater Road?

8
00:03:55,976 --> 00:03:57,674
Past Sizemore turn-off.

9
00:03:57,676 --> 00:03:59,714
Nobody uses it since the
freeway got put in.

10
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,851
You're right.

11
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:09,053
We got three billboards
out there.

12
00:04:09,055 --> 00:04:13,158
Nobody's put nothing
up there since 1986.

13
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,358
That was Huggies.

14
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,896
How much to rent all three
of them out for the year?

15
00:04:17,563 --> 00:04:19,131
A year?

16
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,698
On a road
that no one goes down

17
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,934
unless they got lost
or they're retards...

18
00:04:22,936 --> 00:04:23,968
For a year?

19
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,306
Quick, ain't you, Welby?

20
00:04:27,306 --> 00:04:28,342
Well,

21
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:31,509
since what I say
goes these days

22
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:33,345
down at the Ebbing
Advertising Desk...

23
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,812
I'm gonna strike you
a real good deal.

24
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:37,381
What's your name?

25
00:04:37,383 --> 00:04:40,985
What's the law on what you can
and cannot say on a billboard?

26
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:43,388
Nothing defamatory,

27
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,323
and you can't say "fuck",
"piss" or "cunt". That right?

28
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,328
Uh...

29
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:49,930
Or...

30
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:51,696
Anus.

31
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:54,400
Well, I think
I'll be all right then.

32
00:04:57,037 --> 00:04:59,004
Here's 5,000
for the first month.

33
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:00,306
I assume that'll cover it.

34
00:05:01,275 --> 00:05:03,607
And here's what
they are to say.

35
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:04,842
Why don't you
write up a contract

36
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:06,278
betwixt us
while you're at it.

37
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,520
Make sure nobody rents them
billboards out from under me.

38
00:05:13,052 --> 00:05:15,186
I guess you're
Angela Hayes's mother.

39
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:18,359
That's right.
I'm Angela Hayes's mother.

40
00:05:24,898 --> 00:05:26,199
Name's Mildred.

41
00:05:28,068 --> 00:05:30,201
How long before
you get them put up?

42
00:05:31,503 --> 00:05:33,474
Shall we say by...

43
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,975
Easter Sunday?

44
00:05:37,044 --> 00:05:38,378
That would be perfect.

45
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:46,384
<i>  As I was walking
down the streets of Laredo  </i>

46
00:05:48,054 --> 00:05:53,225
<i>  As I walked down
to Laredo one day  </i>

47
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:58,595
<i> I spied a young cowboy
all wrapped in white linen  </i>

48
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:03,535
<i> All wrapped in white linen
and cold as the clay  </i>

49
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:22,821
Hey, what the hell
is this?

50
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,090
<i>Que?</i>

51
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:26,958
"How come,
Chief Willoughby" what?

52
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,559
- What?
- Yeah.

53
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:29,627
Huh?

54
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,694
"How come" what?

55
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:32,530
- What, what?
- What?

56
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:33,932
Listen,
you fucking beaner,

57
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:36,001
I'd better start getting
some straight answers.

58
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:37,304
Put that down.

59
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:08,232
What the hell is this?

60
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:10,901
Hey, you.
What the fuck is this?

61
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:12,304
What the fuck
is what?

62
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,341
This! This.

63
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:19,343
Advertising, I guess.

64
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:20,480
Advertising what?

65
00:07:27,854 --> 00:07:29,223
Something obscure?

66
00:07:29,989 --> 00:07:32,857
I'll say. Yeah.

67
00:07:32,859 --> 00:07:34,627
Don't I know your face
from some place?

68
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:37,127
I don't know, do you?

69
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,499
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

70
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:44,901
I could arrest you
right now...

71
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:46,037
For what?

72
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:47,237
For emptying your bucket.

73
00:07:47,239 --> 00:07:50,908
That's being bad against
the environment laws.

74
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:55,547
Well, before you do that,
Officer Dixon,

75
00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:56,915
how about
you have a look

76
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:58,915
at that first billboard
over there?

77
00:07:58,917 --> 00:08:00,852
And then we can have
ourself a conversation

78
00:08:00,854 --> 00:08:03,521
about the motherfucking
environment.

79
00:08:03,523 --> 00:08:05,359
How about that?

80
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,576
Fuck me.

81
00:08:28,414 --> 00:08:30,150
Don't, William.

82
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:36,120
Dixon, you goddamn asshole.

83
00:08:36,122 --> 00:08:39,159
I'm in the middle
of my goddamn Easter dinner.

84
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:41,092
Sorry, kids.

85
00:08:41,094 --> 00:08:42,492
I know, Chief,

86
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:45,063
and I'm sorry for calling
you at home and all, but...

87
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:47,734
I think we got kind of a problem.

88
00:10:08,215 --> 00:10:09,749
No, no. Go back.

89
00:10:34,374 --> 00:10:36,442
Sorry I'm late, Denise.

90
00:10:37,474 --> 00:10:38,910
Did you put up
those billboards yet?

91
00:10:38,912 --> 00:10:39,944
They're up.

92
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:44,247
Go, girl. You go
fuck those cops up.

93
00:10:44,249 --> 00:10:46,918
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, Welby?

94
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,654
You didn't think there would
be legal ramifications?

95
00:10:49,656 --> 00:10:51,322
What's the legal
ramifications, Cedric?

96
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:53,492
Do you want
me to explain?

97
00:10:53,494 --> 00:10:55,794
Little punk like you.
And don't call me Cedric!

98
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:59,663
Ain't contravening no laws
on any fucking thing.

99
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:00,531
I checked.

100
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,565
And where did you check
all this out?

101
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:03,834
In a...

102
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:04,969
A book.

103
00:11:04,971 --> 00:11:06,304
Which book, genius?

104
00:11:06,306 --> 00:11:08,876
Book called <i>Suck My Ass,
It's None Of Your Business.</i>

105
00:11:12,812 --> 00:11:15,313
Fuck.

106
00:11:15,315 --> 00:11:18,116
How long has this person,
or persons,

107
00:11:18,118 --> 00:11:20,117
rented these
billboards out for?

108
00:11:20,119 --> 00:11:22,655
Oh, the year.

109
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:25,792
How long has she
actually paid for?

110
00:11:26,725 --> 00:11:28,125
The year.

111
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,397
So it's a "she", is it?

112
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:33,899
I ain't at liberty
to divulge

113
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,702
that kind of information,
Chief.

114
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,174
Mildred Hayes, perhaps?

115
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:42,140
Ain't at liberty
to divulge

116
00:11:42,142 --> 00:11:43,841
that kind of information,
Chief.

117
00:11:43,843 --> 00:11:44,742
Do you really wanna fuck

118
00:11:44,744 --> 00:11:46,977
with the Ebbing
Police Department, Red?

119
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:48,282
Do you?

120
00:11:49,749 --> 00:11:51,181
I guess.

121
00:11:51,183 --> 00:11:53,284
He said what?
To your face?

122
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:54,685
No crime has been
committed here.

123
00:11:54,687 --> 00:11:57,021
Defamation of character
ain't a crime?

124
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:59,857
Not if she's simply
asking a question.

125
00:11:59,859 --> 00:12:00,891
What are you, an idiot?

126
00:12:00,893 --> 00:12:02,425
Don't call me
an idiot, Dixon!

127
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:03,661
I didn't
call you an idiot,

128
00:12:03,663 --> 00:12:05,463
I asked if you was an idiot.
That was a question.

129
00:12:05,465 --> 00:12:06,865
He got you there, Cedric.

130
00:12:06,867 --> 00:12:08,232
That's it.

131
00:12:08,234 --> 00:12:10,035
Don't fly off the handle.

132
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:11,435
Why in the hell
you keep that man on?

133
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:12,636
He's a good man at heart.

134
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:14,804
He tortured a guy
in custody, Bill.

135
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:18,378
There was no real evidence
to support that.

136
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,713
Take them down.

137
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:23,848
Take that shit down.

138
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,915
What shit?

139
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,919
Hey, boy. Think I wouldn't
take you out right here

140
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:28,920
on Main Street, Red?

141
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,856
Thought you only took out
black dudes, Dixon.

142
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:34,190
No! No! Stop it.

143
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:36,929
You ever fucking touch me,
motherfucker...

144
00:12:38,598 --> 00:12:39,764
You drunk?

145
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:41,935
- Are you drunk right now?
- Get up.

146
00:12:44,604 --> 00:12:47,304
Nobody ever goes
down that road anyways.

147
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:51,107
Unless they got lost.
Or they're retards.

148
00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:52,843
Don't be nervous,
is the main thing.

149
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:54,478
It will go just fine.

150
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,146
Don't look into the
camera, obviously.

151
00:12:56,148 --> 00:12:57,618
Let's hold
for this car.

152
00:12:59,952 --> 00:13:02,185
In three, two, one.

153
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:04,822
So, Mildred Hayes, why did
you put up these billboards?

154
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:06,623
<i>My daughter, Angela,</i>

155
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,425
<i>was abducted,
raped and murdered</i>

156
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:09,526
<i>seven months ago</i>

157
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:11,228
<i>along this selfsame
stretch of road.</i>

158
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,497
What you watching,
Momma? Stupid news?

159
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:15,400
<i>Seems to me
the local police department</i>

160
00:13:15,402 --> 00:13:17,568
<i>is too busy
torturing black folks</i>

161
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,039
<i>to be bothered doing anything
about solving actual crime.</i>

162
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,240
<i>I thought these billboards</i>

163
00:13:22,242 --> 00:13:24,775
<i>might concentrate
their minds some.</i>

164
00:13:24,777 --> 00:13:26,376
Fuck.

165
00:13:26,378 --> 00:13:28,378
<i>I don't know
what the police are doing.</i>

166
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,713
<i>I do know that my...</i>

167
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:33,383
...daughter's burnt body
is lying six feet underground.

168
00:13:33,385 --> 00:13:35,251
They're eating
Krispy Kremes

169
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:36,386
<i>and busting eight-year-olds</i>

170
00:13:36,388 --> 00:13:38,289
<i>for skating
around parking lots.</i>

171
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,924
<i>And Chief Willoughby,</i>

172
00:13:39,926 --> 00:13:41,157
<i>why single him out?</i>

173
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,525
<i>He's the head of them.</i>

174
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,228
<i>Buck's gotta stop somewhere.</i>

175
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,429
<i>And the buck
stops at Willoughby?</i>

176
00:13:45,431 --> 00:13:47,799
<i>Yeah.
Dead right it does.</i>

177
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:05,018
You all right
there, fella?

178
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,056
Looks like we got a war
on our hands.

179
00:14:33,812 --> 00:14:34,914
Can we talk?

180
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,987
I'd do anything
to catch the guy

181
00:14:42,989 --> 00:14:44,122
who did it,
Mrs. Hayes.

182
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,622
But when the DNA
don't match

183
00:14:45,624 --> 00:14:47,558
no one who's ever
been arrested,

184
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:51,362
and when the DNA don't match
any other crime nationwide,

185
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:53,863
and when there wasn't
a single eyewitness

186
00:14:53,865 --> 00:14:55,532
from the time
she'd left your house

187
00:14:55,534 --> 00:14:57,002
to the time we found her,

188
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:01,104
right now there ain't
too much more we can do.

189
00:15:01,106 --> 00:15:04,342
Could pull blood from every
man and boy in this town

190
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:07,144
over the age of eight.

191
00:15:07,146 --> 00:15:10,548
There's civil rights laws
prevents that, Mrs. Hayes.

192
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,516
What if he was just
passing through town?

193
00:15:12,518 --> 00:15:14,352
Every man
in the country, then.

194
00:15:14,354 --> 00:15:16,621
What if he was just passing
through the country?

195
00:15:16,623 --> 00:15:19,589
If it was me,
I'd start up a database.

196
00:15:19,591 --> 00:15:22,359
Every male baby what's
born, stick them on it,

197
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:24,562
and as soon as he done
something wrong,

198
00:15:24,564 --> 00:15:25,728
cross-reference it,

199
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:28,500
make 100% certain
it was a correct match,

200
00:15:28,502 --> 00:15:29,835
then kill him.

201
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:35,473
Yeah, well, there's
definitely civil rights laws

202
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:36,777
prevents that.

203
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:44,082
I'm doing everything I can
to track him down.

204
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:47,450
I don't think those
billboards is very fair.

205
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:49,453
The time it took you
to get out here

206
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:50,687
whining like a bitch,
Willoughby,

207
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:52,088
some other poor girl's
probably

208
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,089
being butchered
right now.

209
00:15:53,091 --> 00:15:54,458
But I'm glad you got
your priorities straight,

210
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,961
I'll say that for you.

211
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:06,672
There's something else,
Mildred.

212
00:16:11,277 --> 00:16:12,646
I got cancer.

213
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,413
I'm dying.

214
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:16,716
I know it.

215
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:20,550
Huh?

216
00:16:20,552 --> 00:16:23,123
I know it. Most everybody
in town knows it.

217
00:16:28,427 --> 00:16:30,627
And you still put up
those billboards?

218
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:32,163
Well, they wouldn't be
as effective

219
00:16:32,165 --> 00:16:34,167
after you croak.
Right?

220
00:17:15,407 --> 00:17:17,307
Well, looky looky.

221
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,576
If it ain't
the instigator

222
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:20,778
of this whole goddamn affair
in the first place.

223
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,913
I didn't
instigate shit, Dixon.

224
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:25,415
Playing pool
against the town midget.

225
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:26,584
He's right, Red,

226
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,618
you are playing pool
against the town midget.

227
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,754
He's a cop,
he's observant.

228
00:17:30,756 --> 00:17:32,790
I always disliked you,

229
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:35,091
ever since you was
a snotty little child.

230
00:17:35,093 --> 00:17:37,895
You still look like
a snotty little child.

231
00:17:37,897 --> 00:17:40,731
That's unfortunate. I always
thought you was great.

232
00:17:40,733 --> 00:17:46,236
Even your name, Red Welby.
Even your name I disliked.

233
00:17:46,238 --> 00:17:48,772
Well, okay.

234
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:52,676
Like you was some kind of
goddamn communist

235
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:53,845
and proud of it.

236
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:57,815
No, it's because
I got red hair.

237
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,215
You know what they do
to faggots

238
00:17:59,217 --> 00:18:00,553
down in Cuba, Welby?

239
00:18:01,186 --> 00:18:02,353
Wow, that's left field.

240
00:18:02,355 --> 00:18:05,325
No, what do they do to
faggots down in Cuba, Dixon?

241
00:18:06,091 --> 00:18:07,290
They kill them.

242
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:11,296
Which, it might surprise you
to learn, I'm against.

243
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,696
I'm not sure if they do
kill faggots

244
00:18:12,698 --> 00:18:13,998
down in Cuba, Dixon.

245
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,299
I know Cuba's human rights
record's pretty deplorable

246
00:18:16,301 --> 00:18:18,569
when it comes to
homosexuality,

247
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:20,870
but killing them?

248
00:18:20,872 --> 00:18:23,707
Are you sure you ain't
thinking of Wyoming?

249
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:26,876
Always gotta be
the smart-ass, Jesus.

250
00:18:26,878 --> 00:18:28,581
He's quite good,
isn't he?

251
00:18:32,752 --> 00:18:36,119
Hey, Willoughby's a good man.
Hey, look at me. Look at me.

252
00:18:36,121 --> 00:18:38,289
I'm talking nice
to you now, aren't I?

253
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,792
I'm talking nice to you.

254
00:18:40,459 --> 00:18:41,992
He's a good man.

255
00:18:41,994 --> 00:18:44,661
Shouldn't have this be the
only thing he thinks about,

256
00:18:44,663 --> 00:18:46,299
last months left to him.

257
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,202
Last months what?

258
00:18:53,505 --> 00:18:55,172
Oh...

259
00:18:55,174 --> 00:18:57,241
You didn't know?

260
00:18:57,243 --> 00:18:59,076
Yeah, pancreatic.

261
00:18:59,078 --> 00:19:02,546
I'm up next. You old
ladies quit yakking.

262
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:03,646
Rude.

263
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:04,882
Hey, Mildred.

264
00:19:04,884 --> 00:19:07,518
I saw you on TV
the other day.

265
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,953
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you looked good.

266
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:13,156
I mean, you know,
you came across really good

267
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:15,059
in the things
that you were saying.

268
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:17,226
I didn't think you
came across real good.

269
00:19:17,228 --> 00:19:20,764
I thought you came across
as a stupid-ass.

270
00:19:20,766 --> 00:19:21,866
Ain't it about time
you got home

271
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:23,701
to your momma, Dixon?

272
00:19:23,703 --> 00:19:26,904
No, it ain't time
I go home to my momma.

273
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:31,075
I told her I was gonna be out
till 12:00, actually.

274
00:19:31,077 --> 00:19:32,145
Jesus.

275
00:19:37,684 --> 00:19:41,551
That's me versus you,
Mildred. Uh-huh.

276
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:43,553
Hey, Robbie.
I think that midget

277
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:45,722
wants to get in my pants.

278
00:19:45,724 --> 00:19:48,026
Father Montgomery.

279
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:52,163
Mildred. I'm sorry to be
calling on you so late,

280
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:53,396
but, uh...

281
00:19:53,398 --> 00:19:57,401
I must say, Robbie has
been the consummate host.

282
00:19:57,403 --> 00:20:01,172
Despite his having had,
as he was just telling me

283
00:20:01,174 --> 00:20:03,206
somewhat of a tricky day
at school.

284
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:06,242
Just some of the guys
on the team giving me crap.

285
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:07,543
Crap about what?

286
00:20:07,545 --> 00:20:10,180
About the billboards,
Mildred.

287
00:20:10,182 --> 00:20:12,649
Which is what I've come to
have a word with you about.

288
00:20:12,651 --> 00:20:15,019
Oh. Proceed.

289
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:17,887
I know how hard it's
been for you, Mildred,

290
00:20:17,889 --> 00:20:19,790
this past year.
We all do.

291
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:22,960
And if there is ever
anything that you need,

292
00:20:22,962 --> 00:20:24,594
we will be there for you.

293
00:20:24,596 --> 00:20:25,932
Always.

294
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:28,232
But the town also knows

295
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:31,271
what kind of a man
William Willoughby is.

296
00:20:32,338 --> 00:20:33,703
And the town is dead set

297
00:20:33,705 --> 00:20:36,706
against these billboards
of yours.

298
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:37,942
Took a poll,
did you, Father?

299
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:41,212
If you hadn't stopped
coming to church,

300
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:44,482
you'd have a little bit
more understanding

301
00:20:44,484 --> 00:20:46,416
of the depth
of people's feelings.

302
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:50,320
More than a dozen people
came to me on Sunday.

303
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:52,425
So, yes, I took a poll.

304
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:57,163
Everybody is with you
about Angela.

305
00:20:57,963 --> 00:21:00,166
Nobody is with you
about this.

306
00:21:05,838 --> 00:21:08,705
You know what I was
thinking about today?

307
00:21:08,707 --> 00:21:10,441
I was thinking
about those street gangs

308
00:21:10,443 --> 00:21:11,841
they have
down in Los Angeles,

309
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:14,778
those Crips
and those Bloods.

310
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:16,480
And I was thinking about
that bunch of new laws

311
00:21:16,482 --> 00:21:17,647
they came up with

312
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,617
in the 1980s,
I think it was,

313
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:24,088
to combat those street gangs,
those Crips and those Bloods.

314
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:25,388
And, if I remember rightly,

315
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,526
the gist of what those
new laws were saying was,

316
00:21:28,528 --> 00:21:30,161
if you join
one of these gangs,

317
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,863
and you're running
with them,

318
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:35,232
and down the block one night,
unbeknownst to you,

319
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:37,768
one of your fellow Crips,
or your fellow Bloods,

320
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,570
shoot up a place,
or stab a guy...

321
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:42,639
Well then, even though

322
00:21:42,641 --> 00:21:44,241
you may not know
nothing about it

323
00:21:44,243 --> 00:21:47,845
and you were just standing
on a street corner

324
00:21:47,847 --> 00:21:49,847
minding your own business,

325
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:54,452
what these new laws said
was you're still culpable.

326
00:21:54,454 --> 00:21:56,819
You're still culpable
by the very act of having

327
00:21:56,821 --> 00:21:58,255
joined those Crips
and those Bloods

328
00:21:58,257 --> 00:22:00,257
in the first place.

329
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:02,592
Which got me thinking,
Father,

330
00:22:02,594 --> 00:22:04,127
that whole
type of situation

331
00:22:04,129 --> 00:22:07,464
is kinda like you
church boys, ain't it?

332
00:22:07,466 --> 00:22:10,934
You got your colors,
you got your clubhouse.

333
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:14,437
You're, for want
of a better word, a gang.

334
00:22:14,439 --> 00:22:15,905
And if you were upstairs

335
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:17,907
smoking a pipe
and reading your Bible

336
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:19,809
while one of your fellow
gang members

337
00:22:19,811 --> 00:22:22,713
is downstairs fucking
an altar boy, well...

338
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:26,216
Father, just like those Crips,
and just like those Bloods,

339
00:22:26,218 --> 00:22:27,684
you're culpable.

340
00:22:27,686 --> 00:22:30,753
Because you joined
the gang, man.

341
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:32,321
I don't care
if you never did shit,

342
00:22:32,323 --> 00:22:34,992
you never saw shit,
you never heard shit,

343
00:22:34,994 --> 00:22:39,195
you join the gang,
you're culpable.

344
00:22:39,197 --> 00:22:42,399
And when a person is culpable
to altar-boy-fucking,

345
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:43,567
or any kinda boy-fucking,

346
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:47,570
because I know you guys didn't
really narrow that down,

347
00:22:47,572 --> 00:22:50,007
then you kinda forfeit the
right to come into my house

348
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:51,876
and say anything about me

349
00:22:51,878 --> 00:22:55,281
or my life, or my daughter,
or my billboards.

350
00:22:58,517 --> 00:23:01,184
So why don't you just finish
up your tea there, Father,

351
00:23:01,186 --> 00:23:03,255
and get the fuck
outta my kitchen.

352
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:16,268
But thanks for coming up
anyway, Father.

353
00:23:21,072 --> 00:23:22,472
How you been
feeling, Bill?

354
00:23:24,009 --> 00:23:28,011
Ah, like I got cancer
in a major organ.

355
00:23:28,013 --> 00:23:31,147
Well, I just want you to know
we're all on your side

356
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:33,250
about this
Mildred Hayes thing.

357
00:23:33,252 --> 00:23:37,190
If I have to hear that
one more fucking time...

358
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:43,196
I'm done with this shit.
I can't waste my life waiting.

359
00:23:45,732 --> 00:23:47,364
Stop reading
fucking comic books

360
00:23:47,366 --> 00:23:49,899
and get me the file
on the Hayes case.

361
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:52,735
Angela Hayes case
or the Mildred Hayes case?

362
00:23:52,737 --> 00:23:54,871
There is no
Mildred Hayes case.

363
00:23:54,873 --> 00:23:56,405
We've had
two official complaints

364
00:23:56,407 --> 00:23:58,341
about those billboards,
so, actually...

365
00:23:58,343 --> 00:23:59,344
From who?

366
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:05,585
There's a lady
with a funny eye

367
00:24:06,351 --> 00:24:08,086
and a fat dentist.

368
00:24:09,087 --> 00:24:13,156
Get me the file
on the Angela Hayes case.

369
00:24:13,158 --> 00:24:16,726
"Lady with
a funny fucking eye"?

370
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:18,130
Jesus Christ.

371
00:24:31,609 --> 00:24:32,678
Late night?

372
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:37,146
No.

373
00:24:37,148 --> 00:24:39,185
Lay off that Welby guy,
will you?

374
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:42,351
Or you'll do what?

375
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:44,620
Kick your momma's
fucking teeth in.

376
00:24:44,622 --> 00:24:45,991
No, you won't.

377
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:51,127
Who told you I was laying on him anyway?
The midget?

378
00:24:51,129 --> 00:24:53,931
What the fuck
are you talking about?

379
00:24:53,933 --> 00:24:55,898
And I'm trying
to fucking concentrate.

380
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,269
Fucking midgets!

381
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:23,663
What you looking for
anyway?

382
00:25:26,165 --> 00:25:28,234
There's nothing
to look for.

383
00:25:30,836 --> 00:25:33,503
I don't know what it is.

384
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:35,571
It feels like
it's kinda waggling.

385
00:25:35,573 --> 00:25:38,677
Well, if it's waggling,
it's gonna have to come out.

386
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,016
Ain't you gonna
take a look at it first?

387
00:25:45,684 --> 00:25:47,286
It's gonna have to come out.

388
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,494
Can I get a little
Novocaine there, doc?

389
00:26:10,909 --> 00:26:12,445
Give it a couple
of minutes.

390
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:30,161
There's a lot
of good friends

391
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:31,861
of Bill Willoughby
in this town.

392
00:26:31,863 --> 00:26:33,931
No! Ow! Stop! No!

393
00:26:36,534 --> 00:26:38,271
God damn it!

394
00:26:44,743 --> 00:26:46,710
Then why don't you tell
those good friends

395
00:26:46,712 --> 00:26:47,778
of Bill Willoughby

396
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,583
to tell him to go do his
fucking job, fat boy.

397
00:27:05,097 --> 00:27:07,097
Hey, Mildred.

398
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,799
You didn't happen
to pay a visit

399
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:10,166
to the dentist today,
did you?

400
00:27:10,168 --> 00:27:11,902
- No.
- Huh?

401
00:27:11,904 --> 00:27:13,302
I said "no".

402
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:16,705
So it wasn't you
who drilled a little hole

403
00:27:16,707 --> 00:27:21,077
in one of big fat Geoffrey's
big fat thumbnails, no?

404
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:23,046
- Of course not.
- Huh?

405
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:24,947
I said "of course not".

406
00:27:24,949 --> 00:27:27,084
You drilled a hole
in the dentist?

407
00:27:27,086 --> 00:27:28,385
Denise, no, I didn't.

408
00:27:28,387 --> 00:27:30,319
I thought it was
kinda funny myself,

409
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:32,856
but he wants
to press charges,

410
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:35,861
so we're gonna have to
bring you in, I'm afraid.

411
00:27:57,116 --> 00:27:58,248
So how's it all going

412
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:00,416
in the nigger-torturing
business, Dixon?

413
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:04,186
It's persons-of-color-torturing
business, these days.

414
00:28:04,188 --> 00:28:07,560
If you wanna know,
I didn't torture nobody.

415
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:10,394
What's the matter
with you,

416
00:28:10,396 --> 00:28:13,195
saying that
goddamn stuff on TV?

417
00:28:13,197 --> 00:28:15,130
My momma watches
that station.

418
00:28:15,132 --> 00:28:16,665
She doesn't know
about the torturing?

419
00:28:16,667 --> 00:28:19,336
No. She's against
that kinda thing.

420
00:28:19,338 --> 00:28:20,537
Who's against what?

421
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:23,339
My momma is against
persons-of-color-torturing.

422
00:28:23,341 --> 00:28:24,808
She said
"nigger-torturing".

423
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,842
I said, "You can't say
'nigger-torturing' no more.

424
00:28:26,844 --> 00:28:29,412
"You gotta say
persons-of-color-torturing."

425
00:28:29,414 --> 00:28:30,750
Isn't that right, Chief?

426
00:28:31,282 --> 00:28:32,651
Ain't that right?

427
00:28:35,353 --> 00:28:39,188
I think I'll be able to
take care of Mrs. Hayes

428
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:41,626
on my own
from here on, Jason.

429
00:28:46,698 --> 00:28:48,833
Sure, Chief.
I'll be right outside.

430
00:29:00,846 --> 00:29:02,846
Don't give me that look.

431
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:06,849
If you got rid of every cop
with vaguely racist leanings,

432
00:29:06,851 --> 00:29:08,918
you'd have three cops left,

433
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,320
and all of them are gonna
hate the fags.

434
00:29:11,322 --> 00:29:13,790
So what are you gonna do,
you know?

435
00:29:15,994 --> 00:29:18,094
I wanna know something,
Mildred.

436
00:29:18,096 --> 00:29:19,663
Why did you drill a hole

437
00:29:19,665 --> 00:29:22,732
through poor fat
Geoffrey's thumbnail?

438
00:29:22,734 --> 00:29:24,733
That did not happen.

439
00:29:24,735 --> 00:29:26,203
His hand slipped.

440
00:29:26,205 --> 00:29:28,806
He drilled a hole
through his own self.

441
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,206
Did he say I did it?

442
00:29:30,208 --> 00:29:32,008
I guess it's his word

443
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:34,011
against mine, then, huh?

444
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:36,812
Kinda like in all those
rape cases you hear about.

445
00:29:36,814 --> 00:29:39,782
Except, this time,
the chick ain't losing.

446
00:29:39,784 --> 00:29:42,019
It ain't really about winning
or losing, though,

447
00:29:42,021 --> 00:29:44,154
is it, Mildred?

448
00:29:44,156 --> 00:29:47,257
You think I care about
who wins or loses

449
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:48,992
between the two of youse?

450
00:29:48,994 --> 00:29:51,261
You think
I care about dentists?

451
00:29:51,263 --> 00:29:53,230
I don't care about
dentists.

452
00:29:53,232 --> 00:29:55,434
Nobody cares
about dentists.

453
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:59,472
What I do care about,
or what I'm

454
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:02,673
interested in

455
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,776
is tying you up
in court so long

456
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:08,043
that your hours
at the gift shop

457
00:30:08,045 --> 00:30:10,380
be so shot to shit

458
00:30:10,382 --> 00:30:12,281
that you ain't gonna
have a penny

459
00:30:12,283 --> 00:30:14,820
to pay for another
month's billboards.

460
00:30:15,654 --> 00:30:18,186
That's what
I'm interested in.

461
00:30:18,188 --> 00:30:19,822
I got some dough
put away.

462
00:30:19,824 --> 00:30:22,125
But what I heard was
you had to sell off

463
00:30:22,127 --> 00:30:23,559
your ex-husband's
tractor-trailer

464
00:30:23,561 --> 00:30:27,032
to even pay for this month's
billboards, that right?

465
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:30,733
How is old Charlie,
by the way?

466
00:30:30,735 --> 00:30:34,069
He still shacked up with
that pretty little intern

467
00:30:34,071 --> 00:30:35,271
works down at the zoo?

468
00:30:35,273 --> 00:30:38,008
Still shacked up with some
chick smells of shit.

469
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,176
I don't know if the zoo's
got anything to do with it.

470
00:30:40,178 --> 00:30:42,044
Although I'd hope so.

471
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:47,216
How old is she?
Nineteen?

472
00:30:47,218 --> 00:30:49,452
That must smart.

473
00:30:49,454 --> 00:30:52,821
Keep trying.
Keep trying.

474
00:30:52,823 --> 00:30:56,026
What's Charlie think about
these billboards of yours,

475
00:30:56,028 --> 00:30:57,894
an ex-cop like Charlie?

476
00:30:57,896 --> 00:30:59,163
Ex-cop, ex-wife-beater.

477
00:30:59,165 --> 00:31:00,463
Same difference,
I guess, right?

478
00:31:00,465 --> 00:31:03,436
His word against yours,
though, right?

479
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,570
Charlie don't know
about them, does he?

480
00:31:07,572 --> 00:31:09,172
It's none of his business.

481
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:10,907
He's kinda paying
for them, though.

482
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:12,242
I'm paying for them!

483
00:31:12,244 --> 00:31:13,376
This month you are.

484
00:31:13,378 --> 00:31:15,648
How about when...

485
00:31:20,918 --> 00:31:22,050
I didn't mean to...

486
00:31:22,052 --> 00:31:23,185
I know.

487
00:31:23,187 --> 00:31:24,319
It was an accident.

488
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:25,590
I know, baby.

489
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:27,659
It's blood.

490
00:31:30,227 --> 00:31:33,062
I'm gonna go
get somebody.

491
00:31:33,064 --> 00:31:34,966
Hey!

492
00:31:36,068 --> 00:31:37,267
Just let her go.

493
00:31:37,269 --> 00:31:38,501
Come on, Chief.

494
00:31:38,503 --> 00:31:40,539
Just let her go!

495
00:31:44,542 --> 00:31:46,411
Easy, easy, easy.

496
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:51,583
Hey...

497
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:14,404
Do birds get cancer?

498
00:32:14,406 --> 00:32:15,973
Huh?

499
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,074
Birds. Do they get cancer?

500
00:32:18,076 --> 00:32:20,443
I don't know. Dogs do.

501
00:32:20,445 --> 00:32:23,581
Yeah, well, I wasn't talking
about dogs, was I?

502
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:33,290
Great, the good old "Raped
While Dying" ride home.

503
00:32:33,292 --> 00:32:34,957
If there was two seconds
in a day

504
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:38,094
when I wasn't thinking
about how she died...

505
00:32:38,096 --> 00:32:41,164
"Think about it some more,
why don't you?"

506
00:32:41,166 --> 00:32:43,465
As much as
a person might have

507
00:32:43,467 --> 00:32:46,403
tried to avoid the details
of what happened

508
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:48,271
because he didn't think
it would do any good,

509
00:32:48,273 --> 00:32:50,240
and he couldn't
bear it,

510
00:32:50,242 --> 00:32:53,976
it's also good to be informed
in 20-foot-high font

511
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:57,813
the precise details
of her last moments.

512
00:32:57,815 --> 00:33:00,684
That it wasn't enough
that she was raped

513
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:03,552
and it wasn't enough
that she died, no.

514
00:33:03,554 --> 00:33:06,455
"Raped While Dying."

515
00:33:06,457 --> 00:33:07,892
Thank you, Mom.

516
00:33:09,561 --> 00:33:11,895
I gave you
the police reports.

517
00:33:11,897 --> 00:33:13,963
I didn't read them.

518
00:33:13,965 --> 00:33:17,235
I'm depressed enough
as it fucking is.

519
00:33:57,509 --> 00:33:59,209
<i>Mom?</i>

520
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:00,376
<i>Yeah?</i>

521
00:34:00,378 --> 00:34:02,478
<i>You ain't going out
again tonight, are you?</i>

522
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,681
Denise and I are gonna
grab a couple of beers.

523
00:34:04,683 --> 00:34:05,982
Denise gonna be
driving you?

524
00:34:05,984 --> 00:34:08,650
Why don't you just
ask to borrow the car?

525
00:34:08,652 --> 00:34:11,054
- Can I borrow the car?
- No.

526
00:34:11,056 --> 00:34:12,021
Bitch!

527
00:34:12,023 --> 00:34:13,790
I will give you money
for a taxi

528
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,657
if you ask nice
and don't call me a bitch.

529
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,960
Why make me ask if you
weren't gonna let me?

530
00:34:17,962 --> 00:34:18,929
It was funny.

531
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,529
And because you've been
smoking pot all day.

532
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:22,632
- You are such a hypocrite.
- Hypocrite?

533
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:24,366
- Yeah.
- How?

534
00:34:24,368 --> 00:34:26,402
Drove drunk
when we were kids.

535
00:34:26,404 --> 00:34:28,003
What are you
talking about?

536
00:34:28,005 --> 00:34:29,371
Daddy told me.

537
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:30,639
When did you see him?

538
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:32,041
Don't change the subject.

539
00:34:32,043 --> 00:34:35,378
Did you drive drunk with us
in the car when we were kids?

540
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,579
Once, maybe.

541
00:34:36,581 --> 00:34:37,947
Okay, once?

542
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:39,514
When he was in the middle
of beating the shit out of me.

543
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:41,183
Which we've only
got your word about!

544
00:34:41,185 --> 00:34:42,719
Angela, for Christ sakes.

545
00:34:42,721 --> 00:34:44,721
Why are you
never on my side?

546
00:34:44,723 --> 00:34:46,456
I'm always on your side when
you're not being a cunt!

547
00:34:46,458 --> 00:34:47,623
Hey!

548
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:49,458
There will be no more
"cunts" in this house.

549
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,728
Are you moving out?

550
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:52,998
It was a gag.

551
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:56,933
Are you gonna let me
borrow the car or what?

552
00:34:56,935 --> 00:34:59,668
Why don't you
just walk, Angela?

553
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:02,672
You know what?
I will walk.

554
00:35:02,674 --> 00:35:06,675
And you know what else?
I hope I get raped on the way!

555
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:08,947
I hope you do too!

556
00:35:23,594 --> 00:35:25,962
<i>Gonna need to keep you
in a few days, Bill.</i>

557
00:35:25,964 --> 00:35:28,331
<i>You shouldn't be
coughing up blood.</i>

558
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:31,701
Yeah, I kinda
guessed that, Doc.

559
00:35:31,703 --> 00:35:33,902
I'll swing by
in the morning.

560
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:34,973
Anne.

561
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:42,378
I guess I'll go
get your coat, huh?

562
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,313
Well, you know
I ain't staying.

563
00:35:44,315 --> 00:35:45,916
You know
I ain't arguing.

564
00:36:39,003 --> 00:36:40,105
Oops.

565
00:36:46,712 --> 00:36:48,112
You old cunt.

566
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:50,746
I'm not old, Robbie.

567
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,317
That's Dad.

568
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,454
Hey, Dad.
How's it going?

569
00:36:58,456 --> 00:36:59,825
Where's the crazy lady?

570
00:37:06,864 --> 00:37:09,398
Kid has got Rice fucking
Krispies in his fucking hair.

571
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,366
What's going on?

572
00:37:10,368 --> 00:37:12,835
What's going on with these
fucking billboards?

573
00:37:12,837 --> 00:37:14,538
Kinda self-explanatory.

574
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,206
Why don't you
explain it to me?

575
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:20,675
Guess it ain't
self-explanatory, then.

576
00:37:20,677 --> 00:37:23,579
I wanted certain
people's minds

577
00:37:23,581 --> 00:37:25,815
kept on certain
people's jobs, is all.

578
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:28,083
Hadn't heard from them
in seven goddamn months.

579
00:37:28,085 --> 00:37:30,686
I've heard an awful lot
from them

580
00:37:30,688 --> 00:37:32,154
since I put them
billboards up.

581
00:37:32,156 --> 00:37:34,657
You think this has
focused their minds? Mmm?

582
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:38,126
It's focused their minds
on how exactly

583
00:37:38,128 --> 00:37:39,395
are they gonna
fuck you up.

584
00:37:39,397 --> 00:37:41,396
The more you keep a case
in the public eye,

585
00:37:41,398 --> 00:37:44,032
the better your chances
are of getting it solved.

586
00:37:44,034 --> 00:37:45,967
It's in
all the guidebooks.

587
00:37:45,969 --> 00:37:47,969
How much
these billboards cost?

588
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:49,572
About the same
as a tractor-trailer.

589
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,041
What the fuck
are you laughing at?

590
00:37:52,043 --> 00:37:52,909
Nothing.

591
00:37:52,911 --> 00:37:54,009
Laughed at by a guy

592
00:37:54,011 --> 00:37:55,712
with fucking cereal
in his hair.

593
00:37:55,714 --> 00:37:57,313
How's Penelope?

594
00:37:57,315 --> 00:37:58,715
Huh? She's all right.

595
00:37:58,717 --> 00:38:00,148
Why don't you
invite her in?

596
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,784
Save leaving her
sitting out there.

597
00:38:01,786 --> 00:38:03,920
- She here?
- She's out in the car.

598
00:38:03,922 --> 00:38:05,456
That explains it.

599
00:38:06,757 --> 00:38:07,989
That explains what?

600
00:38:07,991 --> 00:38:09,327
I know
I smelt something.

601
00:38:12,362 --> 00:38:13,630
Let her go!

602
00:38:13,632 --> 00:38:16,733
Oh! Um, I kinda need
to use the bathroom,

603
00:38:16,735 --> 00:38:17,900
but if it's inconvenient...

604
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:20,136
Actually, it is
inconvenient, isn't it?

605
00:38:20,138 --> 00:38:21,471
I can hold it.
It's all right.

606
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:22,871
It's the first door
down the hall.

607
00:38:22,873 --> 00:38:25,340
Sure? I feel like
I'm intruding.

608
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:26,643
Just go pee.

609
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:27,880
Oh.

610
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:47,963
Look, you said
what you came to say.

611
00:38:47,965 --> 00:38:49,498
So why don't you go
get zoo girl

612
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
and get the hell out of
my house, all right?

613
00:38:51,502 --> 00:38:54,637
Um, actually, zoo-wise,
they were letting people go

614
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,804
at the zoo,
unfortunately,

615
00:38:55,806 --> 00:38:58,174
and it was a case of
"last in, first out". So...

616
00:38:58,176 --> 00:39:00,777
Unfortunately the zoo
had to let me go.

617
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:01,911
But they were looking
for people

618
00:39:01,913 --> 00:39:05,047
down at the horse rides
for the disableds.

619
00:39:05,049 --> 00:39:06,849
So I'm working
down there now,

620
00:39:06,851 --> 00:39:09,221
looking after
the disableds' horses.

621
00:39:17,761 --> 00:39:19,395
Don't say a word.

622
00:39:19,397 --> 00:39:21,132
I wasn't gonna say a word.

623
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:27,038
You don't think I don't wish
it had never happened?

624
00:39:30,375 --> 00:39:32,842
You don't think I don't wish
she was still here?

625
00:39:32,844 --> 00:39:34,880
I know you do.

626
00:39:36,281 --> 00:39:38,016
I know you do.

627
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:43,386
Billboards ain't gonna
bring her back, Mildred.

628
00:39:43,388 --> 00:39:46,558
Neither is fucking
19-year-olds, Charlie.

629
00:39:48,326 --> 00:39:49,427
Yeah?

630
00:39:50,295 --> 00:39:52,063
But I know that.

631
00:39:53,764 --> 00:39:55,434
Just go.

632
00:39:56,567 --> 00:39:58,302
Yeah, all right.

633
00:39:59,036 --> 00:40:00,369
I'm such a shitty dad

634
00:40:00,371 --> 00:40:02,273
and you're such a great mom.
All right.

635
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:06,442
So how come a week
before she died

636
00:40:06,444 --> 00:40:09,579
she's asking if she can move
in with me at my place?

637
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:11,114
Couldn't stand you bitching

638
00:40:11,116 --> 00:40:12,982
and fighting
with each other no more.

639
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:14,016
I don't believe you.

640
00:40:14,018 --> 00:40:18,121
I said, "Stay,
your mom loves you."

641
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:22,257
Now I wish I hadn't.
She'd still fucking be here.

642
00:40:22,259 --> 00:40:23,659
I don't believe you!

643
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:25,364
Don't believe me.

644
00:40:25,996 --> 00:40:28,065
Ask Froot Loop boy.

645
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:39,478
Is that true?

646
00:40:41,511 --> 00:40:43,247
I don't know, Mom.

647
00:40:46,351 --> 00:40:48,119
Yeah, you do.

648
00:40:55,025 --> 00:40:56,358
<i>What's the matter?</i>

649
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,626
<i>Nothing.</i>

650
00:40:57,628 --> 00:41:01,063
Oh, come on,
not Donald Sutherland again.

651
00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:03,766
What is this, frickin'
Donald Sutherland season?

652
00:41:03,768 --> 00:41:05,934
I like him.
I like his hair.

653
00:41:05,936 --> 00:41:07,272
Hair?

654
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:10,840
This is the one
where his little girl dies.

655
00:41:10,842 --> 00:41:13,942
Always a plus in a movie.

656
00:41:13,944 --> 00:41:15,911
Talking of dead kids,

657
00:41:15,913 --> 00:41:18,181
what's happening
with the billboard lady?

658
00:41:18,183 --> 00:41:21,250
Oh, that kooz
won't listen to reason.

659
00:41:21,252 --> 00:41:23,251
She's tough as an old boot.

660
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:24,454
Oh...

661
00:41:24,456 --> 00:41:26,054
Why don't you just
fuck her over

662
00:41:26,056 --> 00:41:27,558
through her friends then?

663
00:41:29,259 --> 00:41:30,192
Huh?

664
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:32,795
You know, why don't you
fuck her friends over?

665
00:41:32,797 --> 00:41:35,230
Bring her around
that way.

666
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,169
She got any friends
you can fuck over?

667
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:52,684
Rat bastards.

668
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:03,893
Hey, fuckhead!

669
00:42:03,895 --> 00:42:04,960
What?

670
00:42:04,962 --> 00:42:06,395
Don't say "what", Dixon,

671
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:08,730
when she comes in
calling you a fuckhead.

672
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:10,632
- And don't you...
- Shut up!

673
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:12,835
You, get over here.

674
00:42:12,837 --> 00:42:16,337
No! You, get over here.

675
00:42:16,339 --> 00:42:17,440
All right.

676
00:42:17,442 --> 00:42:19,275
What? Dixon!

677
00:42:19,277 --> 00:42:21,444
You do not allow a member
of the public

678
00:42:21,446 --> 00:42:23,311
to call you a fuckhead
in the station house!

679
00:42:23,313 --> 00:42:25,614
I'm taking care of it
in my own way.

680
00:42:25,616 --> 00:42:27,550
Now get out of my ass.

681
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:30,887
Mrs. Hayes, have a seat.
What can I do for you today?

682
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:32,389
Where's Denise Watson?

683
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:33,922
In the clanger.

684
00:42:33,924 --> 00:42:35,824
- On what charge?
- Possession.

685
00:42:35,826 --> 00:42:36,992
Of what?

686
00:42:36,994 --> 00:42:38,661
Two marijuana cigarettes.

687
00:42:38,663 --> 00:42:39,996
Big ones.

688
00:42:39,998 --> 00:42:41,264
When is the bail hearing?

689
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:43,766
I asked the judge
not to give her bail

690
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:46,636
on account of her previous
marijuana violations,

691
00:42:46,638 --> 00:42:48,070
and the judge said "sure."

692
00:42:48,072 --> 00:42:49,340
You fucking prick!

693
00:42:53,277 --> 00:42:55,945
You do not call an officer
of the law a fucking prick

694
00:42:55,947 --> 00:42:58,280
in his own station house,
Mrs. Hayes.

695
00:42:58,282 --> 00:43:00,051
Or anywhere, actually.

696
00:43:01,286 --> 00:43:03,753
What's with the new
attitude, Dixon?

697
00:43:03,755 --> 00:43:05,757
Your momma
been coaching you?

698
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:08,560
No.

699
00:43:09,393 --> 00:43:10,759
My momma

700
00:43:10,761 --> 00:43:12,096
doesn't do that.

701
00:43:14,799 --> 00:43:17,101
Take them down,
you hear me?

702
00:43:18,668 --> 00:43:20,270
You did good, Dixon.

703
00:43:20,272 --> 00:43:22,273
Yeah, I know I did.

704
00:43:25,643 --> 00:43:27,842
Almost got that.

705
00:43:27,844 --> 00:43:30,311
The rules here are twofold.

706
00:43:30,313 --> 00:43:33,916
No kid can leave
this goddamn blanket

707
00:43:33,918 --> 00:43:36,219
at any goddamn time.

708
00:43:36,221 --> 00:43:38,186
And every single one

709
00:43:38,188 --> 00:43:40,956
of these dolls
and these teddy bears

710
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:43,259
has got to be hooked up.

711
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:45,128
Now, your momma and I,

712
00:43:45,130 --> 00:43:46,561
although it won't
look like it,

713
00:43:46,563 --> 00:43:50,333
we'll be watching
every goddamn move you make.

714
00:43:50,335 --> 00:43:53,503
So the most important thing
while we are watching you

715
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:57,907
is that you do not
leave this blanket.

716
00:43:57,909 --> 00:44:03,244
Next most important thing,
you do not at any stage

717
00:44:03,246 --> 00:44:05,313
allow the fishing rods

718
00:44:05,315 --> 00:44:09,050
to stick into you
or your sister's eyeballs,

719
00:44:09,052 --> 00:44:11,786
as this would be
counter-productive

720
00:44:11,788 --> 00:44:14,223
to the entire operation.

721
00:44:14,225 --> 00:44:15,657
What would it be?

722
00:44:15,659 --> 00:44:20,896
Counter-productive
to the entire operation.

723
00:44:20,898 --> 00:44:22,634
Then, troops,

724
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:27,438
start fishing.

725
00:44:30,475 --> 00:44:32,407
We are not.

726
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:33,878
We are.

727
00:44:35,947 --> 00:44:37,215
Yes.

728
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:19,624
Hey, baby.

729
00:45:24,027 --> 00:45:27,398
Yeah,
still no arrests.

730
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:32,835
How come, I wonder?

731
00:45:32,837 --> 00:45:34,770
Because there ain't no God,
the whole world's empty,

732
00:45:34,772 --> 00:45:37,308
and it doesn't matter
what we do to each other?

733
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:41,646
I hope not.

734
00:45:47,217 --> 00:45:48,617
How come
you came up here

735
00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:50,922
outta nowhere
looking so pretty?

736
00:45:52,522 --> 00:45:53,790
You ain't trying
to make me believe

737
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:56,791
in reincarnation
or something, are you?

738
00:45:56,793 --> 00:45:59,598
Because you're pretty,
but you ain't her.

739
00:46:00,998 --> 00:46:03,032
She got killed,

740
00:46:03,034 --> 00:46:05,237
and now she's dead forever.

741
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,608
I do thank you
for coming though.

742
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:14,076
If I had some food
I'd give it to you.

743
00:46:14,078 --> 00:46:15,545
All I got is some Doritos.

744
00:46:15,547 --> 00:46:18,780
They might kill you,
they're kind of pointy.

745
00:46:18,782 --> 00:46:20,652
Then where would we be?

746
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:40,103
Yeah, so I, uh,
just happened to be looking

747
00:46:40,105 --> 00:46:43,905
over our contract that we
drew up back that time.

748
00:46:43,907 --> 00:46:45,840
What I realized was I...

749
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:49,277
I realized that although
payment is to be made

750
00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:50,779
on the first day
of each month,

751
00:46:50,781 --> 00:46:54,650
the first payment you paid
was actually a deposit.

752
00:46:54,652 --> 00:46:56,686
Wasn't it?
It's like we said.

753
00:46:56,688 --> 00:46:57,887
So, actually,
in point of fact,

754
00:46:57,889 --> 00:47:00,922
you're actually behind
in your payments now,

755
00:47:00,924 --> 00:47:03,291
by, yeah, a month.

756
00:47:03,293 --> 00:47:04,860
Yeah, that's, uh...

757
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:09,498
It's what the contract says,
looking over it and all.

758
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:12,300
The lawyer says so too.

759
00:47:12,302 --> 00:47:14,538
When you need
this next payment by, Red?

760
00:47:16,873 --> 00:47:18,375
Well, now, really.

761
00:47:21,413 --> 00:47:24,315
Or by... Uh...

762
00:47:25,081 --> 00:47:26,282
Friday?

763
00:47:26,284 --> 00:47:28,083
Wow.

764
00:47:28,085 --> 00:47:29,585
When you can't
trust the lawyers

765
00:47:29,587 --> 00:47:30,686
and the advertising men,

766
00:47:30,688 --> 00:47:33,288
what the hell's America
coming to, huh?

767
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,190
Who got to you, Red?

768
00:47:35,192 --> 00:47:36,891
Willoughby?

769
00:47:36,893 --> 00:47:38,126
Nobody got to me.

770
00:47:38,128 --> 00:47:39,797
My fat fucking ass.

771
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:43,898
He's dying, Mildred.

772
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:46,469
We're all fucking dying!

773
00:47:46,471 --> 00:47:48,270
Hi, Pamela.
We're a little bit busy

774
00:47:48,272 --> 00:47:50,105
at the moment,
if that's okay.

775
00:47:50,107 --> 00:47:51,607
I know you were
real anxious

776
00:47:51,609 --> 00:47:53,041
about talking to Mrs. Hayes
this morning...

777
00:47:53,043 --> 00:47:54,009
Anxious? No.

778
00:47:54,011 --> 00:47:57,212
No need to be, because
you won't believe it!

779
00:47:57,214 --> 00:48:00,416
A little Mexican delivery boy
just dropped in with this.

780
00:48:00,418 --> 00:48:01,650
What the hell is this?

781
00:48:01,652 --> 00:48:02,583
I know!

782
00:48:02,585 --> 00:48:04,822
It's $5,000! And guess
what the note says?

783
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:08,857
It says to pay for the rental
on Mrs. Hayes's billboards.

784
00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:11,259
Can you believe it?
That's why I butted in.

785
00:48:11,261 --> 00:48:12,393
Who's it from?

786
00:48:12,395 --> 00:48:13,762
Doesn't say.

787
00:48:13,764 --> 00:48:16,331
- Well, where's the delivery boy?
- He went.

788
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:18,103
Did you see what company
he was from?

789
00:48:18,735 --> 00:48:19,634
No.

790
00:48:19,636 --> 00:48:22,237
What kind of uniform
did he have on?

791
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:23,471
Well, he just looked
like one of those

792
00:48:23,473 --> 00:48:25,542
fat little Mexican boys.

793
00:48:26,076 --> 00:48:27,111
On a bicycle.

794
00:48:30,281 --> 00:48:31,480
Did I do
something wrong?

795
00:48:31,482 --> 00:48:33,148
No, Pam,
you did good.

796
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:35,416
Yeah, Pamela,
you did real good.

797
00:48:35,418 --> 00:48:37,585
Did I? Oh, great.

798
00:48:37,587 --> 00:48:40,090
Ain't life crazy?

799
00:48:45,196 --> 00:48:46,531
What's the note say, Red?

800
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,701
Says, "This here money
is to go towards the fund

801
00:48:52,703 --> 00:48:54,469
"for Mildred Hayes's
billboards,

802
00:48:54,471 --> 00:48:56,471
"because she ain't
the only one 'round here

803
00:48:56,473 --> 00:48:58,907
"who hates the pigs.
Signed, a friend."

804
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:01,110
I guess you can't be too picky
about who your friends are

805
00:49:01,112 --> 00:49:02,113
these days, huh?

806
00:49:02,813 --> 00:49:04,913
Uh-huh, um...

807
00:49:04,915 --> 00:49:07,782
I guess I'll be needing
a receipt off you there, Red,

808
00:49:07,784 --> 00:49:09,617
you know, saying the price
of next month

809
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:11,719
is paid in full and all.

810
00:49:11,721 --> 00:49:13,624
Oh, sure, Mildred, sure.

811
00:49:14,792 --> 00:49:15,858
Like now.

812
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,925
Oh, sure.

813
00:49:21,264 --> 00:49:22,898
Is Mommy drunk, Daddy?

814
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,733
No. She's just got a
little migraine, is all.

815
00:49:25,735 --> 00:49:27,969
Little Chardonnay
migraine.

816
00:49:27,971 --> 00:49:31,706
Now, no more chit-chat
outta you two, okay?

817
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:34,809
Can we stay home from school
again tomorrow, Daddy?

818
00:49:34,811 --> 00:49:37,913
We'll see what your mommy
says in the morning, darling.

819
00:49:37,915 --> 00:49:39,313
Aw!

820
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:41,453
Eyes closed

821
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:44,656
and go to sleep, okay?

822
00:49:57,567 --> 00:50:01,335
You don't smell like puke,
which is good.

823
00:50:01,337 --> 00:50:04,239
Aquafresh.
Trick I learned.

824
00:50:04,241 --> 00:50:05,976
Women, huh?

825
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,811
But it's still your turn
to clean the horseshit

826
00:50:09,813 --> 00:50:11,346
outta the stable,
you know.

827
00:50:11,348 --> 00:50:14,449
Those fucking horses.

828
00:50:14,451 --> 00:50:15,951
They're your fucking horses.

829
00:50:15,953 --> 00:50:18,223
I'm gonna have those
fucking horses shot!

830
00:50:19,322 --> 00:50:23,157
I'll do it,
you lazy bitch.

831
00:50:23,159 --> 00:50:24,793
Thank you, Poppa.

832
00:50:27,665 --> 00:50:29,868
That was a real nice day.

833
00:50:31,601 --> 00:50:34,004
That was a real nice fuck.

834
00:50:37,107 --> 00:50:39,474
You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby.

835
00:50:44,014 --> 00:50:46,014
Is that from a play?

836
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:48,050
"You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby."

837
00:50:48,052 --> 00:50:52,020
I think I heard that
in a Shakespeare one time.

838
00:50:52,022 --> 00:50:54,155
You dummy.

839
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:56,027
It's Oscar Wilde.

840
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:57,761
Ah.

841
00:51:51,415 --> 00:51:53,217
Oscar Wilde.

842
00:52:21,877 --> 00:52:23,645
<i>My darling Anne,</i>

843
00:52:23,647 --> 00:52:25,813
<i>there's a longer letter
in the dresser drawer</i>

844
00:52:25,815 --> 00:52:28,116
<i>I've been writing
for the last week or so.</i>

845
00:52:28,118 --> 00:52:31,853
<i>That one covers us
and my memories of us</i>

846
00:52:31,855 --> 00:52:34,355
<i>and how much
I've always loved you.</i>

847
00:52:34,357 --> 00:52:39,128
<i>This one just covers tonight,
and more importantly, today.</i>

848
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,197
<i>Tonight I've gone out
to the horses to end it.</i>

849
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:44,933
<i>I cannot say sorry
for the act itself,</i>

850
00:52:44,935 --> 00:52:46,735
<i>although I know
that for a short time</i>

851
00:52:46,737 --> 00:52:49,070
<i>you will be angry at me
or even hate me for it.</i>

852
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,773
<i>Please don't.</i>

853
00:52:51,775 --> 00:52:55,076
<i>This is not a case of,
"I came in this world alone</i>

854
00:52:55,078 --> 00:52:56,478
<i>"and I'm going
out of it alone,"</i>

855
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,713
<i>or anything dumb like that.</i>

856
00:52:58,715 --> 00:53:01,116
<i>I did not come
in this world alone,</i>

857
00:53:01,118 --> 00:53:02,717
<i>my mom was there.</i>

858
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:05,454
<i>And I am not
going out of it alone,</i>

859
00:53:05,456 --> 00:53:06,755
<i>because you are there,</i>

860
00:53:06,757 --> 00:53:11,826
<i>drunk on the couch,
making Oscar Wilde cock jokes.</i>

861
00:53:11,828 --> 00:53:14,963
<i>No, this is a case,
in some senses, of bravery.</i>

862
00:53:14,965 --> 00:53:17,699
<i>Not the bravery
of facing a bullet down.</i>

863
00:53:17,701 --> 00:53:19,166
<i>The next few months of pain</i>

864
00:53:19,168 --> 00:53:22,770
<i>would be far harder
than that small flash.</i>

865
00:53:22,772 --> 00:53:24,940
<i>No, it's the bravery
of weighing up</i>

866
00:53:24,942 --> 00:53:27,976
<i>the next few months
of still being with you,</i>

867
00:53:27,978 --> 00:53:32,181
<i>still waking up with you,
of playing with the kids</i>

868
00:53:32,183 --> 00:53:34,949
<i>against the next few months
of seeing in your eyes</i>

869
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:37,652
<i>how much my pain
is killing you,</i>

870
00:53:37,654 --> 00:53:40,556
<i>how my weakened body,
as it ebbs away,</i>

871
00:53:40,558 --> 00:53:42,123
<i>and you tend to it,</i>

872
00:53:42,125 --> 00:53:45,828
<i>are your final and lasting
memories of me.</i>

873
00:53:45,830 --> 00:53:48,262
<i>I won't have that.</i>

874
00:53:48,264 --> 00:53:51,565
<i>Your final memories of me
will be us at the riverside</i>

875
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:55,670
<i>and that dumb fishing game,
which I think they cheated at,</i>

876
00:53:55,672 --> 00:53:59,241
<i>and me inside of you
and you on top of me</i>

877
00:53:59,243 --> 00:54:04,480
<i>and barely a fleeting thought
of the darkness yet to come.</i>

878
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:06,146
<i>That was the best, Anne.</i>

879
00:54:06,148 --> 00:54:09,585
<i>A whole day
of not thinking about it.</i>

880
00:54:09,587 --> 00:54:11,253
<i>Dwell on this day, baby,</i>

881
00:54:11,255 --> 00:54:14,590
<i>because it was the best day
of my life.</i>

882
00:54:14,592 --> 00:54:16,056
<i>Kiss the girls for me,</i>

883
00:54:16,058 --> 00:54:18,092
<i>and know that
I've always loved you,</i>

884
00:54:18,094 --> 00:54:21,029
<i>and maybe I'll see you again
if there's another place.</i>

885
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:25,235
<i>And if there ain't, well,
it's been heaven knowing you.</i>

886
00:54:27,304 --> 00:54:28,906
<i>Your boy,</i>

887
00:54:30,273 --> 00:54:31,409
<i>Bill.</i>

888
00:55:27,163 --> 00:55:29,665
What the hell's
going on around here?

889
00:55:33,571 --> 00:55:34,839
What?

890
00:56:02,898 --> 00:56:04,835
Can you stand now?

891
00:56:05,601 --> 00:56:07,469
Yeah, I can stand.

892
00:56:10,706 --> 00:56:13,108
I'd better
get out there,

893
00:56:13,110 --> 00:56:16,011
say something to them.

894
00:56:16,013 --> 00:56:18,215
You ain't gonna
faint again, are you?

895
00:56:45,976 --> 00:56:49,578
<i>I know
that the best thing,</i>

896
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:53,815
<i>the only thing to honor
that man's memory right now</i>

897
00:56:53,817 --> 00:56:55,518
<i>is to go to work.</i>

898
00:56:56,453 --> 00:56:59,357
<i>Is to be a good cop.</i>

899
00:57:00,857 --> 00:57:03,157
<i>To walk in his shoes</i>

900
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:06,096
<i>and do what he did
every day of his life.</i>

901
00:57:06,864 --> 00:57:07,996
<i>Help people.</i>

902
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,066
What the hell's going on?

903
00:57:59,049 --> 00:58:00,382
Where are you going, boy?

904
00:58:06,257 --> 00:58:09,961
You fucking pig!
What the fuck are you?

905
00:58:10,793 --> 00:58:12,263
Shut up.

906
00:58:32,982 --> 00:58:36,987
See, Red, I got issues
with white folks too.

907
00:58:43,226 --> 00:58:45,196
Fuck you looking at?

908
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:00,474
<i>Reports,
sadly, have come in overnight,</i>

909
00:59:00,476 --> 00:59:03,043
<i>that Chief William Willoughby
of Ebbing, Missouri</i>

910
00:59:03,045 --> 00:59:05,346
<i>took his own life
early this morning</i>

911
00:59:05,348 --> 00:59:06,748
<i>in the grounds of his home.</i>

912
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:09,585
<i>This report just in
from Gabriella Forrester.</i>

913
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:11,251
<i>Tragedy
came calling today</i>

914
00:59:11,253 --> 00:59:14,822
<i>upon this quiet family home
outside Ebbing, Missouri,</i>

915
00:59:14,824 --> 00:59:17,257
belonging to
Chief Willoughby,

916
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:19,661
his wife, Anne,
their two young daughters,

917
00:59:19,663 --> 00:59:21,329
Polly and Jane.

918
00:59:21,331 --> 00:59:23,732
<i>What appears to be a
self-inflicted gunshot wound</i>

919
00:59:23,734 --> 00:59:26,268
<i>brought life to an end
for Chief Willoughby,</i>

920
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:28,270
<i>a man highly-respected
in Ebbing</i>

921
00:59:28,272 --> 00:59:31,271
<i>for his diligence
and service to the community.</i>

922
00:59:31,273 --> 00:59:33,041
<i>What led him to take his life</i>

923
00:59:33,043 --> 00:59:34,741
<i>in the early hours
of this morning,</i>

924
00:59:34,743 --> 00:59:36,844
<i>it is too early to speculate.</i>

925
00:59:36,846 --> 00:59:38,378
<i>There were rumors of illness.</i>

926
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,748
<i>Could it simply have been
the pressures of the job?</i>

927
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:43,518
<i>Or could it have something
to do with a story</i>

928
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:46,188
<i>we ran here
just two weeks ago</i>

929
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,556

<i>Mildred Hayes?</i>

932
01:00:01,772 --> 01:00:03,373
Don't. Don't!

933
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,682
Hi, there.

934
01:00:13,917 --> 01:00:15,382
You know
who threw that can?

935
01:00:15,384 --> 01:00:16,386
What can?

936
01:00:19,255 --> 01:00:21,690
How about you, sweetheart?
You know who threw that can?

937
01:00:21,692 --> 01:00:23,123
Uh, no, I didn't see.

938
01:00:32,802 --> 01:00:33,804
Thank you, Mom.

939
01:00:45,581 --> 01:00:48,282
And what can I do
for you today, sir?

940
01:00:48,284 --> 01:00:49,652
What's your name?

941
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:55,190
Name's on my tag, man.
You hard of reading?

942
01:00:55,192 --> 01:00:57,458
Hard of reading?
No, no.

943
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,960
That's good,
"hard of reading".

944
01:00:58,962 --> 01:01:00,328
Kinda like
"hard of hearing",

945
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:02,663
but it's actually
"hard of reading".

946
01:01:02,665 --> 01:01:04,534
Like a play on words
or something, huh?

947
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:07,302
What do you want?

948
01:01:07,304 --> 01:01:09,237
I've been sent
to take over

949
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:11,172
from Chief Willoughby

950
01:01:11,174 --> 01:01:13,007
in light of last night's
unfortunate event.

951
01:01:13,009 --> 01:01:15,778
You have got to be
fucking kidding me!

952
01:01:17,547 --> 01:01:22,150
Do you have any documentation
to prove that, sir?

953
01:01:22,152 --> 01:01:24,652
You really wanna see
my documentation, fucker?

954
01:01:24,654 --> 01:01:29,159
Yeah, see his documentation!
Make him show it to you.

955
01:01:30,761 --> 01:01:33,496
None of you cracker motherfuckers
got no work to do?

956
01:01:37,132 --> 01:01:38,468
Ain't that racist?

957
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,974
What happened to your hand,
Officer Dixon?

958
01:01:45,976 --> 01:01:48,275
Oh, I just kinda

959
01:01:48,277 --> 01:01:49,576
banged it up
a little bit

960
01:01:49,578 --> 01:01:52,047
while I was throwing some guy
out a fucking window.

961
01:01:52,049 --> 01:01:53,882
You know, the usual.

962
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:54,882
Yeah?

963
01:01:54,884 --> 01:01:57,552
They never taught me
that one at the academy.

964
01:01:57,554 --> 01:02:00,224
Which fucking academy
you go to?

965
01:02:01,891 --> 01:02:05,326
How are things coming along
on that Angela Hayes case?

966
01:02:05,328 --> 01:02:06,494
How's things coming along

967
01:02:06,496 --> 01:02:08,429
on the mind your own
fucking business case?

968
01:02:08,431 --> 01:02:09,764
How are things
coming along

969
01:02:09,766 --> 01:02:11,969
on the hand me your gun
and your badge?

970
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,139
Huh?

971
01:02:17,141 --> 01:02:19,976
Hand me your gun
and your badge.

972
01:02:39,128 --> 01:02:40,531
Shit.

973
01:02:54,143 --> 01:02:55,812
It's in here somewhere.

974
01:03:03,252 --> 01:03:06,219
Hey, listen,
I can't find my badge.

975
01:03:06,221 --> 01:03:08,290
No, seriously.
Maybe I lost it.

976
01:03:08,292 --> 01:03:10,358
Dropped it when I was
doing that window guy.

977
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,464
Just get the fuck out of
my station house, man.

978
01:03:38,221 --> 01:03:40,724
What's going on?

979
01:03:42,625 --> 01:03:45,492
I think I just got fired.

980
01:03:45,494 --> 01:03:47,996
Fired or suspended,
I'm not sure which.

981
01:03:47,998 --> 01:03:49,366
Fired.

982
01:04:19,728 --> 01:04:22,366
Anything I can help you with,
just give me a holler.

983
01:04:25,435 --> 01:04:28,471
Give Mildred Hayes

984
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:30,907
a holler.

985
01:04:32,909 --> 01:04:34,078
Okay.

986
01:04:35,444 --> 01:04:37,177
You know me?

987
01:04:37,179 --> 01:04:40,384
Only from the TV
and the radio.

988
01:04:48,391 --> 01:04:49,523
How much these here

989
01:04:49,525 --> 01:04:51,759
"Welcome to Missouri"
rabbits go for?

990
01:04:51,761 --> 01:04:54,398
Seven bucks.
It's writ right on them.

991
01:05:02,471 --> 01:05:04,574
Guess he ain't
seven bucks now.

992
01:05:06,743 --> 01:05:08,275
What did you
come in here for?

993
01:05:08,277 --> 01:05:10,878
What did I
come in here for?

994
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,616
Maybe I'm a good friend of
Willoughby's, how about that?

995
01:05:14,683 --> 01:05:16,250
Are you?

996
01:05:16,252 --> 01:05:17,720
Or, you know...

997
01:05:19,755 --> 01:05:22,625
Maybe I was a friend of
your daughter or something.

998
01:05:23,393 --> 01:05:24,695
How about that?

999
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,766
Were you?

1000
01:05:31,734 --> 01:05:32,969
Or, um...

1001
01:05:35,237 --> 01:05:36,503
You know,
maybe I was the one

1002
01:05:36,505 --> 01:05:39,107
who fucked her
while she was dying.

1003
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:40,610
How about that?

1004
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,782
Were you?

1005
01:05:47,049 --> 01:05:48,151
No.

1006
01:05:49,451 --> 01:05:51,087
I would have liked to.

1007
01:05:52,589 --> 01:05:54,188
I saw her picture
in the paper there.

1008
01:05:58,293 --> 01:06:00,695
Saved by the bell, huh?

1009
01:06:00,697 --> 01:06:03,331
You owe me seven fucking
dollars for the rabbit.

1010
01:06:04,801 --> 01:06:06,300
Guess you'll have to
get it off me

1011
01:06:06,302 --> 01:06:07,835
next time
I'm passing through.

1012
01:06:07,837 --> 01:06:08,971
Guess I will.

1013
01:06:18,714 --> 01:06:21,416
You don't know how
glad I am to see you.

1014
01:06:21,418 --> 01:06:22,483
What?

1015
01:06:22,485 --> 01:06:24,018
That guy was
trying to scare me.

1016
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,554
I wouldn't have said
you scare easy.

1017
01:06:26,556 --> 01:06:28,058
I ain't the worst.

1018
01:06:29,558 --> 01:06:31,558
What can I do
for you, ma'am?

1019
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:32,759
My husband
left this for you

1020
01:06:32,761 --> 01:06:35,465
before he shot himself
in the head last night.

1021
01:06:39,703 --> 01:06:41,268
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Willoughby...

1022
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:42,605
Are you?

1023
01:06:43,272 --> 01:06:44,838
Are you really?

1024
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,976
- Sure, I am.
- Surely this is the perfect ending for you, isn't it?

1025
01:06:47,978 --> 01:06:51,212
Proof those billboards
of yours were successful,

1026
01:06:51,214 --> 01:06:53,047
a dead policeman?

1027
01:06:53,049 --> 01:06:54,549
It's quantifiable now.

1028
01:06:54,551 --> 01:06:55,916
Are you blaming
this on me?

1029
01:06:55,918 --> 01:06:57,451
No.

1030
01:06:57,453 --> 01:06:58,719
I'm not blaming
this on you.

1031
01:06:58,721 --> 01:07:00,791
I just came
to give you the letter.

1032
01:07:01,857 --> 01:07:03,757
Now my little girls
are out in the car,

1033
01:07:03,759 --> 01:07:06,629
so I'd better not
stay and chat.

1034
01:07:07,864 --> 01:07:09,329
I'm not quite sure
what we're gonna do

1035
01:07:09,331 --> 01:07:10,868
for the rest of the day.

1036
01:07:12,335 --> 01:07:14,569
It's hard to know
what to do

1037
01:07:14,571 --> 01:07:17,404
the day your husband
kills himself.

1038
01:07:17,406 --> 01:07:18,975
It's hard to know
what to do.

1039
01:07:48,871 --> 01:07:50,704
<i>Dear Mildred,</i>

1040
01:07:50,706 --> 01:07:52,773
<i>Dead Man Willoughby here.</i>

1041
01:07:52,775 --> 01:07:55,108
<i>Firstly, I wanted
to apologize for dying</i>

1042
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:57,911
<i>without catching
your daughter's killer.</i>

1043
01:07:57,913 --> 01:07:59,646
<i>It's a source
of great pain to me,</i>

1044
01:07:59,648 --> 01:08:01,449
<i>and it would
break my heart to think</i>

1045
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:05,319
<i>you thought I didn't care.
I did.</i>

1046
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:06,987
<i>There are just some cases</i>

1047
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:09,657
<i>where you never
catch a break,</i>

1048
01:08:09,659 --> 01:08:11,592
<i>then five years
down the line</i>

1049
01:08:11,594 --> 01:08:13,594
<i>some guy hears
some other guy</i>

1050
01:08:13,596 --> 01:08:17,532
<i>bragging about it
in a bar room or a jail cell</i>

1051
01:08:17,534 --> 01:08:19,134
<i>and the whole thing
is wrapped up</i>

1052
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:20,935
<i>through sheer stupidity.</i>

1053
01:08:20,937 --> 01:08:24,537
<i>I hope that might be true
for Angela, I really do.</i>

1054
01:08:24,539 --> 01:08:27,207
<i>Second, I gotta admit,
Mildred,</i>

1055
01:08:27,209 --> 01:08:30,711
<i>the billboards were
a great fucking idea.</i>

1056
01:08:30,713 --> 01:08:32,846
<i>They were like a chess move.</i>

1057
01:08:32,848 --> 01:08:35,149
<i>And although they had
absolutely nothing</i>

1058
01:08:35,151 --> 01:08:36,684
<i>to do with my dying,</i>

1059
01:08:36,686 --> 01:08:38,418
<i>I'm sure that
everyone in town</i>

1060
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,220
<i>will assume that they did,</i>

1061
01:08:40,222 --> 01:08:42,790
<i>which is why, for
Willoughby's counter-move,</i>

1062
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:45,826
<i>I decided to pay
the next month's rent on them.</i>

1063
01:08:45,828 --> 01:08:48,729
<i>I thought it would be funny,
you having to defend them</i>

1064
01:08:48,731 --> 01:08:49,896
<i>another whole month</i>

1065
01:08:49,898 --> 01:08:52,867
<i>after they've stuck me
in the ground.</i>

1066
01:08:52,869 --> 01:08:55,470
<i>The joke is on you,
Mildred, ha ha,</i>

1067
01:08:55,472 --> 01:08:57,641
<i>and I hope
they do not kill you.</i>

1068
01:08:58,574 --> 01:08:59,940
<i>So good luck with all that,</i>

1069
01:08:59,942 --> 01:09:02,779
<i>and good luck
with everything else too.</i>

1070
01:09:03,879 --> 01:09:06,782
<i>I hope and I pray
that you get him.</i>

1071
01:09:23,799 --> 01:09:27,734
Well, you want me to go
down and talk to them?

1072
01:09:27,736 --> 01:09:30,671
No, I don't want you to
go down and talk to them.

1073
01:09:30,673 --> 01:09:32,140
Somebody sending
their goddamn mother

1074
01:09:32,142 --> 01:09:34,211
down to talk
to the goddamn police?

1075
01:09:38,181 --> 01:09:39,546
To say what?

1076
01:09:39,548 --> 01:09:42,349
To say to give you
your job back.

1077
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:43,887
Get rid
of that black guy.

1078
01:09:45,489 --> 01:09:46,887
Ain't gonna listen
to some guy's mother

1079
01:09:46,889 --> 01:09:49,092
asking them to get rid
of some black guy.

1080
01:09:50,026 --> 01:09:51,824
Things have moved on
in the South.

1081
01:09:51,826 --> 01:09:53,696
Well, it shouldn't have!

1082
01:09:55,164 --> 01:09:59,169
Will they give you some money
for being laid off and all?

1083
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:03,170
I don't know what the
compensation scheme is

1084
01:10:03,172 --> 01:10:05,907
for when you throw a guy
out of a window, Ma.

1085
01:10:05,909 --> 01:10:07,641
Guess I should have
looked into that beforehand.

1086
01:10:07,643 --> 01:10:09,810
Let me Google that.

1087
01:10:09,812 --> 01:10:12,512
A couple of grand, maybe?

1088
01:10:12,514 --> 01:10:14,215
You been there three years.

1089
01:10:14,217 --> 01:10:18,155
Not counting the five years
at the academy.

1090
01:10:19,356 --> 01:10:20,653
Six,

1091
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:22,993
if you count the year
you were held back.

1092
01:10:25,462 --> 01:10:27,528
Where are you going?

1093
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:29,529
None of your business.

1094
01:10:29,531 --> 01:10:31,966
Off to see your fancy woman?

1095
01:10:31,968 --> 01:10:33,534
I don't got a fancy woman.

1096
01:10:33,536 --> 01:10:36,336
Yeah. I know.

1097
01:10:36,338 --> 01:10:38,773
Hey, you wanna
watch yourself.

1098
01:10:38,775 --> 01:10:41,011
Or, or you'll do what?

1099
01:10:44,347 --> 01:10:47,084
I'll blow your goddamn
head off, that's what.

1100
01:10:57,494 --> 01:10:59,092
Oh,
did you hear the news?

1101
01:10:59,094 --> 01:11:00,027
What news?

1102
01:11:00,029 --> 01:11:01,695
That Dixon guy
threw that Welby guy

1103
01:11:01,697 --> 01:11:03,864
out of his window
this morning.

1104
01:11:03,866 --> 01:11:05,435
You're shitting me.

1105
01:11:10,606 --> 01:11:12,305
Is he okay?

1106
01:11:12,307 --> 01:11:13,509
Mmm-mmm.

1107
01:11:18,513 --> 01:11:20,180
- You're shitting me!
- Whoa!

1108
01:11:20,182 --> 01:11:23,319
Holy shit!
Holy shit!

1109
01:11:23,753 --> 01:11:25,322
Holy shit!

1110
01:11:26,255 --> 01:11:27,324
Fuck!

1111
01:11:30,793 --> 01:11:32,192
Get the other one
from the house.

1112
01:11:32,194 --> 01:11:33,993
Shouldn't I call
the fire department?

1113
01:11:33,995 --> 01:11:36,463
Fuck them.
They probably started it.

1114
01:11:36,465 --> 01:11:38,134
Don't do anything stupid!

1115
01:11:39,502 --> 01:11:40,935
Scumbags!

1116
01:11:40,937 --> 01:11:43,340
Fucking, fucking scumbags!

1117
01:12:16,772 --> 01:12:18,206
Shit!

1118
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,509
All right!

1119
01:12:41,530 --> 01:12:43,098
Are you kidding me?

1120
01:12:48,036 --> 01:12:50,173
What the hell
are you doing?

1121
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,680
Okay. Good. Come on.

1122
01:12:59,682 --> 01:13:01,415
Leave it! Ma, please!

1123
01:13:01,417 --> 01:13:02,886
It's too late!

1124
01:13:06,054 --> 01:13:07,720
- Robbie...
- Leave it! Please!

1125
01:13:07,722 --> 01:13:09,158
Robbie!

1126
01:13:38,454 --> 01:13:40,089
How are those hands?

1127
01:13:41,991 --> 01:13:44,127
Give us a minute here.
Thank you.

1128
01:13:47,362 --> 01:13:49,262
Can I ask you
a couple of questions?

1129
01:13:49,264 --> 01:13:51,030
You can ask me all the
questions you want,

1130
01:13:51,032 --> 01:13:53,266
you take me down
and arrest me.

1131
01:13:53,268 --> 01:13:54,635
I'm not gonna arrest you,
Mrs. Hayes.

1132
01:13:54,637 --> 01:13:56,205
I got nothing
to arrest you for.

1133
01:13:58,641 --> 01:14:00,243
Not yet you ain't.

1134
01:14:06,281 --> 01:14:08,485
We ain't all the enemy,
you know.

1135
01:14:26,268 --> 01:14:30,205
I'll crucify
the motherfuckers.

1136
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:43,149
What are
you gonna do, Mildred?

1137
01:14:43,151 --> 01:14:45,086
You gonna crucify them?

1138
01:14:45,088 --> 01:14:48,288
Yeah, I'm gonna crucify them.

1139
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:50,390
Who you gonna crucify?

1140
01:14:50,392 --> 01:14:52,492
The motherfuckers?

1141
01:14:52,494 --> 01:14:54,628
Yeah, I'm gonna

1142
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:57,064
crucify the motherfuckers.

1143
01:14:57,066 --> 01:14:59,132
Ooh, then those motherfuckers

1144
01:14:59,134 --> 01:15:02,336
better watch out, all right?

1145
01:15:05,674 --> 01:15:07,276
Fucking A.

1146
01:15:11,079 --> 01:15:12,546
What's this shit?

1147
01:15:12,548 --> 01:15:14,381
And as sad as the spectacle

1148
01:15:14,383 --> 01:15:16,483
of these burned out
billboards might be,

1149
01:15:16,485 --> 01:15:18,252
in light of the death
of Chief Willoughby,

1150
01:15:18,254 --> 01:15:19,820
this reporter for one

1151
01:15:19,822 --> 01:15:21,220
wonders if this
finally puts an end

1152
01:15:21,222 --> 01:15:23,791
to the strange saga
of the three billboards...

1153
01:15:23,793 --> 01:15:26,092
This doesn't put an end
to shit, you fucking retard,

1154
01:15:26,094 --> 01:15:27,728
this is just
the fucking start!

1155
01:15:27,730 --> 01:15:28,962
Why don't you
put that on your

1156
01:15:28,964 --> 01:15:32,201
<i>Good Morning Missouri</i> fucking
<i>Wake Up</i> broadcast, bitch!

1157
01:15:41,576 --> 01:15:44,244
I see on the TV there
were a bunch of fires

1158
01:15:44,246 --> 01:15:46,482
lit outside of town
last night.

1159
01:15:48,151 --> 01:15:49,753
Bunch of fires, huh?

1160
01:15:50,753 --> 01:15:53,023
Out at those billboards.

1161
01:15:54,557 --> 01:15:56,524
Back when I was a cop
I would have been

1162
01:15:56,526 --> 01:15:58,257
interested in
who set those fires,

1163
01:15:58,259 --> 01:16:00,293
because, technically,
that's arson,

1164
01:16:00,295 --> 01:16:02,195
but as I'm no longer
employed by those people,

1165
01:16:02,197 --> 01:16:04,732
I don't really
give a goddamn.

1166
01:16:07,636 --> 01:16:09,105
I'll get it.

1167
01:16:14,477 --> 01:16:15,576
Dixon residence.

1168
01:16:15,578 --> 01:16:17,545
<i>Hey, Dixon, it's Cedric.</i>

1169
01:16:17,547 --> 01:16:21,082
Oh, hey, Sarge.
You got any news?

1170
01:16:21,084 --> 01:16:23,219
- <i>News about what?</i>
- I don't know.

1171
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:27,889
About my job and stuff?

1172
01:16:27,891 --> 01:16:30,257
No. No. What?

1173
01:16:30,259 --> 01:16:31,558
No.

1174
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:35,162
Anne Willoughby
just dropped in a letter

1175
01:16:35,164 --> 01:16:36,898
that Bill wrote you
before he died.

1176
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:38,299
What's it say?

1177
01:16:38,301 --> 01:16:40,967
I haven't read it,
it's not my letter.

1178
01:16:40,969 --> 01:16:42,903
Oh, well, listen,
I'll come right down.

1179
01:16:42,905 --> 01:16:45,538
Um, I'll be there
in like 15 minutes.

1180
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:47,373
Well... Uh...

1181
01:16:47,375 --> 01:16:52,912
Not such a great idea,
things as they stand, Jason.

1182
01:16:52,914 --> 01:16:54,348
<i>You still got your keys</i>

1183
01:16:54,350 --> 01:16:56,516
<i>to the station house,
though, right?</i>

1184
01:16:56,518 --> 01:16:57,484
Yeah.

1185
01:16:57,486 --> 01:16:59,920
<i>Why don't you
come and pick it up</i>

1186
01:16:59,922 --> 01:17:02,256
<i>after everyone's gone home?</i>

1187
01:17:02,258 --> 01:17:04,494
<i>I can leave it
on your desk for you.</i>

1188
01:17:05,794 --> 01:17:07,193
Oh, okay.

1189
01:17:07,195 --> 01:17:08,730
<i>Actually, yeah, then</i>

1190
01:17:09,398 --> 01:17:11,534
when you're done, you can

1191
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,600
just leave the keys,

1192
01:17:14,602 --> 01:17:17,272
you know, save us
picking them up later.

1193
01:17:19,907 --> 01:17:21,244
All right.

1194
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,970
<i>Jason, Willoughby here.</i>

1195
01:17:50,972 --> 01:17:53,439
<i>I'm dead now,
sorry about that.</i>

1196
01:17:53,441 --> 01:17:55,141
<i>There's something
I wanted to say to you</i>

1197
01:17:55,143 --> 01:17:57,646
<i>that I never really said
when I was alive.</i>

1198
01:17:59,114 --> 01:18:00,648
<i>I think you've got the makings</i>

1199
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,717
<i>of being
a really good cop, Jason.</i>

1200
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:05,187
<i>And you know why?</i>

1201
01:18:06,422 --> 01:18:10,323
<i>Because deep down
you're a decent man.</i>

1202
01:18:10,325 --> 01:18:12,393
<i>I know you don't think
I think that,</i>

1203
01:18:12,395 --> 01:18:14,429
<i>but I do, dipshit.</i>

1204
01:18:21,437 --> 01:18:23,907
<i>I do think
you're too angry, though.</i>

1205
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:28,442
<i>And I know it's all
since your dad died,</i>

1206
01:18:28,444 --> 01:18:31,414
<i>and you had to go
look after your mom.</i>

1207
01:18:34,150 --> 01:18:37,283
<i>But as long as you hold on
to so much hate,</i>

1208
01:18:37,285 --> 01:18:40,086
<i>then I don't think
you're ever gonna become</i>

1209
01:18:40,088 --> 01:18:42,424
<i>what I know
you wanna become.</i>

1210
01:18:45,027 --> 01:18:46,560
<i>A detective.</i>

1211
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:55,168
<i>Because you know what you
need to become a detective?</i>

1212
01:18:56,572 --> 01:18:59,073
<i>And I know you're gonna wince
when I say this...</i>

1213
01:19:00,976 --> 01:19:06,449
<i>But what you need to become
a detective is love.</i>

1214
01:19:07,182 --> 01:19:08,384
Fuck 'em.

1215
01:19:15,523 --> 01:19:18,192
<i>Because through love
comes calm,</i>

1216
01:19:18,194 --> 01:19:20,827
<i>and through calm
comes thought.</i>

1217
01:19:20,829 --> 01:19:24,701
<i>And you need thought to detect
stuff sometimes, Jason.</i>

1218
01:19:30,205 --> 01:19:32,238
<i>It's kinda all you need.</i>

1219
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:33,808
<i>You don't even need a gun.</i>

1220
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:36,443
<i>And you definitely
don't need hate.</i>

1221
01:19:36,445 --> 01:19:38,414
<i>Hate never solved nothing.</i>

1222
01:19:43,451 --> 01:19:45,818
<i>But calm did.
And thought did.</i>

1223
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:48,690
<i>Try it. Try it
just for a change.</i>

1224
01:19:50,392 --> 01:19:51,958
<i>No one will think
you're gay.</i>

1225
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:55,261
<i>And if they do,
arrest them for homophobia.</i>

1226
01:19:55,263 --> 01:19:58,299
<i>Won't they be surprised.</i>

1227
01:19:58,301 --> 01:20:01,400
<i>Good luck to you, Jason,
you're a decent man.</i>

1228
01:20:01,402 --> 01:20:04,273
<i>And yeah, you've had
a run of bad luck,</i>

1229
01:20:05,508 --> 01:20:08,978
<i>but things are gonna change for you.
I can feel it.</i>

1230
01:20:39,008 --> 01:20:40,076
Calm.

1231
01:20:41,142 --> 01:20:42,444
Calm.

1232
01:20:43,879 --> 01:20:44,947
Calm.

1233
01:22:05,861 --> 01:22:06,894
What did you see?

1234
01:22:06,896 --> 01:22:09,395
When we turned the corner
from Spring,

1235
01:22:09,397 --> 01:22:11,765
the fire was
already raging, and

1236
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:13,900
about two seconds later
the cop fella,

1237
01:22:13,902 --> 01:22:15,269
he just jumps
out of the window.

1238
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:19,142
Wait... The two of you turned
the corner from Spring?

1239
01:22:20,174 --> 01:22:21,442
Where were you
before this?

1240
01:22:21,444 --> 01:22:22,879
Round my place.

1241
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:27,984
You two boyfriend
and girlfriend?

1242
01:22:30,419 --> 01:22:32,088
Early stages, you know.

1243
01:22:33,521 --> 01:22:35,055
Is that right?

1244
01:22:35,057 --> 01:22:36,726
We had a couple of dates.

1245
01:22:46,736 --> 01:22:49,071
You wanna go out to
dinner with me next week?

1246
01:22:50,405 --> 01:22:52,607
Yeah, I'll go out
to dinner with you.

1247
01:22:55,244 --> 01:22:56,879
But I ain't gonna
fuck you.

1248
01:22:57,879 --> 01:23:00,750
Well, I... I ain't gonna
fuck you neither.

1249
01:23:03,151 --> 01:23:04,620
I guess.

1250
01:23:18,968 --> 01:23:22,138
Burn victim. He's
pretty heavily sedated.

1251
01:23:31,446 --> 01:23:34,314
Hey, man.
You doing okay?

1252
01:23:34,316 --> 01:23:38,788
Jeez, you got burned up
pretty bad, huh?

1253
01:23:41,056 --> 01:23:42,792
You'll be okay though.

1254
01:23:43,825 --> 01:23:46,561
You want a glass
of orange juice?

1255
01:23:47,294 --> 01:23:48,929
I got a straw somewhere.

1256
01:23:50,331 --> 01:23:51,801
Hey, hey...

1257
01:23:52,901 --> 01:23:54,169
Don't cry.

1258
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:57,806
You'll be okay.

1259
01:24:00,642 --> 01:24:02,712
I'm sorry, Welby.

1260
01:24:06,181 --> 01:24:07,280
You know me?

1261
01:24:07,282 --> 01:24:08,651
I'm sorry.

1262
01:24:11,053 --> 01:24:13,022
You're sorry for what?

1263
01:24:14,656 --> 01:24:16,691
Throwing you
out the window.

1264
01:24:24,232 --> 01:24:25,466
Sorry.

1265
01:24:25,468 --> 01:24:27,400
I don't care!

1266
01:24:27,402 --> 01:24:30,403
Stop fucking crying,
God damn it!

1267
01:24:30,405 --> 01:24:32,773
The salt will just
fuck up your wounds.

1268
01:24:32,775 --> 01:24:35,708
I thought it was
good for wounds.

1269
01:24:35,710 --> 01:24:37,914
What am I,
a fucking doctor?

1270
01:25:47,482 --> 01:25:48,814
Who is it?

1271
01:25:48,816 --> 01:25:50,919
Oh, you don't
know me really.

1272
01:25:53,688 --> 01:25:55,822
Well, what do you want?

1273
01:25:55,824 --> 01:25:58,158
I come about the billboards.

1274
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,493
What about them?

1275
01:25:59,495 --> 01:26:01,060
They got burned up.

1276
01:26:01,062 --> 01:26:02,863
I know that.

1277
01:26:02,865 --> 01:26:05,935
I'm one of the guys who put
them up in the first place.

1278
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:10,805
Jerome.

1279
01:26:12,606 --> 01:26:14,306
What can I do
for you, Jerome?

1280
01:26:14,308 --> 01:26:16,577
When you put up a bunch
of posters like that...

1281
01:26:16,579 --> 01:26:20,145
Just in case any of them get
screwed up or torn, they...

1282
01:26:20,147 --> 01:26:22,817
Give you a set of
duplicates, you know?

1283
01:26:23,785 --> 01:26:25,421
No, I didn't know that.

1284
01:26:33,995 --> 01:26:36,998
Ladder's pretty steady
as it is there, James.

1285
01:26:38,667 --> 01:26:41,201
That's okay.
I like holding ladders.

1286
01:26:41,203 --> 01:26:42,338
Takes me out of myself.

1287
01:26:47,609 --> 01:26:49,109
- Need a hand?
- Hey.

1288
01:26:50,145 --> 01:26:52,512
- When did you get out?
- An hour ago.

1289
01:26:52,514 --> 01:26:53,747
Judge threw it out.

1290
01:26:53,749 --> 01:26:55,381
Said the arrest report
weren't filled out right.

1291
01:26:55,383 --> 01:26:56,852
Mmm.

1292
01:26:57,352 --> 01:26:58,387
Say, you...

1293
01:27:02,124 --> 01:27:04,925
You didn't burn down the
police station, did you?

1294
01:27:04,927 --> 01:27:07,295
No, she was with me
the whole night.

1295
01:27:09,231 --> 01:27:11,398
- Why would you...
- It's a long story.

1296
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,902
Hey.

1297
01:27:13,235 --> 01:27:15,034
Hey.

1298
01:27:15,036 --> 01:27:16,702
Still wanna put up
the Willoughby one,

1299
01:27:16,704 --> 01:27:18,270
him being dead and all?

1300
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,674
Why not?
He paid for it.

1301
01:27:20,676 --> 01:27:21,977
True.

1302
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:36,292
Look at this
fucking asshole.

1303
01:28:11,726 --> 01:28:13,896
- First round is on you?
- Yeah.

1304
01:28:29,878 --> 01:28:31,413
Well, here we are.

1305
01:28:33,581 --> 01:28:35,183
Here we are.

1306
01:28:37,386 --> 01:28:38,885
I like cheesy things.

1307
01:28:38,887 --> 01:28:40,822
I'm gonna look
for cheesy things.

1308
01:28:41,757 --> 01:28:42,991
All right.

1309
01:28:49,763 --> 01:28:51,598
Who's that?

1310
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,166
My ex-husband.

1311
01:28:53,168 --> 01:28:55,404
And his
19-year-old girlfriend.

1312
01:28:58,639 --> 01:28:59,773
You wanna leave?

1313
01:28:59,775 --> 01:29:02,244
No, no. Deal's a deal.

1314
01:29:04,780 --> 01:29:06,078
It was fucking wild.

1315
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:08,348
I think I was certifiably
fucking insane

1316
01:29:08,350 --> 01:29:09,485
for a while back then.

1317
01:29:10,218 --> 01:29:11,818
When was this?

1318
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:13,420
About nine,
ten months ago.

1319
01:29:13,422 --> 01:29:14,420
Were you on your own?

1320
01:29:14,422 --> 01:29:16,390
I had a couple
of buddies with me.

1321
01:29:16,392 --> 01:29:18,390
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1322
01:29:18,392 --> 01:29:20,560
They fuck her too?

1323
01:29:20,562 --> 01:29:23,697
I think they got their
kicks just watching, you know.

1324
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:25,265
Oh, yeah?

1325
01:29:25,267 --> 01:29:26,466
Yeah.

1326
01:29:26,468 --> 01:29:27,734
Was she hot?

1327
01:29:27,736 --> 01:29:29,970
Once the gasoline
kicked in she was hot.

1328
01:29:31,139 --> 01:29:32,805
Swear, I wanted
to fuck her even more

1329
01:29:32,807 --> 01:29:34,342
right then and there.

1330
01:29:35,945 --> 01:29:38,511
I don't know if I could
get that out of my mind.

1331
01:30:19,722 --> 01:30:21,086
I ain't going down
for that shit,

1332
01:30:21,088 --> 01:30:23,057
last fucking day
down there.

1333
01:30:30,097 --> 01:30:32,165
He been there
the whole time?

1334
01:30:32,167 --> 01:30:33,300
Who?

1335
01:30:33,302 --> 01:30:36,403
Burnt face Jake. Keeps
fucking walking up and down.

1336
01:30:36,405 --> 01:30:38,340
I don't know.
I don't think so.

1337
01:30:46,647 --> 01:30:48,116
- Another round?
- Yeah.

1338
01:30:51,652 --> 01:30:52,987
Eight bucks.

1339
01:31:25,285 --> 01:31:26,387
Maestro.

1340
01:31:31,258 --> 01:31:32,926
Can I help you
with something?

1341
01:31:32,928 --> 01:31:34,460
Excuse me?

1342
01:31:34,462 --> 01:31:36,229
Looking over here
all fucking night.

1343
01:31:36,231 --> 01:31:38,198
Unless you've got
something to say,

1344
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:39,899
why don't you take
your burnt fucking face

1345
01:31:39,901 --> 01:31:41,236
and get the fuck
out of here?

1346
01:31:44,405 --> 01:31:45,738
What are you doing?

1347
01:31:45,740 --> 01:31:48,507
Wait, wait, wait...

1348
01:31:48,509 --> 01:31:52,146
Just trust me, okay?
Do you like magic?

1349
01:31:55,683 --> 01:31:56,815
Just trust me.

1350
01:31:56,817 --> 01:31:58,454
Just do the fucking
trick, man.

1351
01:32:00,254 --> 01:32:01,289
Okay.

1352
01:32:10,098 --> 01:32:11,299
What the fuck!

1353
01:32:14,203 --> 01:32:15,270
Hey.

1354
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:17,502
Hey!

1355
01:32:17,504 --> 01:32:19,838
- That's enough!
- What's it to you, fucker?

1356
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,073
Guy is a cop, man.
He's a cop.

1357
01:32:21,075 --> 01:32:23,242
Oh, yeah?

1358
01:32:23,244 --> 01:32:24,713
He ain't wearing
no badge.

1359
01:32:25,446 --> 01:32:26,748
I lost my badge.

1360
01:32:28,348 --> 01:32:30,448
Can't remember
where I lost it.

1361
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:33,254
You started this.
I didn't do shit to you!

1362
01:32:33,989 --> 01:32:35,521
I know I started it.

1363
01:32:35,523 --> 01:32:38,123
I scratched you up
like a bitch.

1364
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:39,891
That's exactly
fucking right.

1365
01:32:56,645 --> 01:32:58,781
I'm gonna go use
the little boy's room.

1366
01:33:10,191 --> 01:33:11,491
You got something
to say to me?

1367
01:33:11,493 --> 01:33:13,426
If I'd known, we could
have double dated.

1368
01:33:13,428 --> 01:33:16,528
Doesn't shit girl
have a curfew weeknights?

1369
01:33:16,530 --> 01:33:17,697
No.

1370
01:33:17,699 --> 01:33:20,866
I was gonna take her
to the circus later,

1371
01:33:20,868 --> 01:33:22,068
but there's no need now.

1372
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:23,470
Does he juggle?

1373
01:33:23,472 --> 01:33:27,006
I'm having dinner
because he did me a favor.

1374
01:33:27,008 --> 01:33:28,942
You don't
have to explain

1375
01:33:28,944 --> 01:33:30,510
why you're having dinner
with a midget.

1376
01:33:30,512 --> 01:33:32,479
I'm not explaining
myself to you.

1377
01:33:32,481 --> 01:33:33,749
You kind of are.

1378
01:33:38,687 --> 01:33:41,186
I didn't come here
to break your balls.

1379
01:33:41,188 --> 01:33:43,624
You can date as many
midgets as you want.

1380
01:33:45,293 --> 01:33:48,694
I came to say
I was sorry, actually.

1381
01:33:48,696 --> 01:33:50,329
Sorry for what?

1382
01:33:50,331 --> 01:33:52,465
Sorry about what happened
to your billboards and all.

1383
01:33:52,467 --> 01:33:55,667
It's all water under
the bridge, I guess.

1384
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:57,036
Good.

1385
01:33:57,038 --> 01:33:58,537
I'm glad.
I was pretty drunk,

1386
01:33:58,539 --> 01:34:01,209
but it still
don't excuse it.

1387
01:34:02,945 --> 01:34:05,478
All this anger, man.

1388
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:08,413
Penelope said to me
the other day...

1389
01:34:08,415 --> 01:34:11,486
"It just begets
greater anger."

1390
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:14,690
You know? It's true.

1391
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:19,194
Penelope
said "begets"?

1392
01:34:20,628 --> 01:34:21,697
Yeah.

1393
01:34:22,463 --> 01:34:25,199
"It begets
greater anger."

1394
01:34:28,002 --> 01:34:29,735
Well...

1395
01:34:29,737 --> 01:34:33,038
You take care of this
little lady, okay, sport?

1396
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:35,710
Big lady
compared to you, right?

1397
01:34:45,285 --> 01:34:48,186
- You all right?
- I think I wanna go home now.

1398
01:34:48,188 --> 01:34:49,387
Don't give me
any shit, James.

1399
01:34:49,389 --> 01:34:51,459
We'll do it another night,
all right?

1400
01:34:52,259 --> 01:34:54,126
Why would I want to?

1401
01:34:54,128 --> 01:34:57,630
You've been embarrassed
ever since we arrived.

1402
01:34:57,632 --> 01:35:00,131
For Christ sake.
I didn't force you

1403
01:35:00,133 --> 01:35:03,171
to come on this date.
You forced me.

1404
01:35:04,905 --> 01:35:06,307
Forced you?

1405
01:35:07,508 --> 01:35:09,641
I asked you on a date.

1406
01:35:09,643 --> 01:35:12,077
Wow. You know...

1407
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:16,382
I know I'm
not that much of a catch.

1408
01:35:16,384 --> 01:35:18,818
I know I'm a dwarf
who sells used cars

1409
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:20,952
and has a drinking problem.

1410
01:35:20,954 --> 01:35:22,555
But who the hell
are you, man?

1411
01:35:22,557 --> 01:35:24,791
You're that
billboard lady who

1412
01:35:24,793 --> 01:35:25,891
never smiles,

1413
01:35:25,893 --> 01:35:28,260
never has a good word
to say about anybody,

1414
01:35:28,262 --> 01:35:30,063
and who,
in the evening times,

1415
01:35:30,065 --> 01:35:31,866
sets fucking fire
to police stations!

1416
01:35:33,535 --> 01:35:36,738
And I'm the one
who's not a catch?

1417
01:35:38,705 --> 01:35:39,740
Hey!

1418
01:35:41,542 --> 01:35:45,213
You know, I didn't have to
come and hold your ladder.

1419
01:36:10,871 --> 01:36:12,540
Now, don't make a scene.

1420
01:36:15,043 --> 01:36:18,877
Did you really tell him
"Anger begets greater anger"?

1421
01:36:18,879 --> 01:36:20,747
Oh! Yes! I did.

1422
01:36:20,749 --> 01:36:22,348
I didn't make it up
myself though.

1423
01:36:22,350 --> 01:36:23,582
I can't claim that.

1424
01:36:23,584 --> 01:36:25,987
No, I read it
on a bookmark.

1425
01:36:27,588 --> 01:36:29,624
Which was in a book
I was reading.

1426
01:36:30,991 --> 01:36:32,460
About polio.

1427
01:36:33,594 --> 01:36:36,363
Polo. No. Which is the
one with the horses?

1428
01:36:36,365 --> 01:36:37,697
Polio or polo?

1429
01:36:37,699 --> 01:36:38,967
- Polo.
- Polo.

1430
01:36:50,011 --> 01:36:51,812
Be nice to her,
Charlie.

1431
01:36:53,748 --> 01:36:54,982
You got that?

1432
01:37:08,295 --> 01:37:10,395
Jason!

1433
01:37:10,397 --> 01:37:12,064
- Jason.
- Don't look at me.

1434
01:37:12,066 --> 01:37:13,198
What have they
done to you?

1435
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:14,402
Leave me, Momma.

1436
01:37:15,335 --> 01:37:17,002
No. No!

1437
01:37:20,173 --> 01:37:21,776
Open up this door!

1438
01:37:22,410 --> 01:37:24,045
Please, Jason.

1439
01:37:24,945 --> 01:37:27,581
I love you. Please.

1440
01:37:30,151 --> 01:37:33,955
You're my baby boy.
Open this door.

1441
01:37:34,789 --> 01:37:35,956
Please.

1442
01:37:38,026 --> 01:37:40,126
Jason, please.

1443
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:44,566
Please.

1444
01:37:45,165 --> 01:37:47,768
Please open the door.

1445
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:57,512
Open up!

1446
01:37:59,179 --> 01:38:01,747
Jason!

1447
01:38:01,749 --> 01:38:05,786
I'm all right, Momma.
It's all gonna be all right.

1448
01:38:29,744 --> 01:38:31,411
I don't wanna get your
hopes up, all right,

1449
01:38:31,413 --> 01:38:33,179
but there is a guy,
and I think

1450
01:38:33,181 --> 01:38:36,681
he might be the guy.
I got his DNA.

1451
01:38:36,683 --> 01:38:38,751
Got a lot of it,
actually.

1452
01:38:38,753 --> 01:38:41,121
They're making the checks
as we speak.

1453
01:38:41,123 --> 01:38:42,854
He's in jail?

1454
01:38:42,856 --> 01:38:46,559
No, but he ain't
gonna be hard to find.

1455
01:38:46,561 --> 01:38:48,159
Why do you think
he's the guy?

1456
01:38:48,161 --> 01:38:49,360
I heard him
talking about

1457
01:38:49,362 --> 01:38:52,264
something he did
to a girl last year.

1458
01:38:52,266 --> 01:38:54,102
I couldn't hear
all of it, but...

1459
01:38:55,436 --> 01:38:58,807
It sounded a lot like
what happened to Angela.

1460
01:38:59,906 --> 01:39:02,041
And then he beat
the crap out of me.

1461
01:39:02,043 --> 01:39:03,609
But because of that,

1462
01:39:03,611 --> 01:39:05,614
I got a bunch of his DNA.

1463
01:39:06,347 --> 01:39:07,916
So, I wanted to

1464
01:39:08,782 --> 01:39:11,350
let you know sooner
rather than later.

1465
01:39:11,352 --> 01:39:13,155
I didn't want you
to give up hope.

1466
01:39:14,588 --> 01:39:16,555
I've been trying
not to.

1467
01:39:16,557 --> 01:39:20,359
Well...
All you can do is try.

1468
01:39:20,361 --> 01:39:22,494
As my momma says,

1469
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,633
it's not so much
about hope as about...

1470
01:39:26,468 --> 01:39:27,867
Well, I didn't used to be

1471
01:39:27,869 --> 01:39:29,868
very good at English
at school.

1472
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:31,537
So it was more
"All you can do is try

1473
01:39:31,539 --> 01:39:34,176
"to not be so crap
at English."

1474
01:39:36,878 --> 01:39:40,512
Because you need English,
really, if you wanna be a cop.

1475
01:39:40,514 --> 01:39:43,185
If you wanna be
anything, really.

1476
01:39:49,423 --> 01:39:51,892
Unless you live in Mexico
or something.

1477
01:39:52,893 --> 01:39:54,562
Who wants that?

1478
01:40:15,583 --> 01:40:16,785
Hey, Dixon?

1479
01:40:22,190 --> 01:40:23,225
Thank you.

1480
01:40:57,258 --> 01:40:58,960
You did good, Jason.

1481
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:01,161
You did real good.

1482
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:11,739
But he wasn't the guy.

1483
01:41:19,213 --> 01:41:20,445
What?

1484
01:41:20,447 --> 01:41:22,582
There was no match
to the DNA.

1485
01:41:22,584 --> 01:41:25,417
No matches to any other
crimes of this nature.

1486
01:41:25,419 --> 01:41:28,153
To any crimes at all,
in fact.

1487
01:41:28,155 --> 01:41:29,858
And his record is clean.

1488
01:41:30,790 --> 01:41:32,561
Maybe he was
just bragging.

1489
01:41:33,393 --> 01:41:34,626
He wasn't just bragging.

1490
01:41:34,628 --> 01:41:36,362
Well, that's as may be.

1491
01:41:36,364 --> 01:41:38,663
But at the time
of Angela's death,

1492
01:41:38,665 --> 01:41:40,934
he wasn't even
in the country.

1493
01:41:40,936 --> 01:41:42,333
Where was he?

1494
01:41:42,335 --> 01:41:45,403
I've seen his records of entry
and exit to the States,

1495
01:41:45,405 --> 01:41:48,341
and spoken to his CO.

1496
01:41:48,343 --> 01:41:51,813
He wasn't in the country,
Dixon. He ain't our guy.

1497
01:41:53,013 --> 01:41:54,281
No, he

1498
01:41:56,551 --> 01:41:57,916
might not be our guy,

1499
01:41:57,918 --> 01:41:59,685
but he still done
something shitty.

1500
01:41:59,687 --> 01:42:00,886
I know he did.

1501
01:42:00,888 --> 01:42:02,757
Not in Missouri
he didn't.

1502
01:42:03,391 --> 01:42:04,590
Where was he?

1503
01:42:04,592 --> 01:42:07,193
That's
classified information.

1504
01:42:07,195 --> 01:42:09,060
Oh, come on, man.

1505
01:42:09,062 --> 01:42:11,730
If the guy
has a commanding officer,

1506
01:42:11,732 --> 01:42:13,466
and if the guy
got back to the country

1507
01:42:13,468 --> 01:42:14,667
nine months ago,

1508
01:42:14,669 --> 01:42:17,769
and if the country
where he was is classified,

1509
01:42:17,771 --> 01:42:20,140
which country
do you think he was in?

1510
01:42:21,476 --> 01:42:23,178
Hey, you know...

1511
01:42:25,346 --> 01:42:26,781
I'll give you a clue.

1512
01:42:28,516 --> 01:42:30,118
It was sandy.

1513
01:42:34,054 --> 01:42:36,324
That doesn't really
narrow it down.

1514
01:42:38,593 --> 01:42:40,591
All you need
to know is that

1515
01:42:40,593 --> 01:42:42,661
he didn't do nothing
to Angela Hayes.

1516
01:42:42,663 --> 01:42:45,200
So, we're gonna
keep looking.

1517
01:42:51,239 --> 01:42:52,307
All right?

1518
01:43:03,383 --> 01:43:05,319
I found my badge
after all.

1519
01:44:13,087 --> 01:44:14,155
Hello?

1520
01:44:14,755 --> 01:44:16,057
<i>It's Dixon.</i>

1521
01:44:21,294 --> 01:44:22,730
Tell me.

1522
01:44:25,432 --> 01:44:27,198
He weren't the guy.

1523
01:44:43,017 --> 01:44:44,285
Mildred?

1524
01:44:54,562 --> 01:44:56,030
Are you sure?

1525
01:44:57,632 --> 01:45:01,469
He... He weren't even in
the country when it happened.

1526
01:45:03,070 --> 01:45:08,142
So, whatever he did,
he didn't do it round here.

1527
01:45:09,610 --> 01:45:12,176
<i>I'm sorry I got
your hopes up.</i>

1528
01:45:12,178 --> 01:45:14,248
That's all right.
That's all right.

1529
01:45:17,017 --> 01:45:18,283
At least I had
a day of hoping,

1530
01:45:18,285 --> 01:45:20,822
and that's more
than I've had for a while.

1531
01:45:27,495 --> 01:45:28,797
I gotta go.

1532
01:45:32,566 --> 01:45:34,002
There was, uh...

1533
01:45:35,536 --> 01:45:37,806
There was one thing
I was thinking.

1534
01:45:40,441 --> 01:45:41,810
<i>What's that?</i>

1535
01:45:42,576 --> 01:45:44,445
I know he ain't
your rapist.

1536
01:45:45,780 --> 01:45:49,884
He is a rapist, though.
I'm sure of that.

1537
01:45:58,090 --> 01:45:59,828
What are you
saying to me?

1538
01:46:01,962 --> 01:46:03,598
Got his license plate.

1539
01:46:06,734 --> 01:46:08,468
I know where he lives.

1540
01:46:11,472 --> 01:46:12,907
Where's he live?

1541
01:46:14,807 --> 01:46:16,310
He lives in Idaho.

1542
01:46:22,616 --> 01:46:23,951
That's funny.

1543
01:46:27,087 --> 01:46:29,357
I'm driving to Idaho
in the morning.

1544
01:46:34,928 --> 01:46:36,431
Want some company?

1545
01:46:42,169 --> 01:46:43,237
Sure.

1546
01:49:25,266 --> 01:49:27,502
- Hey, Dixon?
- Yeah?

1547
01:49:28,835 --> 01:49:30,237
I need to tell you
something.

1548
01:49:32,539 --> 01:49:35,343
It was me that burned down
the police station.

1549
01:49:37,611 --> 01:49:40,281
Why, who the hell else
would it have been?

1550
01:49:52,359 --> 01:49:53,628
Dixon?

1551
01:49:54,328 --> 01:49:55,827
Yeah?

1552
01:49:55,829 --> 01:49:57,729
Are you sure
about this?

1553
01:49:57,731 --> 01:49:59,534
About killing this guy?

1554
01:50:02,002 --> 01:50:04,237
Not really. You?

1555
01:50:07,607 --> 01:50:09,209
Not really.

1556
01:50:11,511 --> 01:50:13,781
I guess we can decide
along the way.

2
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:24,974
An article, which I believe appeared
in a newspaper, asked why,

3
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:29,478
since it would seem that you are
in effect the Mayor of Chicago,

4
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:34,192
you're not simply being
appointed to that position.

5
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:41,741
Well, I tell ya, it's touching.
Like a lot of things in life,

6
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:46,287
we laugh because it's funny,
and we laugh because it's true.

7
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:48,456
Some people say,
reformers here say:

8
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:52,627
"Put that man in jail,
what does he think he is doing?"

9
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:56,297
What I hope I'm doing, and here's where
your English paper's got a point is,

10
00:03:56,505 --> 00:03:58,799
I'm responding to
the will of the people.

11
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:06,349
People are gonna drink. We all
know that. All I do is act on that.

12
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:09,352
And all this talk of bootlegging.
What is bootlegging?

13
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,356
On the boat it's bootlegging,
on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.

14
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:15,816
I'm a businessman.

15
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,030
And what of your reputation is that you
control your business through violence?

16
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,868
That those that don't purchase your
product are dealt with violently.

17
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:33,376
It's all right.

18
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:36,754
I grew up in a tough neighbourhood.

19
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:39,799
We used to say, "You can get further
with a kind word and a gun" ...

20
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:43,094
"than you can
with just a kind word."

21
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:46,681
And in that neighbourhood
it might've been true.

22
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,476
And sometimes
your reputation follows you.

23
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:54,647
There is violence in Chicago,
but not by me ...

24
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:59,151
and not by anybody I employ. And I tell
you why, because it's not good business.

25
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:34,645
Leave us alone down here,
we've got everything we need.

26
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:37,857
The green beer you're peddlin'
ain't any good.

27
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:42,278
It's not supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be bought.

28
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:46,199
I'm not buyin' any.

29
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:52,246
Don't worry about it, Pops,
we won't come back.

30
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,294
- How's everyone at your house today?
- They're fine.

31
00:05:58,502 --> 00:06:02,548
- Is your Mama well?
- She has a little cold.

32
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:04,967
Oh, she does?

33
00:06:06,135 --> 00:06:09,347
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- But she'll be all right.

34
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:16,938
- There you go.
- Thank you.

35
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:22,443
That's all right, sweetie.
You be careful crossin' the street.

36
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:25,071
- Mister!
- You tell your Mama that ...

37
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,823
Hey, Mister! Wait!

38
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:31,410
Mister! Wait!
You forgot your brief ...

39
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:41,147
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

40
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:43,733
I know.

41
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:47,195
Now it's time to go to work.

42
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:58,497
You'll make a good first impression.

43
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:09,342
I love you, Eliot.

44
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:16,057
Now, shoo.

45
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:23,481
Eliot Ness, Special Agent
of the Treasury Department.

46
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:26,192
- Mr. Ness.
- Thank you, Chief.

47
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:29,737
At the request of the City of Chicago,
the federal Government, specifically ...

48
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:33,699
the Department of the Treasury
has inaugurated a programme ...

49
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,453
to deal with the flow of illegal
liquor and the violence it creates.

50
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:41,457
Mr. Ness!
Of what does this programme consist?

51
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,544
I and other agents of the Treasury
will be working ...

52
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:46,754
with the Chicago Police ...

53
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:49,173
Isn't it just another
showpiece programme?

54
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:53,553
- What do you think of prohibition?
- Do you drink, Mr. Ness?

55
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:57,640
- Come on, answer the questions.
- It's not just a showpiece.

56
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,060
And I'll tell you
how I feel about prohibition.

57
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,687
It is the law of the land.

58
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:05,690
Do you consider yourself
a crusader, is that it?

59
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:08,192
What qualifications
do you have for the job?

60
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:10,778
Do you have any political ambitions?

61
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:13,698
All right, boys,
I think that's enough.

62
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:19,328
What are your real plans?
What have you got coming up?

63
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:21,622
You'll have to read about it
in the paper.

64
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:25,501
- Let me ride along with you.
- No. Can't help you.

65
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:28,963
Mr. Ness, Lieutenant Alderson,
the Flying Squad.

66
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:32,133
Are you ready to meet the men?

67
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,553
Yes, I am.

68
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:48,357
I have one more thing to say.

69
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:55,489
I know that many of you take a drink.

70
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,577
What you've done before today
is not my concern.

71
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:03,331
But now we must be pure,
and I want you to stop.

72
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:09,128
It's not a question of whether it's
'a harmless drink'. It may well be.

73
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:10,922
But it's against the law.

74
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:15,384
And as we are going to enforce
the law, we must do first by example.

75
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:22,767
Are there any questions?

76
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:27,522
Good. The Department
of the Treasury's had ...

77
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:29,857
a man undercover here
for some time now.

78
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:32,109
We've received word
from this informant ...

79
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,821
that a large shipment of Canadian
whiskey has arrived in Chicago.

80
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:38,741
So I hope that you have signed on
for some action.

81
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:51,462
Remember, the liquor cases
are marked with the red maple leaf.

82
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:54,924
The Treasury Agent is
in a grey suit with a white scarf.

83
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:59,679
- He is not to be arrested.
- A grey suit and a white scarf.

84
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:04,308
- That's it. Are your men ready?
- Yes, sir. They are.

85
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:14,694
- At ease.
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

86
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:23,536
- How are we doin'?
- Okay.

87
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,004
- Want part of a sandwich?
- No, thank you, sir.

88
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,179
- You nervous?
- No, sir.

89
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:47,977
- Been with the unit long?
- A short while.

90
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:53,065
- I suppose we all want to do well.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:01,824
A message from my wife.

92
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:06,287
- You married?
- Yes, sir, I am.

93
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:09,290
Nice to be married, huh?

94
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:28,309
Just follow me.

95
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:13,104
- Oh, God ...
- Federal officer. Hands in the air.

96
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:15,648
Get 'em up. Drop it.

97
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:18,442
Damn it, I can't, it'll break.

98
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:22,029
Mr. Ness. Look, I was just ...

99
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,323
Geez, I'm sorry.

100
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:30,079
Listen, I can do a lot for you,
what you're tryin' to do.

101
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,498
I get the big scoop,
you make a big splash.

102
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:37,169
Get some support. What do you say?
Let's be real, let me help you.

103
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,630
Okay. Just shut up.

104
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:09,035
All right now ...
Let's do some good!

105
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:24,425
Hold it right there!

106
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:31,641
Federal officer. You're under arrest
for violations of the Volstead Act.

107
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:43,569
Let's cover the doors!
Don't let anybody out!

108
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:47,615
Preseuski.

109
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:51,786
- I'm here with permission.
- Who gave you permission?

110
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:54,956
- Mr. Ness!
- Sorry, let him through here.

111
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,709
Let him through here.

112
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:03,005
You want to take your picture,
take it now.

113
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:06,509
- You ready?
- Ready.

114
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,704
Liquor, huh?

115
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:39,125
Get him out of here.

116
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:43,462
- Tear the place apart!
- I mean now, get him out!

117
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,595
That means you, too.

118
00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:57,351
Christ!

119
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,350
Now, what do you think you're doing?

120
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,480
You want to throw garbage? Throw it
in the goddamn trash basket.

121
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:27,900
Don't you have
more important things to do?

122
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,278
Yeah.

123
00:17:30,486 --> 00:17:33,030
But I'm not doing them right now.

124
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:36,951
Do we understand each other?

125
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:43,082
Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?

126
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,337
- Why are you packin' the gun?
- I'm a Treasury Officer.

127
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,426
All right.

128
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:57,346
Just remember
what we talked about now.

129
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,728
Hey ... Wait a minute!

130
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:07,732
What the hell kind of police
do you have in this goddamn city?

131
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,818
You just turned your back
on an armed man.

132
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:14,780
- You're a Treasury officer.
- I just told you I was.

133
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:18,117
Who would claim to be that,
who was not?

134
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:27,084
What's your name and unit?

135
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:33,424
It's right here.

136
00:18:34,842 --> 00:18:38,221
You got a beef?
What is it?

137
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,684
How did you know I had a gun?

138
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:47,647
What do you want,
a free lesson in police work?

139
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,400
No.

140
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,697
Are you okay, pal?

141
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:01,244
I had a rough day on the job.

142
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,957
- Are you going home now?
- I was about to.

143
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:12,922
Well, then, you just fulfilled
the first rule of law enforcement.

144
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:20,930
Make sure when your shift is over
you go home alive.

145
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:24,308
Here endeth the lesson.

146
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,288
$100,000 for 40 barrels.
Make sure there are no empties.

147
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:30,583
I'm gonna give you the ledger,
everything is in the book.

148
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,753
55 gallons to the barrel.

149
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:50,353
- It's Eddie.
- Come in, Eddie.

150
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,132
So, he gets into the snowplough,
and he says, "Let's do some good".

151
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:22,760
And then, we bust through ...

152
00:22:11,726 --> 00:22:15,354
- Mr. Ness?
- Yes?

153
00:22:15,563 --> 00:22:18,900
I came here to thank you.

154
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:20,526
It was ...

155
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:24,530
my little girl that got killed
with that bomb.

156
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:27,867
I'm sorry. Please.

157
00:22:29,535 --> 00:22:32,038
I'm ... I'm so sorry.

158
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:38,044
You see, it's ... because I know
that you have children, too.

159
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:44,383
And that this is real for you,
that these men cause us tragedy.

160
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:48,304
And I know that you will
put a stop to them.

161
00:22:49,388 --> 00:22:51,182
And you do that, now.

162
00:23:48,197 --> 00:23:51,492
- What do you want?
- I'd like to talk to you.

163
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,872
Come in.

164
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,253
I need a small group of men,
handpicked, starting with you.

165
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:06,424
Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.

166
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:12,847
- Now, how can I help you?
- Just work with me.

167
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:16,642
- But why should I, though?
- Because you're a good cop.

168
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:20,730
- How do you know that?
- You told me.

169
00:24:21,522 --> 00:24:23,941
If I'm such a good cop ...

170
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:28,237
How come I'm walkin' the beat,
then, at my age?

171
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:30,364
Do you want to tell me?

172
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:33,451
Well, maybe I'm that
Whore with a Heart of Gold.

173
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:37,413
Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?
Is that what you want to hear?

174
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:39,624
I didn't ask you, and I don't care!

175
00:24:39,832 --> 00:24:43,586
You want to stay on the beat?
You do that.

176
00:24:43,794 --> 00:24:48,132
If you'd like to come with me,
I need your help.

177
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:51,802
I'm askin' you for help.

178
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,769
Well ... that's the thing you fear,
isn't it?

179
00:25:03,481 --> 00:25:08,778
Mr. Ness, I wish I'd met you
ten years and ... twenty pounds ago.

180
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:14,700
But ... I just think it got ...
more important to me ...

181
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,619
to stay alive.

182
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:27,922
And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.
Thank you, no.

183
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,898
That's good, Andy. Let's start up
the thing and take a little ride.

184
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:48,651
I wanna hear
that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!

185
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,196
- Yeah, let me open the door here.
- Yeah, go ahead.

186
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:55,825
Whoopsy daisy,
pick up the door there, Andy.

187
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:59,954
Throw it in the back seat.
Now, let me get the thing started.

188
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:02,206
Yeah, start it up, Andy.

189
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:12,258
Holy mackerel, Andy!
Listen to that Bearcat motor!

190
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:17,180
Yeah, it sounds like the bear
is chasin' that cat all round it!

191
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,892
Andy! She's boilin' over!

192
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:34,864
- Mr. Ness?
- Yes.

193
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:37,491
Oscar Wallace.

194
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:42,413
I've been assigned here
by the Washington Bureau.

195
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:44,874
- Really?
- Yes.

196
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:49,795
Well, I'm glad to have you here,
Mr. Wallace. Would you excuse me?

197
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,716
We are a little in the dark here,
but any ideas you may have ...

198
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,885
Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.

199
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:59,972
And the one I want to try first ...
is this.

200
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,647
He has not filed a return since 1926.

201
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,860
- A return ...?
- An income tax return.

202
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:15,863
- Income tax.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:20,493
- What do you do at the Bureau?
- Oh, I'm an accountant.

204
00:27:21,577 --> 00:27:25,706
- An accountant?
- Yes, and the Bureau sent me here ...

205
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,001
Would you excuse me?

206
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,757
Please.

207
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,785
Okay. Let's go.

208
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:06,914
- Where are we going?
- These walls have ears.

209
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:13,838
You said you wanted to know
how to get Capone.

210
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:20,553
Do you really want to get him?
You see what I'm saying?

211
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:25,349
- What are you prepared to do?
- Everything within the law.

212
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:28,519
And then what are you
prepared to do?

213
00:28:28,728 --> 00:28:31,105
If you open the ball
on these people,

214
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:33,858
you must be prepared
to go all the way.

215
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:37,236
Because they won't give up the fight
until one of you is dead.

216
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:39,530
I want to get Capone.
I don't know how.

217
00:28:39,739 --> 00:28:44,619
Here's how you get Capone:
He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

218
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:47,580
He sends one of yours to hospital,
you send one of his to the morgue!

219
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:51,417
That's the Chicago way!
And that's how you get Capone.

220
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:56,923
Now, do you want to do that?

221
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,842
Are you ready to do that?

222
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:05,473
I'm making you a deal.
Do you want this deal?

223
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:08,935
I have sworn to put this man away,

224
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:14,315
with any and all legal means
at my disposal, and I will do so.

225
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:25,493
Well, the Lord hates a coward.

226
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,878
Do you know what a blood oath is,
Mr. Ness?

227
00:29:36,087 --> 00:29:39,048
- Yes.
- Good. 'Cause you just took one.

228
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:44,303
How do you think Capone knew
about your raid the other night?

229
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:48,140
- Somebody on the cops told him.
- Right. Welcome to Chicago.

230
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:51,811
This town stinks
like a whorehouse at low tide.

231
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:56,524
First, who can you trust?
Nobody. The cops, nobody.

232
00:29:56,732 --> 00:30:01,487
- 'Cause nobody wants you here.
- Then why are you helping me?

233
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:04,699
Because I swore to uphold the law.

234
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:07,743
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another.

235
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:12,206
- Now, who can you trust?
- I can trust nobody.

236
00:30:12,415 --> 00:30:16,502
- That's the sorry truth.
- Then, where are we gonna get help?

237
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:21,549
If you're afraid of getting a rotten
apple, don't go to the barrel.

238
00:30:21,757 --> 00:30:24,093
Get it off the tree.

239
00:30:25,178 --> 00:30:26,679
Get it off the tree ...

240
00:30:28,973 --> 00:30:32,143
Finger out of the trigger guard!
Eject those cartridges!

241
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:35,521
Lay the revolver on the ledge
and stand back!

242
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,148
About face!

243
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:41,110
Barry! I want you to meet
Mr. Eliot Ness.

244
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,114
Treasury Department. How are you?
We need a recruit for extended duty.

245
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:49,952
He is to be seconded to the Treasury
Department. We have the full ...

246
00:30:50,161 --> 00:30:53,414
Barry? Who is consistently
the best shot of this class?

247
00:30:53,623 --> 00:30:58,544
- Williamson and Stone.
- Call them out, one at a time.

248
00:30:58,753 --> 00:31:01,172
- Are either of the men married?
- No.

249
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,966
- Good.
- Williamson!

250
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:08,679
- You're married.
- I don't want any married men.

251
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:13,392
All right, stand easy, son.
I want to ask you something.

252
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:18,022
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect and ...

253
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:20,942
To protect and serve ...
To protect and ...

254
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,321
Please don't search for the yearbook
answer. Just tell me what you think.

255
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,533
- What I think? I ...
- You ...

256
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:31,869
could help ... the force.

257
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:35,873
- You can help ...
- With the force.

258
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:40,711
Thank you.
There goes the next Chief of Police.

259
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:48,803
At ease!

260
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:52,306
Stone! Out here.

261
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:56,602
This kid's a prodigy.

262
00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:02,859
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect the property and ...

263
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:06,028
Oh, please, don't waste my time
with that bullshit.

264
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,283
Where are you from, Stone?

265
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:14,871
- From the Southside.
- Stone?

266
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:18,082
George Stone, that's your name?

267
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:23,921
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.

268
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,465
Nah! What was it
before you changed it?

269
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:33,181
- Giuseppe Petri.
- Geez, I knew it!

270
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:36,309
That's all you need,
one thieving wop on the team!

271
00:32:37,476 --> 00:32:39,145
What's that you said?

272
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:43,149
I said that you're a lyin' member
of a no-good race.

273
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:49,197
That's much better than you,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

274
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,201
Oh, I like him.

275
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,414
Yeah, I like him, too.

276
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:01,918
You just joined
the Treasury Department, son.

277
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:05,421
Yeah, okay.

278
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,883
Eliot Ness.

279
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:13,012
With reports from stake-outs
on the North and West side, and ...

280
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:15,973
Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.

281
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:25,316
What do you think?

282
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:28,778
I think there's nothing
like vaudeville.

283
00:33:28,986 --> 00:33:33,824
- That's what I think.
- Now, are you ready to go to work?

284
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:37,578
- Where are we going?
- On a liquor raid.

285
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:39,580
We need another man.

286
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,999
Mr. Ness? This is very interesting.

287
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:46,295
I've found a financial disbursement
pattern which shows some irregu ...

288
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:48,464
- You carry a badge?
- Yes.

289
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:50,716
Carry a gun.

290
00:34:07,275 --> 00:34:09,694
- Jimmy ...?
- What?

291
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:14,532
What the hell are you dressed for?
Halloween?

292
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,617
Shut up. I'm working.

293
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:18,369
Where? The circus?

294
00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:42,685
- Well, here we are.
- What are we doing here?

295
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,979
Liquor raid.

296
00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:48,149
Here?!

297
00:34:48,357 --> 00:34:52,653
Everybody knows where the booze is.
The problem isn't finding it.

298
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:57,825
The problem is who wants
to cross Capone. Let's go.

299
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:07,877
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.

300
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:17,762
If you walk through this door,
you're walking into a world of trouble.

301
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,932
There's no turning back.
Do you understand?

302
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,600
Yes, I do.

303
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,937
Good. Give me that axe.

304
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:37,615
- Federal officers!
- Get your hands in the air!

305
00:35:37,823 --> 00:35:40,117
- Nobody moves!
- This is a raid!

306
00:35:41,202 --> 00:35:43,329
- Everybody ...
- What are you doin' here?

307
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:47,291
All this stuff is impounded!
You're all under arrest!

308
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,295
Hey! This isn't right!
Hey! This is no good!

309
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:55,132
- You got a warrant?
- Sure! Here's my warrant.

310
00:35:56,759 --> 00:35:59,804
How do you think he feels now?
Better ... or worse?

311
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:10,982
- What is that?
- What is that?

312
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,360
- Yes, what is it?
- God, I'm with a heathen.

313
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:19,574
That is my callbox key.
And that is Saint Jude.

314
00:36:19,782 --> 00:36:24,245
Il Santo Jude.
He's the patron saint of lost causes.

315
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:27,123
And policemen.

316
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:31,878
- Patron saint of policemen?
- Everybody needs a friend.

317
00:36:32,962 --> 00:36:36,257
Lost causes, policemen ...

318
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:40,052
- Which do you want to be?
- I want to be a cop.

319
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:42,096
- You do?
- Yes.

320
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:44,515
Why?

321
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:49,353
'To protect the property
and the citizenry ... '

322
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:53,900
Whoa, it's all right.

323
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:56,611
- What?!
- I got to tell you, congratulations!

324
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:00,615
It's okay if I get a picture
of you and your men?

325
00:37:00,823 --> 00:37:03,701
Yeah. But not for publication.
Just for us!

326
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,537
Anything you say, Mr. Ness.

327
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:10,791
Closer in ... Oh, that's great.
Okay, ready? Hold it.

328
00:37:18,508 --> 00:37:21,093
Life goes on.

329
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:29,310
A man becomes pre-eminent,
he's expected to have enthusiasms.

330
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,562
Enthusiasms ...

331
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,441
Enthusiasms ...

332
00:37:36,817 --> 00:37:38,778
What are mine?

333
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:43,783
What draws my admiration?
What is that which gives me joy?

334
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:47,245
- Dames!
- Boozin'!

335
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:52,208
Baseball!

336
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:00,758
A man ...

337
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:04,303
A man stands alone at the plate.

338
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:08,933
This is the time for what?

339
00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:12,645
For individual achievement.

340
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:16,357
There he stands alone.

341
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:19,735
But in the field, what?

342
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,197
Part of a team.

343
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:26,659
Teamwork ...

344
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:35,084
Looks, throws, catches, hustles.
Part of one big team.

345
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:41,507
Bats himself the live-long day,
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.

346
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:47,305
If his team don't field ... what is he?

347
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,392
You follow me?

348
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:54,270
No one.

349
00:38:54,478 --> 00:38:59,609
Sunny day, the stands are full
of fans. What does he have to say?

350
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:05,239
I'm goin' out there for myself.

351
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:11,954
But ... I get nowhere
unless the team wins.

352
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:14,457
- Team!
- Team.

353
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:23,257
Jesus Christ!

354
00:39:46,697 --> 00:39:49,325
'Now I lay me down to sleep'

355
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:52,912
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'

356
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,915
'If I should die before I wake'

357
00:39:56,123 --> 00:39:59,502
'I pray the Lord my soul to take'

358
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,629
- Amen.
- God bless ...

359
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,800
God bless Mommy, God bless Annie,
God bless Daddy. Amen.

360
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:08,010
Amen.

361
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:18,813
Good night.

362
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:21,065
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, little girl.

363
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:25,111
Want to rub Eskimo?
Butterfly?

364
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,874
- Where are you going?
- What?

365
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:41,836
Where are you going?

366
00:40:42,044 --> 00:40:44,881
I thought I'd go downstairs,
some work to do for tomorrow.

367
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:49,343
- You had a full day today, though?
- Yes, I certainly did.

368
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:51,679
And you've still got
some energy left?

369
00:40:51,888 --> 00:40:53,598
Oh, a lot of work.

370
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:59,437
Well, why don't you come up
and brush my hair? You 'Detective'.

371
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:17,038
- How are we doin'?
- Capone's organisation is diverse.

372
00:41:17,246 --> 00:41:21,667
It owns Canadian Holding Company
Associations, which owns in turn ...

373
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:25,796
Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs,
Jolly Time Playthings ...

374
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,633
- Jolly Time Playthings?
- Yes.

375
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,427
Remind me to get a present
for my daughter.

376
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:35,264
Bahama Ship-to-Shore,
Miss Lucy Togs ... the list is endless!

377
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:39,185
And all the business is legitimate,
and none is owned by Al Capone.

378
00:41:39,393 --> 00:41:42,396
But we can get him on
income tax evasion if we can show ...

379
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:46,734
that any of the 'organisation'
business money is going to him.

380
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:51,155
- Legally, he receives no income.
- He doesn't receive anything?

381
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:54,909
- Mr. Ness? You have a visitor.
- Mister Ness!

382
00:41:55,117 --> 00:41:58,204
Could we talk for a minute?
I'm John O'Shea, Alderman ...

383
00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:00,289
Yes, I know who you are.

384
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:05,920
Would you excuse us?

385
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:11,843
We are busy with several large
operations. What can I do for you?

386
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:15,263
I came up to congratulate you
on a job well done.

387
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:21,227
Share your good fortune
on such a lovely day.

388
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:26,649
What's that?

389
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:34,615
- What is that?
- Mr. Ness, you're an educated man.

390
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:38,286
Let me pay you the compliment
of being blunt.

391
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:44,292
There is a large and popular business
which you are causing dismay.

392
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:50,131
Why don't you just cross the street
and let things take their course?

393
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:53,342
Would you come in here, please?

394
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,518
In Roman times, when a fellow tried
to bribe a public official,

395
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:04,937
they would cut off his nose,
sew him in a bag ...

396
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:08,774
with a wild animal,
and throw that bag in the river.

397
00:43:08,983 --> 00:43:13,362
You tell your master
that we must agree to ... disagree!

398
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:18,034
- You're making a mistake.
- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.

399
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:22,830
You fellows are 'untouchable',
is that it? No one can get to you?

400
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,417
You tell Capone ...
that I'll see him in hell.

401
00:43:29,629 --> 00:43:31,631
Hey! Nice house!

402
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,675
I said, nice house!
Do you live there?

403
00:43:36,344 --> 00:43:39,972
Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?

404
00:43:40,181 --> 00:43:42,141
Yes.

405
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,602
Nice to have a family.

406
00:43:47,313 --> 00:43:50,024
Yes, it is.

407
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:54,737
A man should take care,
see that nothin' happens to them.

408
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,671
Catherine?!

409
00:44:13,172 --> 00:44:15,049
Catherine!

410
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:17,718
- Where's the baby?
- She's upstairs. Eliot!

411
00:44:30,565 --> 00:44:34,277
- What were you doing up?
- I had to finish my ironing.

412
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:39,532
You did? You're gonna come
with Daddy now, okay?

413
00:44:51,294 --> 00:44:53,713
Eliot? Okay, it's all right!

414
00:44:53,921 --> 00:44:56,215
Okay, let's go.

415
00:44:56,424 --> 00:45:00,219
Stay there!
Keep your eye on the street!

416
00:45:01,971 --> 00:45:05,516
- Where's Malone?
- On the stake-out. He'll be here.

417
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:09,103
- Who's this guy?
- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.

418
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:15,109
Drive to the station. She'll let you
know where to go when you get there.

419
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:17,570
Take off your hat.

420
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:21,115
Anything happens, shoot first.
You understand me?

421
00:45:21,324 --> 00:45:23,534
Yes, Mr. Ness.

422
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:28,497
Kiss.

423
00:45:28,706 --> 00:45:31,834
- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.
- Okay.

424
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:37,423
Now, go!

425
00:45:59,487 --> 00:46:01,155
Malone!

426
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,699
- Are they okay?
- Yeah.

427
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:07,286
- You sure the cop's okay?
- He'd better be, he's my cousin.

428
00:46:07,495 --> 00:46:10,706
I want to hurt the man, Malone!
You hear me?!

429
00:46:10,915 --> 00:46:13,876
I want to take the battle to him.
I want to hurt Capone.

430
00:46:14,085 --> 00:46:17,588
Well, then, a Merry Christmas,
we've got some great news.

431
00:46:17,797 --> 00:46:20,258
A huge international
shipment's coming.

432
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:25,054
We've got the time, the place
and the whole shebang.

433
00:46:25,263 --> 00:46:28,349
Well, what are we doin'
standin' here, then?

434
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:31,435
How do you come by this information?

435
00:46:31,644 --> 00:46:33,771
That's the second rule
of police work:

436
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,732
If you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.

437
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:45,283
You know he's making
over $3 million a year?

438
00:46:45,491 --> 00:46:48,077
But he's paid no taxes,
nothing's in his name.

439
00:46:48,286 --> 00:46:50,538
If we can establish
any payments to him,

440
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:53,791
we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion.

441
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,334
What?

442
00:46:55,543 --> 00:46:59,881
I said, we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion!

443
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:03,426
Try a murderer
for not paying his taxes?!

444
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:06,679
Well, it's better than nothing.

445
00:47:06,888 --> 00:47:10,892
All right. How do we
link him to the money?

446
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:14,020
I don't know.

447
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:18,149
Go to sleep, Oscar.

448
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:08,074
A convoy of 5-10 trucks
with good Canadian whiskey ...

449
00:48:08,282 --> 00:48:11,953
will be met by a high-level member
of the Capone organisation.

450
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:15,748
He will be bringing full payment
for the shipment in cash.

451
00:48:15,957 --> 00:48:21,838
Now, the meet is to take place just
over the border on the American side.

452
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:25,258
We want to confiscate
the liquor and the cash.

453
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:29,387
- Captain?
- We will await their signal.

454
00:48:29,595 --> 00:48:32,723
When they're on the road
and have given the signal,

455
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:36,727
we will engage from
the Canadian side of the bridge.

456
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:38,938
Thus taking them
by surprise from the rear.

457
00:48:39,146 --> 00:48:43,818
And surprise, as you very well know,
Mr. Ness, is half the battle.

458
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:47,238
Surprise is half the battle.
Many things are half the battle.

459
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:51,784
Losing is half the battle.
Let's think about what is all the battle.

460
00:48:51,993 --> 00:48:54,495
Let's take the fight
to them, gentlemen!

461
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:56,914
Thank you, Captain.

462
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:01,794
All right! Move out!

463
00:49:19,187 --> 00:49:21,939
Take it easy.

464
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:26,527
Take it easy!
It'll all happen in time.

465
00:49:27,862 --> 00:49:30,239
This is the job.

466
00:49:30,448 --> 00:49:34,118
Don't wait for it to happen,
don't even want it to happen.

467
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:36,954
Just watch what does happen.

468
00:49:38,164 --> 00:49:40,208
Are you my 'tutor'?

469
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:44,253
Yes, sir, that I am.

470
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:49,926
- Did you check it already?
- Yes, I did.

471
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:52,220
Then leave it alone.

472
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:55,473
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.

473
00:49:55,681 --> 00:49:59,310
You're doing good.
You're gonna do just fine.

474
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:05,816
- Wallace, are you cold?
- Yes, I am, a little.

475
00:50:06,025 --> 00:50:09,111
Then stamp your feet.
It'll keep you warm.

476
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,406
You learn something,
20 years walking the beat.

477
00:50:12,615 --> 00:50:16,953
Stitches and standing in the rain ...

478
00:50:46,148 --> 00:50:48,359
Listen, Mr. Ness ...

479
00:50:50,236 --> 00:50:51,863
I had an idea.

480
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:50,421
You all have your spare shells?

481
00:52:04,852 --> 00:52:09,440
If you have to fire,
hold low and squeeze.

482
00:52:09,649 --> 00:52:12,568
And put your man down.

483
00:52:15,071 --> 00:52:17,740
Because he'll do the same to you.

484
00:52:17,949 --> 00:52:20,201
Shoot to kill.

485
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:24,747
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.

486
00:52:26,332 --> 00:52:28,793
Let's go.

487
00:52:52,275 --> 00:52:53,651
Easy ...

488
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,488
The Canadians will not show
until I flash the badge.

489
00:52:57,738 --> 00:53:01,284
So we must cover the ground
to the bridge as quickly as possible.

490
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:03,202
George, the count's right.

491
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:06,706
I'm concerned about
the size of these barrels!

492
00:53:06,914 --> 00:53:09,584
Malone, you and I will
take the men ...

493
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:12,712
Move it! Move it, Georgie!

494
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,424
Get over here!
Leave the stuff in the cars!

495
00:53:17,383 --> 00:53:18,718
Charge!

496
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:22,847
What the hell!
You got to die of somethin'.

497
00:53:26,142 --> 00:53:30,104
- Look! Here they come!
- Mounties! Let's get out of here!

498
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:32,273
Move, move!

499
00:53:41,782 --> 00:53:44,118
Let's go!

500
00:53:48,498 --> 00:53:49,790
I can't believe it!

501
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:53,044
- Here are the codes.
- Give me that.

502
00:53:53,252 --> 00:53:55,046
Don't let those cars off the bridge!

503
00:54:13,898 --> 00:54:15,775
Stone, take the first car!

504
00:54:17,485 --> 00:54:19,946
Get this shit out of the way!

505
00:54:39,632 --> 00:54:40,967
Tough guy!

506
00:54:44,345 --> 00:54:45,930
Stone!

507
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,515
Go!

508
00:54:49,308 --> 00:54:51,185
Stone!

509
00:54:52,311 --> 00:54:53,604
I'm okay.

510
00:54:55,189 --> 00:54:57,191
You thugs!

511
00:55:11,414 --> 00:55:13,624
You all right?

512
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,711
Yeah. There he is! Go get him!

513
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:33,436
All right!
Enough of this running shit!

514
00:55:33,686 --> 00:55:37,356
Well, Georgie-boy!
Well, what have we got here?

515
00:55:38,524 --> 00:55:40,568
Hello.

516
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:04,193
All right! Drop the gun!

517
00:57:04,402 --> 00:57:06,863
Put your hands in the air,
you're under arrest.

518
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:09,991
I said, drop it!

519
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:13,452
Stop!

520
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:21,711
God, didn't ya hear what I said?!

521
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,046
What are you, deaf?!

522
00:57:25,339 --> 00:57:27,341
What is this, a game?!

523
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:55,369
Here. Sit down.

524
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,839
Stone's gonna be all right.

525
00:58:07,089 --> 00:58:10,009
I got the fellow with the satchel.

526
00:58:16,682 --> 00:58:19,018
- I had to kill him.
- Oh, yeah.

527
00:58:19,268 --> 00:58:22,104
He's as dead as Julius Caesar.

528
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:27,068
- Would you rather it was you?
- No, I would not.

529
00:58:27,318 --> 00:58:31,864
Well, then you've done your duty.
Go home and sleep well tonight.

530
00:58:32,114 --> 00:58:35,368
The things you see
when you're out without your gun.

531
00:58:35,576 --> 00:58:39,205
Now you're a long way
from the Southside, George.

532
00:58:39,455 --> 00:58:43,084
I'm talkin' to you. Did you come
here to open a shooting gallery?

533
00:58:43,334 --> 00:58:46,671
I want you to write down the names
of your superiors and contacts.

534
00:58:46,921 --> 00:58:49,924
Why don't you kiss my ass?

535
00:58:50,132 --> 00:58:52,301
- Perhaps you didn't hear me.
- Eliot?

536
00:58:52,552 --> 00:58:54,595
- You've broken the law ...
- Eliot!

537
00:58:54,846 --> 00:58:56,848
You can be tough in Leavenworth
for 30 years.

538
00:58:57,098 --> 00:59:00,101
- You're going inside for all day!
- Is that what you want?

539
00:59:00,351 --> 00:59:03,104
- Eliot!
- What?!

540
00:59:03,312 --> 00:59:05,648
Look at this!

541
00:59:05,898 --> 00:59:08,734
- Look at this!
- What is this?

542
00:59:10,945 --> 00:59:12,738
What is this?

543
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:17,285
You got a lot of money changing
hands in this book.

544
00:59:17,535 --> 00:59:21,747
What is this, 'war'?
And 'police precincts'?

545
00:59:23,457 --> 00:59:26,794
And you got a heading here ...
'Circuit Court'.

546
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:30,631
You got a heading here,
'Circuit Court'. What is this?

547
00:59:30,882 --> 00:59:33,801
Nothin'. There's nothin'
you can make out of it.

548
00:59:34,051 --> 00:59:37,388
If any of these coded entries
indicate payment to Capone,

549
00:59:37,597 --> 00:59:39,390
then we can put Capone away.

550
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,269
- Which entry is Al Capone?
- A. Costa, is that his code name?

551
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,272
You'll do the whole thing
in the joint unless you help us.

552
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,900
Translate this ledger for us!

553
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,693
- In hell.
- In hell?!

554
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:55,615
You will hang high
unless you cooperate.

555
00:59:55,865 --> 00:59:59,452
This man can finger Al Capone,
put him behind bars.

556
00:59:59,702 --> 01:00:01,412
Why don't you guys just fuck off?!

557
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:08,085
I'm not fuckin' with you! We'll have
that information one way or another.

558
01:00:08,294 --> 01:00:10,213
- Not that way. Out.
- You're gonna talk!

559
01:00:10,463 --> 01:00:13,216
You're gonna be beggin' to talk!

560
01:00:13,466 --> 01:00:16,552
- You dirty son-of-a-bitch!
- Enough out of you.

561
01:00:20,348 --> 01:00:22,642
Hey, come on, you, on your feet!

562
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:26,187
I need you to help me
to translate this book!

563
01:00:26,395 --> 01:00:28,397
I'm not gonna ask you a second time.

564
01:00:28,606 --> 01:00:30,775
I'm gonna count to three.

565
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:36,239
What's the matter? Can't you talk
with a gun in your mouth?

566
01:00:38,324 --> 01:00:39,659
One.

567
01:00:43,913 --> 01:00:45,790
Two!

568
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,252
Three.

569
01:00:50,336 --> 01:00:51,796
I'm gonna talk!

570
01:00:52,004 --> 01:00:56,592
Don't! I'm gonna tell ya whatever
ya want. What do ya want to know?

571
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,474
Now, don't let him clean himself
until after he talks.

572
01:01:03,683 --> 01:01:06,727
Now, ask him what you want to know.

573
01:01:06,978 --> 01:01:11,107
All right ... Okay, I want to know
the name of the bookkeeper.

574
01:01:11,357 --> 01:01:15,486
I want a complete translation
of the code. I want a complete ...

575
01:01:15,695 --> 01:01:18,155
Mister Ness!

576
01:01:24,287 --> 01:01:26,581
I do not approve of your methods!

577
01:01:27,748 --> 01:01:32,461
Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.

578
01:01:36,632 --> 01:01:38,926
- What?
- They got the shipment.

579
01:01:39,135 --> 01:01:41,679
- What?!
- They got the whole shipment.

580
01:01:41,888 --> 01:01:45,850
- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead!
- We're trying to locate ...

581
01:01:46,058 --> 01:01:51,981
What am I, alone in this world? Did I
ask you what you're tryin' to do?

582
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:56,777
I want you to get this fuck where he
breathes! I want Eliot Ness dead!

583
01:01:56,986 --> 01:02:00,198
I want his family dead,
his house burnt to the ground!

584
01:02:00,406 --> 01:02:02,700
I want to piss on his ashes!

585
01:02:02,909 --> 01:02:08,164
Look at this guy, this guy,
he's so serious.

586
01:02:08,372 --> 01:02:11,626
- Well, he's got a lot on his mind.
- He does?

587
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:13,794
- Yes.
- Like what?

588
01:02:15,338 --> 01:02:17,006
Like what his name is.

589
01:02:17,215 --> 01:02:21,385
John, I thought that was all settled.
I thought we liked John.

590
01:02:21,594 --> 01:02:24,096
I suppose his middle name
will be Law.

591
01:02:24,847 --> 01:02:28,184
No ... it'll be Edgar.

592
01:02:29,685 --> 01:02:33,272
- It'll be J. Edgar ...
- I don't think so.

593
01:02:36,859 --> 01:02:39,237
God, you're beautiful.

594
01:02:41,072 --> 01:02:43,324
You should have seen us last night.

595
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:48,538
I know. I should have been here.
I wanted to be here.

596
01:02:48,788 --> 01:02:52,041
I know. I understand, I do.

597
01:02:53,584 --> 01:02:56,462
Just tell me, are you being careful?

598
01:02:56,671 --> 01:03:00,174
- Careful as mice.
- Are you making progress?

599
01:03:00,383 --> 01:03:02,510
- Progress?
- Yes?

600
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,931
Mrs. Ness, I think your husband
just became the man who got Al Capone.

601
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:20,069
Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued
for Alphonse Capone ...

602
01:03:20,278 --> 01:03:25,199
by my office this morning,
for the crime of evading ...

603
01:03:25,408 --> 01:03:28,953
and conspiring to evade
Federal Income Tax.

604
01:03:29,162 --> 01:03:32,290
- What's the maximum he could get?
- If convicted on all counts,

605
01:03:32,498 --> 01:03:36,586
Mr. Capone could have
up to 28 years.

606
01:03:36,794 --> 01:03:39,964
Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.

607
01:03:46,512 --> 01:03:50,808
The car's in the yard. When ya get
him there, don't answer the phone.

608
01:03:51,017 --> 01:03:53,144
- We'll call, let it ring ...
- Twice.

609
01:03:53,352 --> 01:03:55,271
- We'll call ...
- From the corner.

610
01:03:55,479 --> 01:03:59,066
- Anybody knocks on the door ...
- Come out shooting. I got it.

611
01:03:59,275 --> 01:04:02,278
You enjoy the tactical aspects
of law enforcement, Oscar?

612
01:04:02,486 --> 01:04:05,281
Much more diverting
than accounting.

613
01:04:05,489 --> 01:04:07,658
I'm bein' good to you,
you got to be good to me.

614
01:04:07,867 --> 01:04:11,329
We made a deal,
we're gonna stick to it, okay?

615
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:19,754
Oh, yes, much more diverting
than accounting.

616
01:04:20,004 --> 01:04:22,215
Okay, we see yous tonight.

617
01:04:22,465 --> 01:04:26,177
All right, all the way down
and no stops.

618
01:04:34,268 --> 01:04:37,939
he's been saying,
"I will speak up."

619
01:04:39,774 --> 01:04:43,903
For which I must commend
the excellent work ...

620
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:47,782
of Eliot Ness
and his squad of Untouchables.

621
01:04:50,368 --> 01:04:52,745
- What was it, a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

622
01:04:52,954 --> 01:04:55,915
- Congratulations! What's his name?
- John.

623
01:04:56,123 --> 01:04:59,085
- John?
- Yeah. John James.

624
01:05:00,294 --> 01:05:02,672
- So she's okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

625
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,342
In fact, when she gets out,
she wants to repaint the house.

626
01:05:06,551 --> 01:05:10,888
Then she'll find the house too small,
you'll have to move.

627
01:05:11,097 --> 01:05:16,394
- Goodness, it's nice to be married.
- If you can stand the pain.

628
01:05:16,602 --> 01:05:18,187
Mr. Burns, where's Mr. Wallace?

629
01:05:18,396 --> 01:05:23,901
Didn't you see him? He just went
down in the service elevator.

630
01:05:24,902 --> 01:05:28,948
- You keep an eye out at all times ...
- Take it easy, we'll be fine.

631
01:05:29,156 --> 01:05:31,617
They are going to ...

632
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:43,004
- Did he say the service elevator?
- Yes.

633
01:05:49,135 --> 01:05:52,513
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Here, let's take the stairs.

634
01:06:32,553 --> 01:06:34,889
Oh, no.

635
01:06:35,973 --> 01:06:39,060
- No, no!
- Easy ... Easy!

636
01:06:41,604 --> 01:06:43,105
Oscar.

637
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:24,355
Oh, Jesus.

638
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:30,862
You gonna be all right?

639
01:07:51,007 --> 01:07:56,179
It's always a crime when a young guy
goes down in the line, Jimmy.

640
01:07:57,263 --> 01:08:00,391
I'd hate to see it happen
to someone I know.

641
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,228
Sometimes it's better
not to get involved.

642
01:08:04,437 --> 01:08:06,564
Jimmy!

643
01:08:06,772 --> 01:08:10,443
Take a day off.
Get out of the city for a while.

644
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:12,695
You know what I mean?

645
01:08:29,795 --> 01:08:31,714
- Al Capone.
- We have no Mr. Capone ...

646
01:08:31,923 --> 01:08:35,426
- I know, get him.
- We have no Mr. Capone ...

647
01:08:35,885 --> 01:08:37,512
I said ...

648
01:08:44,143 --> 01:08:47,438
- Something you want here?
- My friend was killed today.

649
01:08:47,647 --> 01:08:50,399
- I don't care.
- You don't care.

650
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:55,613
Now he does.

651
01:08:55,821 --> 01:09:00,159
Come on here, Capone. You want
to fight? You and me, right here?

652
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:01,702
That's it, come on!

653
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:05,498
You afraid to come out from behind
your men, to stand up for yourself?

654
01:09:05,748 --> 01:09:09,710
- You want to do the mat now?
- Yeah! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

655
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:11,796
- What?
- Easy.

656
01:09:12,046 --> 01:09:15,550
You talk to me like that in front
of my son? Fuck you and your family!

657
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:21,514
Easy. It's me. It's me!

658
01:09:21,764 --> 01:09:23,474
Not this way.

659
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:26,352
You fuck, you got nothin'!
You're nothin' but talk and a badge.

660
01:09:26,561 --> 01:09:32,275
You're here because you got nothin'
in court, no bookkeeper, nothin'!

661
01:09:32,483 --> 01:09:36,863
If you were a man, you would've done
it now! You got nothin', you punk!

662
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:49,333
Well, no, I understand.

663
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:52,420
Believe me, I understand.

664
01:09:59,844 --> 01:10:02,221
Well, what's happened?

665
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:08,311
He says he can't be unprotected.

666
01:10:10,062 --> 01:10:12,732
What is it that the guy says?

667
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,568
He says he won't make
a fool out of himself,

668
01:10:15,776 --> 01:10:19,113
and he won't go into court
without a witness.

669
01:10:19,322 --> 01:10:23,576
So tomorrow morning the D.A. Will
announce that he's dropping the case.

670
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:27,663
- He's gonna give up.
- He won't do it without a witness.

671
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:30,541
We have Wallace's files
and the ledgers.

672
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:34,420
There's a time when I think
you have to cut your losses.

673
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:37,548
Hello?

674
01:10:39,592 --> 01:10:41,636
Hello.

675
01:10:43,262 --> 01:10:45,264
Yes.

676
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:51,521
No, he didn't have a family.

677
01:10:53,981 --> 01:10:56,692
How is everything there?

678
01:10:59,946 --> 01:11:03,449
No, you do it however you want.

679
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:07,745
I promise I will.

680
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:11,165
You give her my love.

681
01:11:11,374 --> 01:11:13,417
I love you, too.

682
01:11:15,545 --> 01:11:20,716
Mr. Ness, we got a ledger here listing
payments to Chicago City officials.

683
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:24,887
- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti ...
- I think that's enough for today.

684
01:11:25,096 --> 01:11:29,141
- If we don't stay on top ...
- That'll do. Thank you.

685
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:33,271
I'd like to request to stick around.

686
01:11:34,438 --> 01:11:37,024
- We got to bust these guys.
- I know we got to.

687
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:47,994
Is that it?

688
01:11:49,078 --> 01:11:51,706
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

689
01:11:51,914 --> 01:11:54,375
My question is, are we done?

690
01:11:56,377 --> 01:11:58,754
Yes, I think we're done.

691
01:11:58,963 --> 01:12:01,841
So we sat in at a game
that was above our head?

692
01:12:02,049 --> 01:12:04,427
It appears so.
It appears so to Mr. Wallace.

693
01:12:04,635 --> 01:12:06,929
He's dead! And the D.A.
Is gonna drop the case!

694
01:12:07,138 --> 01:12:09,432
He will not go into court
without a witness ...

695
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,602
and without Capone's bookkeeper,
Walter Payne.

696
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:17,648
- What are you prepared to do now?
- What would you have me do?

697
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:20,651
I have taken this
as far as it can go.

698
01:12:34,665 --> 01:12:38,753
- What did your wife want?
- She wanted to know if I was ...

699
01:12:39,837 --> 01:12:42,632
- My wife?
- Yeah.

700
01:12:46,594 --> 01:12:49,472
She wanted to know
if I was all right.

701
01:12:51,807 --> 01:12:54,143
It's nice being married, eh?

702
01:12:55,394 --> 01:12:56,729
Yes.

703
01:12:56,938 --> 01:13:00,233
She's sitting in some room surrounded
by people she doesn't know,

704
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:04,737
going over ...
kitchen colour charts or something.

705
01:13:11,369 --> 01:13:17,083
Some part of the world still cares
what colour the kitchen is.

706
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:25,925
Eliot, I want you to do
one more thing for me.

707
01:13:28,344 --> 01:13:31,889
Get back to the D.A. And stall him.

708
01:13:32,598 --> 01:13:36,769
- Wait a minute, stall him with what?
- Just do as I say.

709
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:42,608
I think I know how to find this guy.

710
01:13:44,694 --> 01:13:47,446
Walter?

711
01:13:47,655 --> 01:13:52,660
Al says we got to get out of town
until he can fix this subpoena thing.

712
01:13:52,869 --> 01:13:55,830
We're leavin' tonight.

713
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:01,169
Two ball, down.

714
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:08,259
Mike, you got a minute?

715
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:11,137
I do now, don't I?

716
01:14:12,263 --> 01:14:15,558
And what are you doin'
in a club for cops, Jimmy?

717
01:14:16,517 --> 01:14:19,061
This is a place for cops.

718
01:14:19,312 --> 01:14:21,856
Can we step outside?

719
01:14:22,106 --> 01:14:26,444
All right, all right,
but I got nothin' to say to ya.

720
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:36,204
Where the hell are we going, for a
swim? Get out of the rain, you fool.

721
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:41,292
What? What?!

722
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:44,587
I just need one more
piece of information.

723
01:14:44,795 --> 01:14:46,756
One more? Jimmy!

724
01:14:46,964 --> 01:14:52,011
- I just risked my life for ya.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

725
01:14:53,137 --> 01:14:59,101
Are you crazy? You're crazy.
I warned you to get out of town.

726
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:03,314
- If they knew it was me, I'm dead.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

727
01:15:03,523 --> 01:15:08,110
You're fuckin' nuts, man!
You're out of your fuckin' mind!

728
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:10,571
And I tried to save your life.

729
01:15:11,447 --> 01:15:16,035
Get your hands off. You owe me,
Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'.

730
01:15:16,244 --> 01:15:19,413
- My people are being killed.
- We're your people!

731
01:15:19,622 --> 01:15:24,627
You?! You fuckin' run with the dagos!
They've ruined this town.

732
01:15:24,836 --> 01:15:29,048
For ten years I can't say that I'm
a cop for the shit that's goin' on!

733
01:15:29,298 --> 01:15:34,804
Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit!
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

734
01:15:36,722 --> 01:15:42,311
Go on and live the charade, with your
soft clothes and federal stooges.

735
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,524
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Keep your mouth off that!

736
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:50,862
I need to know where this guy is,
and I need to know now!

737
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:55,116
I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit
that I know that you've done!

738
01:15:55,324 --> 01:15:57,869
I'm gonna turn you over!

739
01:15:58,077 --> 01:16:01,622
- This is a dead man talkin' to me.
- Is it?

740
01:16:03,791 --> 01:16:05,626
You're dead.

741
01:16:28,191 --> 01:16:29,901
Who the hell do ya think ya are?

742
01:16:30,109 --> 01:16:32,945
I'll have your ass hangin'
from the flagpole in the mornin'.

743
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:44,582
Let's cut the woofing, pal.
You tell me,

744
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:47,835
or you're going to hospital
or the fuckin' morgue!

745
01:16:48,044 --> 01:16:50,546
You're gonna fight it out
and we'll have a case.

746
01:16:50,755 --> 01:16:54,342
Yes? On what basis?
I'm not gonna make a fool ...

747
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:57,178
Don't tell me about
makin' a fool out of yourself.

748
01:16:57,386 --> 01:16:59,972
I have men out there
risking more than that.

749
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:02,683
We have a lead,
and we are following that lead ...

750
01:17:02,934 --> 01:17:07,855
at risk to more than our standing.
So don't you dare stop now.

751
01:17:09,941 --> 01:17:11,984
- Yeah, Stone.
- Give me Ness.

752
01:17:12,235 --> 01:17:13,778
He's at the D.A. 's.

753
01:17:14,028 --> 01:17:16,948
Tell him I know where Payne is
and to meet me at my place.

754
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:37,969
- Al! Al!
- Mr. Capone!

755
01:17:38,177 --> 01:17:42,598
- What about that court case?
- I'm gonna tell ya somethin'.

756
01:17:42,807 --> 01:17:46,936
Somebody messes with me,
I'm gonna mess with him.

757
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:51,190
Somebody steals from me,
I'm gonna say 'you stole',

758
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:54,652
not talk to him
for spittin' on the sidewalk.

759
01:17:54,861 --> 01:17:56,279
You understand?

760
01:17:57,113 --> 01:18:01,617
Now, I have done nothing
to hurt these people.

761
01:18:01,826 --> 01:18:04,579
But they're angered at me.
So what do they do?

762
01:18:04,787 --> 01:18:11,252
Doctor up some income tax, for which
they got no case, to annoy me.

763
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,088
To speak to me like men? No.

764
01:18:14,297 --> 01:18:17,216
To harass a peaceful man.

765
01:18:18,634 --> 01:18:20,678
I pray to God that
if I ever have a grievance,

766
01:18:20,887 --> 01:18:24,265
I would have
just a little more self respect.

767
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:30,813
I'll tell you one more thing.
In an all-out prize fight,

768
01:18:31,022 --> 01:18:33,983
when one guy's left standing,
that's how you know who won.

769
01:21:21,692 --> 01:21:23,945
Isn't that just like a wop?

770
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:27,865
Brings a knife to a gun fight.

771
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:34,705
Get out of here, ya dago bastard!

772
01:21:36,082 --> 01:21:38,209
Go on, get your ass out of here!

773
01:23:20,478 --> 01:23:22,230
Shots! Shots! I heard shots!

774
01:23:22,438 --> 01:23:26,067
Stay back, everybody stay back,
right now.

775
01:23:26,317 --> 01:23:27,693
Round the back.

776
01:23:37,286 --> 01:23:39,497
Malone!

777
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:44,418
Malone.

778
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:14,282
Goddamn! Stone!

779
01:24:16,826 --> 01:24:18,995
Stone!

780
01:24:20,246 --> 01:24:22,623
The phone!

781
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:27,295
Oh, God. Call an ambulance!

782
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:33,759
This is Stone, Treasury Department,
1634 Racine, we need an ambulance.

783
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:36,888
- What?
- 1634 Racine!

784
01:24:37,388 --> 01:24:40,683
This? You want this?

785
01:24:44,854 --> 01:24:46,772
You want this?

786
01:24:53,779 --> 01:24:55,448
What?

787
01:25:02,622 --> 01:25:04,624
- Bookkeeper.
- What?

788
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:07,919
- Book ...
- The bookkeeper?

789
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:11,339
- Bookkeeper!
- The bookkeeper? What?

790
01:25:12,548 --> 01:25:14,842
- The bookkeeper, he's on this train?
- Yes.

791
01:25:15,092 --> 01:25:17,136
He's on this train.

792
01:25:18,262 --> 01:25:21,766
Now! What are you prepared to do?!

793
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:27,230
No. Malone. No.

794
01:25:27,438 --> 01:25:30,191
Stay. Stay.

795
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:32,819
Stay! Malone ...

796
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:35,071
No. No, no!

797
01:25:36,864 --> 01:25:40,368
Not this ... Not this man ...

798
01:26:06,102 --> 01:26:10,648
Train's leavin' for Miami
12:05, Mr. Ness.

799
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:14,402
We'll be there.

800
01:26:16,612 --> 01:26:19,991
The bookkeeper's no good to us dead.

801
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:22,952
- Stone?
- Yes, sir.

802
01:26:33,504 --> 01:26:35,631
Cover the south entrance.

803
01:27:23,721 --> 01:27:26,891
We're almost home.
We're almost home.

804
01:27:29,393 --> 01:27:35,358
Your attention, please. The Miami
Flier departs at 12:05 from 33.

805
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:37,610
All aboard.

806
01:27:48,913 --> 01:27:52,041
Stay right there.
Stay right there.

807
01:27:53,125 --> 01:27:56,587
Stay right there.
Stay right there, honey.

808
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:12,436
Your attention, please.
The Miami Flier, leaving at 12:05,

809
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:16,566
now boarding on track 33.
All aboard!

810
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:33,249
Just here.
I'm just gonna leave this right here.

811
01:29:23,007 --> 01:29:28,095
Your attention, please.
The Miami Flier, leaving at 12:05,

812
01:29:28,304 --> 01:29:33,559
is now boarding on track 33.
All aboard!

813
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:36,145
One more. Here we go.

814
01:29:58,668 --> 01:30:00,461
Here we go. You ready?

815
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,466
I'm right here, honey. Here we go.

816
01:30:06,884 --> 01:30:10,638
Your attention, please.
May I have your attention, please?

817
01:30:10,888 --> 01:30:13,432
This is the final call
for the Miami Flier,

818
01:30:13,683 --> 01:30:17,937
leaving at 12:05 on track 33.
All aboard!

819
01:30:57,268 --> 01:31:02,732
- Here, let me. Get your bags.
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

820
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:06,360
Are you all right? Thank you.

821
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:11,032
You're such a gentleman.
It's so kind of you to help me.

822
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:15,244
I really wasn't sure
if we'd make it or not.

823
01:31:18,915 --> 01:31:21,834
Is there some problem
I can help you with?

824
01:31:22,084 --> 01:31:26,130
- No.
- I really can't thank you enough.

825
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:34,305
Isn't this fun? You're being
such a good boy, sweetheart.

826
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:39,810
Thank you again,
this is so wonderful.

827
01:31:41,771 --> 01:31:43,898
Thank you, sir.

828
01:31:52,532 --> 01:31:56,202
Please, let me take it from here.
You've been such a great help.

829
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,497
Thank you so much.
We're almost there.

830
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:07,129
I'll take it from here, sir.
Thank you very much for your help.

831
01:32:09,298 --> 01:32:12,927
Don't cry, sweetheart.
We're almost home.

832
01:32:14,136 --> 01:32:16,347
Is something wrong?

833
01:32:17,598 --> 01:32:18,933
Sir?

834
01:34:14,841 --> 01:34:17,468
Come on!
Come on, let's get out of here.

835
01:34:18,261 --> 01:34:21,806
- What are you doin'?
- Shut up!

836
01:34:25,309 --> 01:34:27,854
- What are you doin'?
- Shut the fuck up!

837
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:31,399
- Hold it!
- Please ...

838
01:34:31,607 --> 01:34:34,235
- My baby!
- Stay there. He's all right.

839
01:34:36,988 --> 01:34:38,781
I said hold it!

840
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:42,743
I'm walkin' out with the bookkeeper.

841
01:34:42,994 --> 01:34:45,913
The bookkeeper and me
are drivin' away.

842
01:34:48,583 --> 01:34:50,793
See? Or else he dies.

843
01:34:51,002 --> 01:34:54,046
He dies, and you ain't got nothin'.

844
01:34:57,466 --> 01:35:00,678
You got five seconds
to make up your mind.

845
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:06,434
- I'll tell ya what ya want to know!
- Shut up! I'm not kiddin'!

846
01:35:06,642 --> 01:35:11,063
He's crazy! Don't let him do this,
I'll tell you what you want to know!

847
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:13,774
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

848
01:35:18,821 --> 01:35:20,865
- One!
- Will you stop it!

849
01:35:27,413 --> 01:35:29,415
Take him.

850
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:33,544
Two.

851
01:35:59,695 --> 01:36:02,365
The two coded entries
in this ledger ...

852
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:07,245
represent cash disbursement
to all levels of city officials,

853
01:36:07,453 --> 01:36:13,125
members of the police
and to Alphonse Capone.

854
01:36:15,127 --> 01:36:17,964
- That's correct.
- Excuse me?

855
01:36:19,549 --> 01:36:21,801
I said that is correct.

856
01:36:22,051 --> 01:36:26,848
And you will decipher
these coded entries for us?

857
01:36:29,058 --> 01:36:31,185
I will.

858
01:36:31,394 --> 01:36:33,729
Sorry, Mr. Payne, I can't hear you.

859
01:36:33,938 --> 01:36:36,732
I said, I will.

860
01:36:36,941 --> 01:36:41,654
You were in charge
of disbursements for Mr. Capone?

861
01:36:41,863 --> 01:36:43,197
Yes, I was.

862
01:36:43,406 --> 01:36:46,450
And you personally
distributed monies ...

863
01:36:46,659 --> 01:36:50,705
vast, undeclared monies ...

864
01:36:50,913 --> 01:36:54,250
to Mr. Capone?

865
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:56,836
Yes, I did.

866
01:36:57,044 --> 01:36:59,881
Would you tell us the amounts?

867
01:37:01,299 --> 01:37:07,430
In a three-year period I personally
disbursed monies to Mr. Capone ...

868
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:12,560
in excess of one
and a third million dollars.

869
01:37:15,354 --> 01:37:18,232
Would you repeat that amount, please?

870
01:37:19,317 --> 01:37:25,072
- One and a third million dollars.
- Thank you very much.

871
01:37:40,505 --> 01:37:43,716
I don't understand it.
What does Capone have?

872
01:37:43,966 --> 01:37:48,095
We're nailing the lid on his coffin,
and he's smiling.

873
01:38:11,202 --> 01:38:14,497
The son-of-a-bitch
is wearing a gun in court.

874
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:20,127
Get me the bailiff.

875
01:38:21,754 --> 01:38:23,130
It'll be a fast trial.

876
01:38:26,926 --> 01:38:31,347
The man in the front row wearing
a white suit is carrying a gun.

877
01:38:31,556 --> 01:38:36,477
I don't want this to turn
into something. I'll lead you out.

878
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:46,404
Could we speak to you
a minute, please?

879
01:39:14,557 --> 01:39:19,562
- Get up against it.
- You heard him. Now, up against it!

880
01:39:20,605 --> 01:39:24,358
- What's this?
- Empty all your pockets, all of it.

881
01:39:24,609 --> 01:39:28,196
- I've got a permit for that.
- Fine, let's see it.

882
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:36,162
- I'm not the one under indictment.
- Everything on the table.

883
01:39:38,789 --> 01:39:41,000
- Let me see.
- Give him his gun back.

884
01:39:41,209 --> 01:39:43,461
"To Whom It May Concern.
Please extend to the bearer,"

885
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:47,507
"Mr. Frank Nitti, all possible
courtesy and consideration."

886
01:39:47,757 --> 01:39:50,176
"William Thompson,
Mayor of the City of Chicago."

887
01:39:50,384 --> 01:39:53,846
I'm sorry, Mr. Ness,
you'll have to give it back.

888
01:39:54,055 --> 01:39:58,017
Fine. But that man does not go
back into that courtroom.

889
01:39:58,226 --> 01:40:01,395
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

890
01:40:31,551 --> 01:40:36,848
1634 Racine ... You know, I used
to have a friend who lived there.

891
01:40:50,987 --> 01:40:53,614
Don't. Let him go.

892
01:40:57,285 --> 01:41:00,454
- No!
- Here, take it.

893
01:45:10,872 --> 01:45:16,210
Here I am, Treasury Man.
Come on! Harass me!

894
01:45:17,712 --> 01:45:19,964
What are you waitin' for?

895
01:45:21,048 --> 01:45:24,051
Don't just stand there!
Harass me!

896
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:30,516
Don't push me.

897
01:45:33,186 --> 01:45:35,897
- They're gonna burn you, buddy.
- Yeah?

898
01:45:36,105 --> 01:45:39,233
Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn,
you son-of-a-bitch!

899
01:45:39,442 --> 01:45:41,611
'Cause you killed my friend!

900
01:45:41,819 --> 01:45:45,448
- He died like a pig.
- What did you say?

901
01:45:45,698 --> 01:45:49,285
I said that your friend died
screaming like a stuck Irish pig.

902
01:45:49,535 --> 01:45:52,997
Now you think about that
when I beat the rap.

903
01:46:06,511 --> 01:46:09,222
Did he sound anything like that?

904
01:46:39,627 --> 01:46:42,547
One picture, come on, one picture.

905
01:46:45,132 --> 01:46:47,802
Mr. Ness, take a look at this.

906
01:46:49,387 --> 01:46:51,180
Mr. Ness?

907
01:46:52,807 --> 01:46:57,270
Mr. Ness, are you doin' okay?
I think you'd better see this.

908
01:46:58,354 --> 01:47:01,232
- What is it?
- That's the jury list, Mr. Ness.

909
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,234
They've been bribed.

910
01:47:03,442 --> 01:47:07,530
I got it out of Nitti's coat.
Where is Nitti?

911
01:47:09,073 --> 01:47:11,200
He's in the car.

912
01:47:30,011 --> 01:47:34,140
This constitutes no evidence.
I'm not about to allow ...

913
01:47:34,348 --> 01:47:40,021
Your Honour, the truth is that Capone
is a killer and he will go free.

914
01:47:40,271 --> 01:47:45,151
There is only one way to deal with
such men, and that is hunt them down.

915
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:49,447
I have. I have forsworn myself.
I have broken laws I swore to defend.

916
01:47:49,655 --> 01:47:54,285
I am content that I have done right.
That man must be stopped, you must ...

917
01:47:54,494 --> 01:47:57,914
I'll be the judge
of what I must do, Mr. Ness.

918
01:48:07,924 --> 01:48:10,510
Would you excuse us?

919
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,574
- Bailiff.
- Yes, sir.

920
01:49:19,245 --> 01:49:22,039
I want you to go next door
to Judge Hoffman's Court,

921
01:49:22,248 --> 01:49:25,376
where they've just begun hearing
a divorce action.

922
01:49:25,585 --> 01:49:30,840
I want you to bring that jury in here
and take this jury to his court.

923
01:49:32,633 --> 01:49:36,304
- Are those instructions clear?
- Yes, sir, they're clear.

924
01:49:37,388 --> 01:49:38,931
What's he talking about?

925
01:49:40,808 --> 01:49:45,271
Bailiff, I want you
to switch the juries.

926
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,815
Your Honour, I object!

927
01:49:48,024 --> 01:49:49,984
Overruled.

928
01:49:53,988 --> 01:49:55,781
What did you tell him?

929
01:49:57,575 --> 01:50:00,828
I told him his name was
in the ledger, too.

930
01:50:02,163 --> 01:50:04,957
His name wasn't in the ledger!

931
01:50:05,166 --> 01:50:08,211
Wait a second! Is this the law?
What's goin' on here?

932
01:50:08,461 --> 01:50:09,921
- You're out of order.
- What's goin' on?

933
01:50:10,129 --> 01:50:13,466
- I think ...
- Do somethin' here.

934
01:50:13,674 --> 01:50:16,260
What do I look like to you?
Do somethin'!

935
01:50:16,844 --> 01:50:18,846
Order!

936
01:50:19,931 --> 01:50:24,185
Your Honour, we'd like to withdraw
our plea of Not Guilty,

937
01:50:24,393 --> 01:50:26,354
and enter a plea of Guilty.

938
01:50:29,941 --> 01:50:32,735
- Guilty?
- Order in the court!

939
01:50:32,985 --> 01:50:34,987
Order!

940
01:50:43,663 --> 01:50:46,833
Bailiff! Bailiff!

941
01:50:47,041 --> 01:50:49,502
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!

942
01:50:51,003 --> 01:50:52,338
Eliot!

943
01:50:52,547 --> 01:50:55,716
Your Honour!
Is that justice?

944
01:50:55,925 --> 01:50:58,594
Please, why did he switch the jury?

945
01:50:58,803 --> 01:51:01,389
Are you gonna go
after the organisation?

946
01:51:01,597 --> 01:51:03,057
Excuse me.

947
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:07,645
I'm askin' Your Honour,
is this justice?

948
01:51:12,483 --> 01:51:14,735
Is this justice?

949
01:51:17,613 --> 01:51:20,324
Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

950
01:51:20,533 --> 01:51:22,034
What did you say?

951
01:51:22,243 --> 01:51:25,371
I said, never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

952
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:27,623
- What?
- You heard me, Capone. It's over.

953
01:51:27,832 --> 01:51:30,376
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge.

954
01:51:30,585 --> 01:51:33,379
Here endeth the lesson.

955
01:51:33,588 --> 01:51:37,842
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

956
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:41,262
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

957
01:52:59,423 --> 01:53:01,592
So much violence.

958
01:54:07,825 --> 01:54:10,244
Cleaning up a little.

959
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,923
I guess this is goodbye.

960
01:54:23,257 --> 01:54:24,842
Goodbye, George.

961
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:30,556
I want to ... thank you for this.

962
01:54:31,641 --> 01:54:33,434
No. Thank you.

963
01:54:49,325 --> 01:54:53,955
Mr. Ness ... I think he would have
wanted you to have that.

964
01:54:54,163 --> 01:54:57,250
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.

965
01:55:00,878 --> 01:55:03,464
I'm going home.

966
01:55:14,392 --> 01:55:17,019
Mr. Ness!
Any comment for the record?

967
01:55:17,228 --> 01:55:19,939
'The man who put
Al Capone on the spot.'

968
01:55:20,106 --> 01:55:22,692
I just happened to be there
when the wheel went round.

969
01:55:22,942 --> 01:55:25,945
They say they're going
to repeal prohibition.

970
01:55:26,154 --> 01:55:29,240
- What will you do then?
- I think I'll have a drink.

1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,700
The Pianist

2
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,010
- Mr. Szpilman?\N- Hello.

3
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,720
I came specially to meet you.\NI love your playing.

4
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,810
- Who are you?\N- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

5
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,520
- You're bleeding!\N- It's nothing.

6
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,690
You can write him a fan letter later.\NThis isn't the best time. Come on.

7
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,450
Jurek, where have you been\Nhiding her?

8
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,410
- I don't know what to take.\N- You always take too much.

9
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:24,710
How many suitcases are you taking?

10
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,920
What do you think, should I take\Nuncle Szymon's portrait?

11
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,260
Take it, don't take it,\Ntake what you like.

12
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,880
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

13
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,840
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

14
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:40,020
- I should have another case.\N- Mama, Wladek is home!

15
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Thank God.\NWladek! You're wounded?

16
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,860
- No, it was nothing.\N- I've been worried sick.

17
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,610
I told her not to worry.\NYou had your papers on you.

18
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,690
If you'd been hit by a bomb,\Nthey'd know where to take you.

19
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:57,950
Henryk, don't say things like that.\NGod forbid. God forbid.

20
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,200
- Papa, Wladek is home.\N- What did I tell you?

21
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:03,830
- What are you doing?\N- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

22
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,750
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.\N- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

23
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,800
Pack, darling.\NGet your things packed.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,050
- Where are we going?\N- Out of Warsaw.

25
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,880
- Out of Warsaw where?\N- You haven't heard?

26
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,720
- Heard what?\N- Haven't you seen the paper?

27
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,430
- Where's the paper?\N- I used it for packing.

28
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,140
- She used it for packing.\N- The government has moved to Lublin.

29
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,770
All men must leave the city, go across\Nthe river, set up a new line of defense.

30
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,900
There isn't anybody left here, only\Nthe women. The men are all gone.

31
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,740
What do you think you'll do while\Nthey set up a new line of defense?

32
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,240
- Wonder around with your suitcases?\N- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

33
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:43,240
- I'm not going anywhere.\N- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

34
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,080
Don't be ridiculous,\Nwe've got to keep together.

35
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,630
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to\Ndie in my own home, staying put.

36
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:53,710
- God forbid.\N- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

37
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,090
...from the BBC in London.\NThe British government...

38
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,640
having received no reply\Nto the observations presented...

39
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,100
to the German government...

40
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:09,270
has declared war on nazi Germany.

41
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:13,230
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!\N- It is expected that...

42
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:23,330
...within the next few hours, France\Nwill make a similar declaration.

43
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,910
Poland is no longer alone.

44
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,340
Wonderful, wonderful!

45
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,970
- Mama, that was a great dinner.\N- It certainly was.

46
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,680
When there's something to celebrate,\Nyou've got to make an effort.

47
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,850
Here's to Great Britain and France!

48
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,850
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?\NAll will be well.

49
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,310
Five thousand and three.

50
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,640
- Is that all?\N- Yes. It's all we've got left.

51
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,020
- It's 3,003 too much.\N- Look.

52
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,610
"Further restrictions\Nregarding liquid assets.

53
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:41,030
Jews will be allowed to keep a\Nmaximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "

54
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:45,740
- What do we do with the rest?\N- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

55
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,700
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough\Nto deposit money in a German bank?

56
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,540
We could hide the money. Look here.\NWe can hide it under the flowerpots.

57
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,800
I'll tell you what we'll do.\NWe'll use try and tested methods.

58
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,420
You know what we did\Nin the last war?

59
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,510
We made a hole in the table leg,\Nand hid the money in there.

60
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,180
- Suppose they take the table away?\N- What do you mean?

61
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,980
Germans go into Jewish homes and\Ntake furniture, valuables, anything.

62
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:14,980
- Do they?\N- Why'd they want a table like this?

63
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,230
- What on earth are you doing?\N- Listen. Look.

64
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:23,530
This is the best place. No-one would\Nthink of looking under the flowerpot.

65
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,870
- No, listen. I've been thinking...\N- Really? That's a change.

66
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,370
- You know what? We use psychology.\N- We use what?

67
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:35,500
We leave the money and the watch\Non the table, covered. In full view.

68
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,260
- Are you stupid?\N- The Germans will never notice it.

69
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,390
That's the stupidest thing I've ever\Nseen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

70
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:47,970
Look here.

71
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,060
Idiot.

72
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,100
- And you call me stupid.\N- Very good. That's the last place...

73
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,400
- This would take hours.\N- We're not in a hurry.

74
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,820
- It won't take hours.\N- How will you get them out? Tell me.

75
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:02,070
- How will you get them out?\N- Quiet! Order, please!

76
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,990
- You reach them out individually.\N- No-one listens to me!

77
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,030
Quiet, please, quiet.\NOrder, order, please.

78
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,500
- The lawyer, she likes order.\N- Listen, just listen. Look.

79
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,290
The watch we put under the flowerpot\Nand the money we stuff in the violin.

80
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,960
- But I'll still be able to play?\N- You'll find out.

81
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,930
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.\N- Wladek, how are you?

82
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,180
We're fine, thank you.\NAnd you?

83
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,640
Fine, under the circumstances.\NI guess I know why you're calling.

84
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,020
There's nothing we can do.\NThey won't reopen the station.

85
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:43,990
- Yes, I know, but I...\N- No music, no radio for the Polish.

86
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:47,490
But sure you'll find work.\NA pianist like you.

87
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,120
Maybe, maybe not, but...

88
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:55,460
don't be offended, but I didn't call\Nto discuss my future carrier.

89
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,880
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,\Nand at last he gave in and said...

90
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,250
"All right, come with me tomorrow",\Nso I came and...

91
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,840
they bombed the station.

92
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,550
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.\N- Really?

93
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,220
Yes, it was unforgettable.

94
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,020
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.\N- Call me Wladek, please.

95
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,480
- No-one plays Chopin like you.\N- I hope it's a compliment.

96
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:23,360
- Of course, I mean it.\N- I was... trying to be funny.

97
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,860
- Should we go and have a coffee?\N- I'd like that.

98
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,160
- And you, what do you do?\N- I finished with the conservatoire.

99
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:36,330
- You're a musician?\N- Yes. But only just.

100
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,120
- What instrument?\N- The cello.

101
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,920
I love to see women\Nplaying the cello.

102
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,340
JEWS FORBIDDEN

103
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,800
This is disgraceful.\NHow dare they?

104
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,850
You know what people are like, they\Nwant to be better nazis than Hitler.

105
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:56,930
- I'm going in there to complain.\N- It's better not, believe me.

106
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,440
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!\N- Good-bye.

107
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:07,240
We'll find somewhere else.

108
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,740
- We can walk in the park.\N- No, we can't.

109
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,280
Official decree.\NNo Jews allowed in the park.

110
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,620
- My God. Are you joking?\N- I'm not joking, it's true.

111
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,710
We could sit in a bench, but\N"no Jews allowed on public benches".

112
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,750
This is absurd.

113
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:30,880
We can just stand here and talk.\NI think we're allowed to do that.

114
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,430
So, you play the cello. That's nice.\NAnd who's your favorite composer?

115
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,980
Chopin? Really? Well...

116
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,100
you'll have to learn to play\Nhis cello sonata, won't you?

117
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:44,440
What about you, Wladek?

118
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,610
Perhaps I could accompany.\NMe on the piano, you on the cello.

119
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,160
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,\Nquite wonderful.

120
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,450
Call me Wladek, please.

121
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:00,330
"Free emblems for Jews\Nin the Warsaw district.

Let me see this.

135
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,770
Does it say that we have to provide\Nthese armbands ourselves?

136
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,740
- Where will we get them?\N- We're not going to wear them.

You!

I'm sorry.

00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,860
Go to the gutter.

- Have you seen this?\N- What? What? I'm working. What?

144
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,510
What is this?

There'll be created a Jewish district\Nin which Jews will have to reside. "

No, 360 thousand.\NSo it will be easy.

What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

160

That's the price.\NThat's what I'm offering.

164
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:51,230
What are you going to do when\Nyou're hungry? Eat the piano?

165

00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,360

Haven't you eaten today?\NWhat are you suffering from?

Hello. Hi.

- How are you doing?\N- Fine.

178
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,390
Good.

179
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,270
No, not really.\NThey arrested my cousin.

180
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,850
Jurek says they'll let him out.

181
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,690
- This is disgraceful.\N- It won't last long. Don't worry.

182
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,860
That's what I said myself.

183
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,740
It's too absurd.

184
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:33,910
I... I should go.

185
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,710
Well, I'll see you...

Well...

189
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,070
to tell you the truth,\NI thought it would be worse.

190
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,710
- Where will we sleep?\N- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

191
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,920
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

192
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,470
Look.

193
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,010
Come and look.

194
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,250
Go away.

195
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,710
Go away! Go away!

196
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,970
Papa! Papa!

00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:29,280
- Sell anything?\N- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

- 3 zlotys.\N- It's better than yesterday.

199
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,580
Three lousy zlotys. And there are\Npeople there making millions.

200
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,460
- I know.\N- You don't know, believe me.

201
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:43,080
They bribe the guards,\Nthe guards turn a blind eye.

202
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:48,090
They bring cartloads of food,\Ntobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

203
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,090
And the poor are dying all around\Nand they don't give a damn.

204
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,100
Excuse me, have you seen\Nmy husband, Izaak Szerman?

205
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:58,520
A tall handsome man,\Nwith a little gray beard.

206
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:03,270
- I'm afraid not.\N- Excuse me. Good-bye.

207
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,150
Sleep well. But if you see him,\Nwrite to me, yes?

208
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,400
Izaak Szerman.

209
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,630
Why do we have to have a gentile\Nstreet running through our area?

210
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,010
Why can't they go around?

211
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,930
Don't worry. They're about to build\Na bridge. Haven't you heard?

212
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,850
A bridge! Those idiots.

213
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,640
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

214
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:44,350
But do you know what I think?\NI think they're totally stupid.

215
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,570
I have a family to feed.\NI spend half of my time here...

216
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:50,030
waiting for them to let us through.

217
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,490
Maybe they think I come here\Nto listen to the music?

218
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:58,870
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?\N- What's wrong with you?

219
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,370
- Come on, do something.\N- Right. Dance!

220
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:06,330
- Dance!\N- Dance!

221
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,460
Come on, come on! Dance!

222
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,510
Very well.

223
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,680
What about you?\NDance with him.

224
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:22,430
Let's clear the street,\Nso the Jews can dance.

225
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,020
Come on. And you.

226
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,820
Go on.

227
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,330
Faster!

228
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,200
Come on!

229
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,910
Faster!

230
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,500
Come on!

231
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,010
Faster!

232
00:19:56,260 --> 00:20:00,930
Come on, move! I said faster!\NCome on, Jews!

233
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:04,140
- Keep dancing.\N- Dance.

234
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:24,660
Good, they're here.

235
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,330
Itzak Heller has been\Nwaiting for you.

236
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,090
- What's this about?\N- Sit down, have tea.

237
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,760
I'll start lunch\Nwhen the girls get here.

238
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,980
- So, what are you doing here?\N- He brought cakes.

239
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:54,820
His father is back in the jewellery\Nbusiness. He's doing well.

240
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,780
Amazing, jewellery.

241
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,370
- We're recruiting.\N- Who is recruiting?

242
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,040
Don't be clever with me.\NI'm coming as a friend.

243
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,460
They're bringing Jews in\Nfrom all over the country.

244
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,710
Soon there will be half million people\Nin the ghetto.

245
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:13,880
- We need more Jewish police.\N- More Jewish police!

246
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:17,590
You want me to beat up Jews\Nand catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

247
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:20,340
- Someone has got to do it.\N- But why me?

248
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,930
I thought you only recruited boys\Nwith rich fathers.

249
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,140
Look at my father, look at us...

250
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,480
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm\Nhere. You can have a better life.

251
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,110
- You want to survive selling books?\N- Yes, please.

252
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,690
I'm doing you people a favor.

253
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,650
What about you?\NYou're a great pianist.

254
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,320
We've got a police jazz band.\NThey'd welcome you with open arms.

255
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,700
- Join us. You've got no work.\N- Thank you, I've got work.

256
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,920
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

257
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,880
Who wants me to stop?

258
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,980
I always say,\Nlook on the bright side.

259
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:37,610
You're in a small ghetto with\Nintellectuals, professional people.

260
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,360
You're better off than us. Here in\Nthe large ghetto it's a cesspool.

261
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:44,700
- You have to give me something.\N- You're an artist...

262
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,950
you keep peoples' spirits up.\NYou do enough.

263
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,700
- I want to help, do something.\N- You're too well known.

264
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:55,830
And you know what? You musicians\Ndon't make good conspirators.

265
00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,170
You're too... too musical.

266
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,140
- Who is that?\N- Symche.

267
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,510
Majorek.

268
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,730
There are notices going up. City is\Nto be cleansed of the undesirables.

269
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:16,940
- There's always notices going up.\N- Hello, Symche.

270
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:21,320
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

271
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,150
Jehuda, working hard?

272
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,320
This is the greatest pianist in\NPoland. Maybe the whole world.

273
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,450
Wladyslaw Szpilman,\Nmeet Majorek.

274
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,500
- How do you do?\N- I know your name.

275
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,210
- I've never heard you play.\N- Majorek used to be in the Army.

276
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,420
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got\Nagainst him is he's not a socialist.

277
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,180
You better go now, Wladek.\NIt's nearly curfew.

278
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:52,140
You know how many copies\Nwe print of our newspaper?

279
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,350
Five hundred.

280
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,850
You know how many people on\Naverage read one copy? Twenty.

281
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:02,690
That makes 10 thousand readers.\NThis will start the uprising.

282
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:06,150
Majorek hides them in his underpants\Nand leaves them in toilets.

283
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:09,200
- Toilets?\N- As many toilets as I can find.

284
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,950
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

285
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
They're too clean for them.

286
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,920
Please, mister, please.

287
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,490
Hold it!\NYou little bastard!

288
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,460
Take this!

289
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,670
Stop it! Stop it!

290
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:03,670
Stop it!

291
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,630
Come on, come on.\NCome on, boy.

292
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,640
Stand up! Stand up.

293
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:54,260
Please, tonight for once, I don't\Nwant anything bad talked about.

294
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:58,010
- Enjoy your meal.\N- Then I'll tell you something funny.

295
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,230
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?\N- The surgeon.

296
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,270
The Germans allowed him into\Nthe ghetto to perform an operation.

297
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,650
On a Jew? They let a Pole\Nto come in to operate on a Jew?

298
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,280
He got a pass, that's all I know.\NAnyway, so...

299
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,870
he puts the patient to sleep\Nand starts the operation.

300
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:18,370
He'd just made the first incision\Nwhen the SS burst in...

301
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:23,160
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja\Nand everybody else who was there.

302
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,960
Isn't that a laugh?

303
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,090
The patient didn't feel a thing,\Nhe was anesthetized.

304
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,090
I said nothing bad.

305
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:38,510
What's the matter with you all?\NYou lost your sense of humor?

306
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,390
It's not funny.

307
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,020
You know what's funny? You're\Nfunny, with that ridiculous tie.

308
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
What are you talking about? What's\Nmy tie have to do with anything?

309
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,860
- I need this tie for my work.\N- Your work?

310
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:56,360
- That's right, I work.\N- Playing the piano for the parasites.

311
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,740
- Parasites...\N- Boys. Boys!

312
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:02,500
- They don't give a damn.\N- And you blame me for their apathy?

313
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,210
I see it everyday. They don't even\Nnotice what's going around them.

314
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,380
- I blame the Americans.\N- For what? For my tie?

315
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,760
The American Jews,\Nand there are lots of them.

316
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:16,050
What do they think they're doing?\NPeople here are dying.

317
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,550
Haven't got a bite to eat.

318
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:24,060
The Jewish bankers should persuade\NAmerica to declare war on Germany.

319
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,160
The lights! The lights!

320
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,310
Turn on the lights.

321
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,690
Come on!

322
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:17,950
Open the door!\NWe want to go in!

323
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,780
Open the door!

324
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,670
Stand up!

325
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,430
You, stand up! Come on!

326
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,640
Throw him out!

327
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,990
Mama...

328
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,800
Come on, run!

329
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:29,040
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.\N- Go in. Not you.

330
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,970
- What?\N- Come. It's terrible.

331
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,310
- What?\N- They're hunting people in the streets.

332
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,770
They've taken Henryk.

333
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,400
Go home, alright? Go home,\NI'll take care of it.

334
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,750
Excuse me. Have you seen\Nmy husband? Izaak Szerman?

335
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,840
- I'm afraid not.\N- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

336
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:24,760
If you see him, write to me.\NDon't forget. Izaak Szerman.

337
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:36,520
What happened here?

338
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:40,480
They've got my grandson. They\Npick them up and take them away.

339
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:44,400
What they do to them,\NI've stopped believing in God.

340
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,110
Excuse me. Excuse me.

341
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,030
Itzak?

342
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,160
Itzak?

343
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,870
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

344
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:05,670
- Henryk is in there.\N- I haven't seen him.

345
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,050
Believe me.\NThey picked him up.

346
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:16,390
- Can you help?\N- Now you need me. Now you need me!

347
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,810
Can you help us?

348
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,190
- It costs.\N- I have no money.

349
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,990
Then there's nothing I can do.\NYou should have joined us.

350
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,610
- They told me you had influence.\N- Who told you?

351
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,370
People I know. They said\Nyou're an important man.

352
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:38,500
Itzak...

353
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,350
- Hands up.\N- How are you?

354
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,270
- How are you?\N- You, bandit.

355
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,650
Dead! Dead!

356
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:07,070
- He's crazy.\N- Hands up.

357
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,410
- Want a cigarette?\N- Cigarette?

358
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:13,910
Thank you.

359
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,580
Everything is alright!

360
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,920
He looks very happy.

361
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:24,000
Everything is alright.

362
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:27,630
Everything is alright.

363
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,760
Hands up! Hands up!

364
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,640
It's alright.

365
00:34:35,430 --> 00:34:37,640
Help! Help!

366
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:41,480
Let go! Help!

367
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,240
- Why did they pick you up?\N- So you go to Itzak Heller?

368
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,000
- Did I ask you to talk to him?\N- You're out, aren't you?

369
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,130
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?\N- I asked him to help you.

370
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,010
What did you pay him?

371
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,470
With what could I pay him? Every\Nzloty I earn we spend on food.

372
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,720
- I can look after myself.\N- They were taking you away.

373
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,850
It's got nothing to do with you.\NIt's me they wanted, not you.

374
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,400
Why do you have to interfere\Nwith other people's business?

375
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,730
- You're mad. That's your trouble.\N- That's also my business.

376
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,290
What's the matter?\NAre you sick?

377
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,750
Hungry.

378
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:38,300
Employment certificate. What's that\Nmean, no employment certificate?

379
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:41,350
You have to have an\Nemployment certificate...

380
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,140
to work for the Germans\Nin the ghetto, otherwise...

381
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:47,190
- Otherwise what?\N- You'll be deported.

382
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,730
- So the rumors were true.\N- They're going to resettle us...

383
00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:54,780
and send us to labor camps,\Nin the East.

384
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,700
- They're closing the small ghetto.\N- Oh, God!

385
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:16,930
Wladek? Wladek?

386
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:21,890
I thought you were on tour playing\Nin London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

387
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,890
- Not this week.\N- You look terrible.

388
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,060
Have you heard the rumors? They're\Ngoing to resettle us in the East.

389
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:32,400
Rumors! You take it all too much\Nto heart. What's the trouble?

390
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:37,030
I've been trying to get the certificate\Nof employment for my father.

391
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,620
I managed to get one for me and my\Nfamily, but I need one for my father.

392
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,040
- I've been to all the firms and shops...\N- Why didn't you come to me?

393
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:46,410
I didn't know you were\Nin the certificate business.

394
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,080
I'm not, but Majorek is.

395
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,380
Can you help?\NI have no money.

396
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,970
Please, don't insult us.\NCan you do something for him?

397
00:37:57,170 --> 00:37:59,590
Be at the Schultz workshop\Ntomorrow, four o'clock.

398
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,550
See what a wonderful piece\Nof luck you've had today?

399
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,640
That's the historical imperative in\Naction! That's why I always say:

400
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:09,230
- "Look on the bright side!"\N- Yes, I know.

401
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:24,950
- How's your back?\N- Better.

402
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
Better?

403
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:29,330
Better not ask.

404
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:47,520
- Thank you.\N- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

405
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,310
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

406
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:06,340
At least we got work\Nin the ghetto.

407
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,720
At least we are still together.

408
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:26,410
Everybody out!\NTo the courtyard!

409
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,990
Move, move!

410
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,960
We are workers. We have\Nemployment certification.

411
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,880
Wait.

412
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,630
Here.

413
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,050
Go over there. Hurry.

414
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,260
You.

415
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,350
You. You.

416
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,930
You.

417
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,560
You.

418
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:01,150
You.

419
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,410
The others, put your clothes on\Nand come back here.

420
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:16,830
Bring your things with you.\N15 kilos only.

421
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,960
Where are you taking us?

422
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,240
I'm sorry, I did my best.

423
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:51,620
- I thought the certificates'd save us.\N- Stop it, Wladek.

424
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,410
Let's just hope that Henryk\Nand Halina will be better off.

425
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:25,280
- Where will we be going?\N- You're going to work.

426
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,860
You'll be much better off than\Nin the stinking ghetto. Move.

427
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,450
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

428
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,540
Why did I do it?\NWhy did I do it?

429
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,380
Why did I do it?

430
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,300
Don't you have a bottle of water?\NHe's dying.

431
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,430
My child is dying of thirst.

432
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,520
- I beg you.\N- I'm sorry.

433
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:42,600
- Don't you have water? I beg you.\N- Can you hear what I'm saying?

434
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,110
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.\N- I can hear you.

435
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:47,650
Letting them take us to our death\Nlike sheep to the slaughter.

436
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:49,990
- Not so loud.\N- Why don't we attack them?

437
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,360
There's half a million of us here.\NWe can break out of the ghetto.

438
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,280
At least we can die honorably, not\Nas a stain on the face of History.

439
00:43:56,490 --> 00:43:59,200
Why are you so sure they're\Nsending us to our death?

440
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:02,000
You know why I'm not sure?\NBecause they didn't tell me.

441
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:06,250
- They're going to wipe us all out.\N- What do you want me to do? Fight?

442
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,090
To fight, we need organization,\Nplans, guns.

443
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,920
He's right. Do you think I'm going\Nto fight with my violin bowl?

444
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,970
The Germans would never squander\Na huge labor force like this.

445
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,600
They're sending us to a labor camp,\Nit's obvious.

446
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,180
Sure.

447
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:23,770
Look at that cripple, the old people,\Nthe children. They're going to work?

448
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,770
Look at you. You're going to carry\Nlogs on your back?

449
00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,070
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

450
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:27,420
I missed you.\NI wanted to be with you!

451
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,760
I wanted to be with you!

452
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:41,050
Stupid. Stupid.

453
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:45,680
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

454
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:49,150
She's getting on my nerves.

455
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:58,110
- What did she do, for God's sake?\N- She smothered her baby.

456
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,660
They prepared a hiding place\Nand of course they went there.

457
00:46:03,870 --> 00:46:06,750
The baby cried\Njust as the police came.

458
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,130
She smothered the cries with\Nher hands, the baby died.

459
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,170
A policeman heard the death rattle\Nand found where they were hiding.

460
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,620
What are you reading?

461
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:50,920
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?\NIf you tickle us, do we not laugh?

462
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:53,340
If you poison us, do we not die?

463
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:56,670
And, if you wrong us,\Nshall we not revenge?"

464
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:07,810
- Very appropriate.\N- Yes. That's why I brought it.

465
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:29,290
Idiot. What does he think\Nhe's gonna do with the money?

466
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:33,120
Boy, come here.

467
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:35,670
Come here.

468
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,010
- How much for a caramel?\N- 20 zlotys.

469
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:42,680
For one caramel? What do you think\Nyou're gonna do with the money?

470
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,180
20 zlotys.

471
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,930
We've got 20 between us.

472
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,690
I've got 10, I think.

473
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,230
5, 10, 20.

474
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:22,780
- Halina?\N- What?

475
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:28,110
- It's a funny time to say this, but...\N- What?

476
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,660
I wish I knew you better.

477
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,420
Thank you.

478
00:49:53,810 --> 00:49:55,520
Szpilman?

479
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,650
Papa? Papa?

480
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,450
Mama? Halina?

481
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:15,620
Halina? Mama?

482
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:21,250
What do you think you're doing?\NI've saved your life. Just go! Go!

483
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:27,170
Don't run!

484
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,840
Anna!

485
00:50:31,010 --> 00:50:33,390
Anna!

486
00:50:53,070 --> 00:50:56,240
Off they go to the melting pot.

487
00:50:59,290 --> 00:51:04,040
- This stays.\N- Give it to me!

488
00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:11,890
What are you doing?\NShe's pregnant.

489
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:40,870
Wladek?

490
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:02,140
Why are you here, Wladek?

491
00:54:02,350 --> 00:54:05,060
It's like this, I...

492
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,650
We...

493
00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,860
All of them, all of them.

494
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:16,280
All of them.

495
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,370
Perhaps they're lucky.\NThe quicker, the better.

496
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:24,740
It's not finished yet. We'll stay\Nhere for a couple of days...

497
00:54:24,950 --> 00:54:26,960
until things die down.

498
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:30,670
I've bribed the policeman,\Nhe'll come when it's over.

499
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,630
Attention!\NOn the march!

500
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,600
Onward!

501
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,110
My God, I haven't been outside in,\Nit must be two years.

502
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:57,320
Don't get overexcited.

503
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:16,500
It's gold.\NVery good price.

504
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:39,530
Someone you know?

505
00:55:39,690 --> 00:55:41,700
A beauty.\NWho is she?

506
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:45,990
She's a singer. I knew her well.\NHer husband is an actor.

507
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:48,660
They're good people.\NI'd like to talk to her.

508
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:52,710
Don't forget, Wladek.\NThey hang them for helping Jews.

509
00:56:19,530 --> 00:56:21,950
Turn left!

510
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,610
On the march!

511
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:31,580
Stop! Halt!\NAttention!

512
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,840
At ease.

513
00:56:45,930 --> 00:56:48,720
Turn right!

514
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:58,610
Step forward.

515
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,730
You.

516
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:05,570
You. You.

517
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,120
You.

518
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,160
Down on the ground!

519
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:17,500
Down on the ground!

520
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,910
Turn left!

521
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:50,530
On the march.

522
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:32,830
How long have you been here?

523
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:35,950
Since last night.

524
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,580
I was pleased to see you.

525
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,840
They're going to start\Nthe final resettlement now.

526
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:50,010
We know what it means.

527
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:55,020
We sent someone out.\NZygmund, a good man.

528
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,020
His orders were to follow\Nthe trains out of Warsaw.

529
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:04,570
He got to Sokolow.

530
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:09,530
A man told him the tracks divided,\None branch's leading to Treblinka.

531
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:15,160
He said everyday freight trains\Ncarrying people from Warsaw...

532
00:59:15,370 --> 00:59:19,370
branch off to Treblinka\Nand return empty.

533
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:22,580
No transports of food\Nare ever seen on that line.

534
00:59:23,420 --> 00:59:26,840
The civilians are forbidden\Nto approach the Treblinka station.

535
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,180
They're exterminating us.

536
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:39,680
It won't take them long.

537
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:44,650
We are 60 thousand left,\Nout of half a million.

538
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,030
Mostly young people.

539
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:52,360
And this time we're gonna fight.

540
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,910
We're in good shape.

541
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:01,080
Organized.\NWe're prepared.

542
01:00:01,250 --> 01:00:04,130
If you need help, I...

543
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,940
You! Come here!

544
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,780
Shit!

545
01:00:37,830 --> 01:00:40,200
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

546
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,870
I don't know what I was thinking.

547
01:00:53,130 --> 01:00:57,550
Take this! Take this!

548
01:01:12,190 --> 01:01:15,030
Take him away.

549
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:34,340
I hope you play the piano better\Nthan you carry bricks.

550
01:01:36,010 --> 01:01:38,600
He won't last long\Nif he goes on like this.

551
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,720
I'll see if I can get him\Nsomething better.

552
01:02:04,410 --> 01:02:06,160
Trouble.

553
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:08,880
Round up only the Jews!

554
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:12,050
Round up!\NOnly the Jews.

555
01:02:12,300 --> 01:02:15,720
The Polish keep working.\NOnly the Jews.

556
01:02:23,010 --> 01:02:25,980
I have good news for you.

557
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:31,110
There are rumors going around\Nthat we like to...

558
01:02:31,310 --> 01:02:34,230
to resettle you.

559
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:41,200
I promise you that now\Nand in the future...

560
01:02:41,410 --> 01:02:45,000
nothing else is planned.

561
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:52,340
For this reason, we put\Ninformation posters on the wall.

562
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:57,010
To show you our goodwill...

563
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:01,140
you should vote one of you\Nto be allowed...

564
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:04,390
to go in town daily...

565
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:10,980
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

566
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:15,690
and one loaf of bread\Nfor each of your workers.

567
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:21,320
So, why should we do something\Nlike this if we'd resettle you?

568
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:27,910
You can make good business\Nout of the things you don't eat.

569
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:35,090
Isn't that something that you Jews\Nare good in? Making money?

570
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:40,220
Dismiss them.

571
01:03:56,570 --> 01:04:00,530
That one, with the string.\NThe others, tied by wire.

572
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:10,430
Now!

573
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:49,970
Majorek.

574
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:54,640
I have a favor to ask.

575
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:57,650
I want to get out of here.

576
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:04,860
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll\Nsurvive on the other side that's hard.

577
01:06:05,070 --> 01:06:07,360
I know.

578
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:12,040
Last summer, I worked for a day\Nin the Zelazna Brama Square.

579
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:15,750
I saw someone I knew,\Nshe's an old friend.

580
01:06:15,870 --> 01:06:19,420
A singer, her husband\Nis an actor.

581
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:25,050
I've filled their names down and\Ntheir address, if they're still there.

582
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:30,180
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej\NBogucki. They're good people.

583
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:34,140
Would you try to make contact?

584
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:40,980
You go to town everyday. Ask them\Nif they'd help me get out of here.

585
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:16,640
Have you got any plaster?

586
01:07:25,980 --> 01:07:29,280
What are you up to?

587
01:07:30,860 --> 01:07:33,410
What have you got there?

588
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:37,580
We are allowed to take\Nfood to the ghetto.

589
01:07:37,790 --> 01:07:40,620
Three kilos of potato and bread.

590
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:42,920
Open it.

591
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:51,680
- It's only potatoes and bread.\N- You're lying. That's not true.

592
01:07:53,090 --> 01:07:55,260
Open it.

593
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:25,420
Potatoes!

594
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:32,090
You Jews are all alike.

595
01:08:32,300 --> 01:08:36,010
We reach you with a finger...

596
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:39,220
and you take the whole hand.

597
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:56,910
If you lie to me again,\NI'll kill you. Personally.

598
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:23,180
I've tried your friends.

599
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:26,770
- They don't live there anymore.\N- Did you make contact?

600
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,440
- Be ready to leave.\N- When?

601
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:31,570
- Soon.\N- Halt!

602
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:35,160
Shit! Shit!

603
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:38,030
Wait. What's going on here?

604
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,910
Take this! Take this!

605
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:52,210
I'll teach you some discipline,\Nyou dirty Jews.

606
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:58,930
Do you know why\Nyou're being hit?

607
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:02,270
- No.\N- Do you know why you're being hit?

608
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:07,020
- Why?\N- To celebrate New Year.

609
01:10:09,310 --> 01:10:11,570
On the march!

610
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:14,400
March and sing!

611
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,570
Sing something nice!

612
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,280
Loud and clear!

613
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:25,120
Reunite tonight\NAnd follow the white eagle

614
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:29,460
Stand up and fight\NOur mortal enemies

615
01:10:29,630 --> 01:10:33,510
Rise on the day\NLet's give them fire and brimstone

616
01:10:33,670 --> 01:10:37,680
We'll do away\NThe Yoke of slavery

617
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,640
Punish and rout\NThe rapists of our nation

618
01:10:41,810 --> 01:10:45,980
We'll slash them out\NTo save our dignity

619
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,680
Come.

620
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:37,920
I'm sorry.

621
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,880
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

622
01:13:05,910 --> 01:13:08,870
We haven't much time.\NCome on.

623
01:13:16,580 --> 01:13:18,460
We must hurry.

624
01:13:18,590 --> 01:13:20,960
Here. See if this fit.

625
01:13:21,170 --> 01:13:25,300
We have to keep moving you. Germans\Nare hunting down indiscriminately.

626
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:28,760
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

627
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:32,890
You better shave.\NUse my razor on the shelf.

628
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:50,740
You'll be looked after\Nby Gebczynski.

629
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:53,000
He's on the other side of town.

630
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:57,000
You stay there tonight,\Nthen we'll find you somewhere else.

631
01:13:57,460 --> 01:14:01,920
- I'll bring you food.\N- Alright, let's go.

632
01:14:41,250 --> 01:14:44,170
I'll show you where\Nyou're going to sleep.

633
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:17,500
You have to stay here\Nuntil tomorrow afternoon.

634
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:22,630
We have a flat for you near\Nthe ghetto wall. But it's safe.

635
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,430
It's not going to be very comfortable.

636
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:34,970
I'll be fine.

637
01:15:44,900 --> 01:15:47,070
Thank you.

638
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:05,170
Here. Here. Give it to me.

639
01:16:05,840 --> 01:16:09,800
Go as near to the front as possible,\Nto the German section.

640
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:29,940
DO NOT PASS

641
01:17:01,270 --> 01:17:03,810
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

642
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:13,070
But you leave them open\Nduring the day. Don't forget.

643
01:17:16,030 --> 01:17:19,410
Must feel better on\Nthis side of the wall, eh?

644
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,160
Yes.

645
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:27,000
But sometimes I'm still not sure\Nwhich side of the wall I'm on.

646
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:32,510
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

647
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:36,140
I'll come again.\NJanina will visit you twice a week.

648
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,810
To bring more food,\Nsee how you are.

649
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:41,310
Thank you.

650
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:46,860
This is very important.\NIn case of emergency...

651
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:51,360
I mean emergency,\Ngo to this address.

652
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,110
What do you mean you forgot?

653
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:39,280
What do you think I mean?\NI forgot, that's what I mean.

654
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:45,000
- You know, you treat me like dirt.\N- Because you are a dirt.

655
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:47,670
- Pig! Pig!\N- Bitch!

656
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:50,670
- Dirty pig!\N- You are a dirty pig!

657
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:53,590
Takes one to know one. Pig.

658
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:02,510
- You play like an angel.\N- Then why don't you listen?

659
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,930
- I'm listening.\N- Liar.

660
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:08,440
You fell asleep. Pig.

661
01:19:29,790 --> 01:19:33,840
Spread out!\NWe're being attacked!

662
01:19:36,340 --> 01:19:38,760
Take cover!

663
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:41,430
Shoot!

664
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:56,400
Take cover! Fire!

665
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:03,370
Come on, get out!

666
01:21:30,910 --> 01:21:33,210
The attack was successful.

667
01:21:35,210 --> 01:21:37,460
That building...

668
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:47,300
Turn that way!

669
01:21:54,020 --> 01:21:55,940
Shoot!

670
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:22,170
Thank you.

671
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,550
- I wanted to come earlier, but...\N- No, thank you.

672
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:36,440
No-one thought\Nthey'd hold out so long.

673
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,150
I never should've come out. I should\Nhave stayed and fought with them.

674
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,820
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

675
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:45,900
Just be proud of them.

676
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:49,660
- My God, did they put up a fight!\N- Yes.

677
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:54,540
- So did the Germans.\N- They are in shock!

678
01:22:54,750 --> 01:23:00,500
They didn't expect it. Nobody\Nexpected it. Jews fighting back.

679
01:23:00,670 --> 01:23:05,510
- Who would have thought?\N- What good did it do?

680
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:07,720
What good?

681
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:10,350
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

682
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:15,350
They died with dignity.\NAnd you know something else?

683
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:20,440
Now the Poles will rise.\NWe are ready.

684
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:24,030
We'll fight too.\NYou'll see.

685
01:23:38,290 --> 01:23:40,960
Get your things together.\NYou have to leave.

686
01:23:41,170 --> 01:23:43,800
What? What's happened?

687
01:23:46,210 --> 01:23:48,510
- I'm on the run.\N- What's happened?

688
01:23:48,720 --> 01:23:52,850
The Gestapo found our weapons.\NThey've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

689
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:57,600
They're bound to find out about this\Nplace too. You must get away at once.

690
01:23:57,810 --> 01:24:00,230
Where do you want me to go?

691
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:03,940
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

692
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:08,400
- Can I take my chances here?\N- That's your decision.

693
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:11,360
But when they storm the flat,\Nthrow yourself out the window...

694
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:13,410
don't let them get you alive.

695
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:16,830
I have poison on me.\NThey won't get me alive either.

696
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:35,240
Open up!

697
01:27:37,900 --> 01:27:42,240
Open the door\Nor we'll call the police!

698
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:14,230
Are you from this flat?\NYou're not registered.

699
01:28:14,440 --> 01:28:17,690
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just\Ncame to visit, but I missed him.

700
01:28:17,860 --> 01:28:20,320
Have you got your identity card?

701
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:23,910
- Let me see your identity card.\N- Yes, of course.

702
01:28:26,580 --> 01:28:29,080
- I want to see your identity card!\N- What's happening?

703
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:31,960
He's a Jew! A Jew!

704
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:34,040
Stop the Jew!

705
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:37,760
Don't let him out!\NStop him!

706
01:29:51,080 --> 01:29:55,330
- Yes?\N- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

707
01:30:01,460 --> 01:30:05,510
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.\N- Dorota.

708
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,810
Come in.

709
01:30:15,810 --> 01:30:17,400
I'm sorry.

710
01:30:17,610 --> 01:30:21,110
I was given this address and\NI'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

711
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:24,990
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

712
01:30:25,160 --> 01:30:26,910
Come in.

713
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:36,880
Sit.

714
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,210
I need help.

715
01:30:44,010 --> 01:30:46,930
He'll be back before curfew.

716
01:30:47,090 --> 01:30:49,720
I've been in hiding.

717
01:30:50,890 --> 01:30:54,430
- I need somewhere to stay.\N- He'll be here soon.

718
01:30:56,600 --> 01:30:59,770
- How long have you been married?\N- Just over a year.

719
01:31:02,570 --> 01:31:05,200
And how is Jurek?

720
01:31:05,400 --> 01:31:07,110
Dead.

721
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:17,620
- When is your baby due?\N- Christmas.

722
01:31:18,290 --> 01:31:22,090
This is not a good time to\Nhave children, but then...

723
01:31:24,340 --> 01:31:27,800
This is my husband.\NWladyslaw Szpilman.

724
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:32,810
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.\N- Yes, I remember.

725
01:31:34,680 --> 01:31:37,390
He said to contact you\Nonly in case of emergency.

726
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,480
Don't worry now.

727
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:52,660
We can't move you tonight.\NYou'll sleep on the sofa.

728
01:31:57,330 --> 01:31:59,170
Excuse me.

729
01:32:03,130 --> 01:32:06,170
I'm sorry,\Ncould I have a piece of bread?

730
01:32:06,380 --> 01:32:09,130
Yes, of course.\NWe will eat.

731
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:13,430
Sit. Please, sit.

732
01:32:13,640 --> 01:32:15,430
Thank you.

733
01:34:23,600 --> 01:34:26,650
You're on a very German area.

734
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:31,280
On the opposite is a hospital taking\Nwounded from the Russian front.

735
01:34:33,150 --> 01:34:36,490
And next door is the\NSchutzpolizei.

736
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:40,240
Safest place to be.

737
01:34:40,450 --> 01:34:43,370
Right at the heart\Nof the lion's den.

738
01:34:48,460 --> 01:34:50,670
I'll be locking you in.

739
01:34:50,840 --> 01:34:54,880
No-one knows you're here,\Nso keep as quiet as possible.

740
01:37:04,470 --> 01:37:06,430
All well?

741
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:09,270
Thank you.

742
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:17,320
This is Antek Szalas.\NHe'll be looking after you.

743
01:37:17,480 --> 01:37:19,320
- How do you do?\N- How do you do?

744
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:21,320
Thank you.

745
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:26,530
I've given him a second key. He'll\Nbring food, see that you're alright.

746
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,660
He's with the underground,\Nhe's a good man.

747
01:37:33,750 --> 01:37:37,960
- You don't remember me?\N- I don't think so.

748
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:41,680
Warsaw Radio.\NI was a technician.

749
01:37:42,260 --> 01:37:45,430
I saw you almost everyday.

750
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:49,470
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.\N- It doesn't matter.

751
01:37:51,730 --> 01:37:55,440
You've nothing to worry about.\NI'll visit often.

752
01:37:56,270 --> 01:37:59,070
You'll be pleased to hear that\Nthe Allies are bombing Germany...

753
01:37:59,230 --> 01:38:01,280
night after night,\Nafter night.

754
01:38:01,490 --> 01:38:03,990
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

755
01:38:04,240 --> 01:38:07,530
And the Russians are giving them\Nhell. It's the beginning of the end.

756
01:38:07,740 --> 01:38:09,330
Let's hope so.

757
01:38:20,210 --> 01:38:22,420
Come here.

758
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:24,800
Be careful with it.

759
01:38:25,720 --> 01:38:28,680
That's it. Be careful.

760
01:38:55,420 --> 01:38:58,290
Still alive then?

761
01:39:01,630 --> 01:39:05,800
Here. Sausage, bread.

762
01:39:06,010 --> 01:39:08,220
You still got that vodka?

763
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:26,530
- How long is this meant to last?\N- Not long now.

764
01:39:27,070 --> 01:39:30,240
I think I've got jaundice.

765
01:39:30,450 --> 01:39:34,290
Don't worry about that.\NIt just makes you look funny.

766
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:39,420
My grandfather was jilted by\Nhis girlfriend when he got jaundice.

767
01:39:39,630 --> 01:39:41,540
Drink up.

768
01:39:42,380 --> 01:39:45,420
Why didn't you come sooner?\NIt's been over two weeks...

769
01:39:45,630 --> 01:39:47,430
Problems.

770
01:39:47,630 --> 01:39:49,720
Money.

771
01:39:50,140 --> 01:39:52,760
I've got to raise money\Nto buy the food.

772
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:56,850
I need things to sell,\Nit's not easy.

773
01:40:00,730 --> 01:40:03,400
Here. Sell this.

774
01:40:05,740 --> 01:40:07,950
Food is more important than time.

775
01:40:13,160 --> 01:40:16,290
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!\NThe Allies have landed in France.

776
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,790
Russians will be here soon.

777
01:40:19,250 --> 01:40:22,250
They'll beat the shit\Nout of the Germans...

778
01:40:23,090 --> 01:40:25,130
any day now.

779
01:41:09,050 --> 01:41:11,090
Wladek?

780
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:23,440
I knew it.\NI knew this would happen.

781
01:41:25,690 --> 01:41:28,030
- I'll get a doctor.\N- You can't. It's too dangerous.

782
01:41:28,230 --> 01:41:31,910
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.\N- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

783
01:41:32,070 --> 01:41:34,530
- He's still a doctor.\N- No.

784
01:41:34,740 --> 01:41:37,950
You stay. I'll go.

785
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:13,910
We came to say goodbye.

786
01:42:14,110 --> 01:42:17,120
We're going to stay\Nwith my mother in Otwocks.

787
01:42:17,330 --> 01:42:20,660
The baby is already there.\NIt's safer.

788
01:42:20,830 --> 01:42:24,960
There's talk that the uprising\Nwill begin any day now.

789
01:42:26,250 --> 01:42:29,250
That man Szalas should be shot.

790
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:33,970
He's been collecting money\Non your behalf all over Warsaw.

791
01:42:34,760 --> 01:42:39,810
Apparently people gave generously,\Nso he collected a tidy sum.

792
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:46,980
My God.

793
01:42:50,150 --> 01:42:55,490
The liver the size of a football.\NInflammation of the gall bladder...

794
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:58,620
but he'll leave.

795
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:04,910
I'll try to get him some laevulose,\Nbut it's not easy.

796
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:08,790
- Can you visit him again?\N- Who knows.

797
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:13,130
- Doctor, thank you.\N- Don't speak, rest.

798
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:19,260
Thank you so much for coming.

799
01:43:20,890 --> 01:43:23,140
We've brought you some food.

800
01:43:23,350 --> 01:43:27,190
I'll prepare something now\Nfor you, then we must go.

801
01:44:08,770 --> 01:44:11,110
I'll throw a grenade!

802
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:21,910
There's a wounded man over there!

803
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:24,950
Come.

804
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,500
Watch out! Watch out!

805
01:44:28,620 --> 01:44:31,580
- I'll go get help!\N- Hurry!

806
01:44:32,250 --> 01:44:36,260
Come on! Bring the litter!

807
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:42,720
Go back inside!

808
01:46:31,790 --> 01:46:34,460
Get out, get out in the streets!

809
01:46:34,670 --> 01:46:38,460
Get out now! The Germans\Nhave surrounded the building!

810
01:47:19,540 --> 01:47:23,840
Somebody...\NSomebody help me!

811
01:48:21,730 --> 01:48:24,900
Are you alright?\NThere's too much dust.

812
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:29,860
I'll check this side.\NDon't worry.

813
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:32,530
Be careful!

814
01:48:37,960 --> 01:48:40,630
- Heinrich?\N- I'm checking!

815
01:48:43,170 --> 01:48:45,710
Is there anybody here?

816
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:53,930
- Come on down!\N- Alright, I'm coming.

817
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:03,970
Come on, pile them up.

818
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:12,520
Throw it.

819
01:54:36,770 --> 01:54:39,730
We have to mark everything.

820
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:41,740
Come on.

821
02:01:42,950 --> 02:01:45,330
What are you doing here?

822
02:01:49,790 --> 02:01:52,130
Who are you?

823
02:01:56,250 --> 02:01:59,840
- Do you understand?\N- Yes.

824
02:02:01,930 --> 02:02:04,220
What are you doing?

825
02:02:09,980 --> 02:02:11,980
I was...

826
02:02:12,100 --> 02:02:15,190
trying to open this can.

827
02:02:15,860 --> 02:02:18,530
Do you live here?

828
02:02:20,950 --> 02:02:22,910
Do you work here?

829
02:02:23,110 --> 02:02:24,820
No.

830
02:02:28,500 --> 02:02:31,000
What do you do for a living?

831
02:02:34,040 --> 02:02:35,840
I am...

832
02:02:37,460 --> 02:02:40,470
I was a pianist.

833
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:44,800
Pianist?

834
02:03:03,570 --> 02:03:05,570
Come.

835
02:03:30,520 --> 02:03:32,770
Play something.

836
02:08:51,960 --> 02:08:54,760
Are you hiding here?

837
02:08:59,510 --> 02:09:01,180
Jew?

838
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:06,600
Where are you hiding yourself?

839
02:09:08,230 --> 02:09:10,230
In the attic.

840
02:09:13,480 --> 02:09:15,820
Show it to me.

841
02:09:39,300 --> 02:09:41,590
Have you got anything to eat?

842
02:10:27,930 --> 02:10:33,520
According to them,\Nit's very important that...

843
02:10:40,240 --> 02:10:42,030
Attention!

844
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:46,790
- At ease.\N- At ease.

845
02:11:52,020 --> 02:11:54,020
Jew?

846
02:12:08,450 --> 02:12:09,910
Please.

847
02:12:10,330 --> 02:12:12,370
What does it mean,\Nall that shooting?

848
02:12:12,910 --> 02:12:15,670
The Russians,\Non the other side of the river.

849
02:12:17,040 --> 02:12:20,500
You just have to hold on\Na couple of weeks, not more.

850
02:13:52,010 --> 02:13:54,810
- What's going on?\N- We're leaving.

851
02:13:57,730 --> 02:14:01,060
- Are the Russians here?\N- Not yet.

852
02:14:03,980 --> 02:14:07,860
I don't know how to thank you.

853
02:14:09,320 --> 02:14:11,530
Thank God, not me.

854
02:14:11,950 --> 02:14:17,580
He wants us to survive. At least,\Nwe have to believe in that.

855
02:14:27,420 --> 02:14:30,760
Here. Take it.

856
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:36,100
- And you?\N- I have another one. Warmer.

857
02:14:40,520 --> 02:14:44,110
What are you going to do\Nwhen this is over?

858
02:14:45,940 --> 02:14:50,280
I'll play piano again at\Nthe Polish radio station.

859
02:14:51,150 --> 02:14:52,950
Tell me your name.

860
02:14:53,160 --> 02:14:55,830
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.

861
02:14:55,990 --> 02:14:58,120
Szpilman.

862
02:15:02,330 --> 02:15:05,210
Perfect name for a pianist.

863
02:16:27,460 --> 02:16:30,130
German! German!

864
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:55,950
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!

865
02:16:56,950 --> 02:16:58,990
I'm Polish!

866
02:16:59,780 --> 02:17:02,490
- Come out with your hands up!\N- Please! I beg of you!

867
02:17:03,200 --> 02:17:07,870
Don't shoot, don't shoot.\NI beg you, I'm a Polish.

868
02:17:08,080 --> 02:17:10,090
Come down!

869
02:17:13,630 --> 02:17:17,760
Please, I'm Polish.\NPlease.

870
02:17:17,970 --> 02:17:20,140
He's Polish.

871
02:17:23,010 --> 02:17:25,270
Yes, he's Polish.

872
02:17:26,520 --> 02:17:28,980
Why the fucking coat?

873
02:17:30,060 --> 02:17:32,320
I'm cold.

874
02:17:51,330 --> 02:17:54,340
Look at them.\NGerman fuckers!

875
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:57,920
Murderers! Murderers!

876
02:17:58,170 --> 02:18:01,390
- Dirty bastards!\N- Assassins!

877
02:18:01,590 --> 02:18:05,060
- Bastards!\N- Look at you now!

878
02:18:05,220 --> 02:18:09,190
You took everything I had.\NMe, a musician.

879
02:18:09,390 --> 02:18:12,810
You took my violin,\Nyou took my soul.

880
02:18:17,690 --> 02:18:19,360
Musician?

881
02:18:20,570 --> 02:18:22,530
Are you a musician?

882
02:18:23,490 --> 02:18:25,660
Do you know...

883
02:18:25,990 --> 02:18:29,160
a pianist called Szpilman,\Nfrom the Polish radio station?

884
02:18:29,370 --> 02:18:34,590
- Of course I know him.\N- I helped him to hide himself.

885
02:18:35,380 --> 02:18:37,510
Tell him I'm here.

886
02:18:38,300 --> 02:18:40,470
Ask him to help me.

887
02:18:43,550 --> 02:18:46,310
- What's your name?\N- Hosenfeld.

888
02:18:46,560 --> 02:18:47,770
What?

889
02:20:29,830 --> 02:20:32,450
It was here, I'm certain of it.

890
02:20:34,460 --> 02:20:36,620
Well, it's not here now.

891
02:20:36,830 --> 02:20:40,960
I shouted, abused them. I'm not\Nproud of it, but that's what I did.

892
02:20:41,210 --> 02:20:42,630
I stood where you are now.

893
02:20:43,840 --> 02:20:47,180
There was a barbed wire\Nand this German came up to me.

894
02:20:48,510 --> 02:20:52,180
- You didn't catch his name?\N- No.

895
02:20:54,350 --> 02:20:57,650
I'll ask at the factory.\NThey may know something.

5
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,150
How you doing, Keaton?

6
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,450
I can't feel my legs...

7
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,450
Keyser.

8
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,850
Ready?

9
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,850
What time is it?

10
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,450
12:30.

11
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,950
It all started back in New York
six weeks ago.

12
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,650
A truck loaded with stripped gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

13
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,150
The driver didn't see anyone,
but someone fucked up.

14
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,850
He heard a voice.
Sometimes that's all you need.

15
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,950
- Mr.McManus?
- Christ! Don't you fucking guys ever sleep?

16
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,250
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

17
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,550
Todd Hockney?

18
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,150
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

19
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,550
- Shit.
- Freeze!

20
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,950
Hold it!

21
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,750
Sure you brought enough guys?

22
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,650
It's quite simple:

23
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,550
A restaurant that changes with the taste
without losing the overall aesthetic.

24
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:45,850
In other words...

25
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,050
...the atmosphere will not
be painted on the walls.

26
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:54,250
- Let me give you an example--
- This I had to see for myself.

27
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,850
David.

28
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,150
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

29
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,750
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

30
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:07,850
Special Agent Kujan. US Customs.

31
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,750
These gentlemen
are from the New York Police Department.

32
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,750
You look good.
Better than I would have thought.

33
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,750
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

34
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:23,750
Mr.Keaton?

35
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,350
Will you excuse us for a moment?

36
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:32,350
We have some questions
to ask you downtown. You'll be a while.

37
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,450
No. Please, sit down.

38
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:38,950
This is a small problem.

39
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:43,150
Enjoy the meal. I'll talk to you later.

40
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,550
It didn't make sense that I'd be there.

41
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,350
These guys were hard-core hijackers...

42
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,350
...but there I was.

43
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:16,950
At that point, I wasn't scared.

44
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,950
I knew I hadn't done anything
they could do me for.

45
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,650
Besides, it was fun.

46
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:25,550
I got to make like I was notorious.

47
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,050
You all know the drill.

48
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:32,850
When your number is called, step forward
and repeat the phrase you've been given.

49
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,250
Number 1, step forward.

50
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,850
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

51
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,650
Number 2, step forward.

52
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,150
Gimme the fuckin' keys,
you fuckin' cocksucker motherfucker!

53
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:56,850
Knock it off. Get back.
Number 3, step forward.

54
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,350
- "Hand me the keys, you cocksucker."
- In English, please.

55
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,450
- Excuse me?
- In English.

56
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,250
Hand me the fuckin' keys, you cocksucker.
What the fuck?

57
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,250
Number 4, step forward.

58
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:21,250
It was bullshit.
The whole rap was a setup.

59
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,550
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

60
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,350
It was the cops' fault.

61
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:29,550
You don't put guys like that
into a room together.

62
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,750
Who knows what can happen?

63
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,250
"Hand me the keys
you fucking cocksucker."

64
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,450
This has really got to be embarrassing
for you guys.

65
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,750
They drilled us all night.

66
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,150
Someone was mad about that truck
hijacking and the cops had nothing.

67
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,450
They were hoping somebody would slip up
and give them something.

68
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:50,450
They knew we wouldn't fight,
they knew how to lean on us.

69
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,650
They've been doing it forever.
Our rights went out the window.

70
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,650
It was a violation. Disgraceful.

71
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,550
They went after McManus first.
Topnotch entry man.

72
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,050
What truck?

73
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,550
- The truck with the guns, fucko.
- "Fucko"?

74
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,050
He was a good guy. Crazy, though.

75
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,150
Wanna know what your pal
Fenster told us?

76
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,950
- Say who?
- McManus.

77
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,750
He told us another story.

78
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,550
Is that the one about
the hooker with the dysentery?

79
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,850
Fenster always worked with McManus.
He was a real tight-ass.

80
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,150
But when it came to the job,
he was right on. A smart man.

81
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,950
- What are you saying?
- I said he'll flip you.

82
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:31,050
- He'll what?
- Flip you. Flip you for real.

83
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:33,450
- I'm shaking. Come on.
- Okay.

84
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,550
- Answer my questions.
- Can you hear me in the back?

85
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,650
Hello?

86
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,850
I want my lawyer.

87
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,750
I'm gonna have
your fuckin' badge, cocksucker.

88
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:46,650
Todd Hockney: good with explosives.

89
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,750
Without a doubt, the one guy
who didn't give a fuck about anybody.

90
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,350
You guys don't have
a fuckin' leg to stand on.

91
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,650
You think so, tough guy?

92
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,250
I can put you in Queens
during the hijacking.

93
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,550
Really?

94
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,350
I live in Queens.

95
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,750
Did you put that
together yourself, Einstein?

96
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:05,450
You got a team of monkeys
working full time on this?

97
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,850
You know what happens
if you do another turn in the joint?

98
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,950
I fuck your father in the shower,
and have a snack.

99
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,350
- Are you gonna charge me, dickhead?
- I'll charge you when I'm ready.

100
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:19,150
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

101
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,250
But Keaton?

102
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,050
Keaton was the real prize for them
for obvious reasons.

103
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,850
It was your mistake, not mine.

104
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,550
Did you ever stop to ask me?

105
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:36,150
I've been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

106
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,050
I'm a businessman.

107
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,250
What's that? The restaurant business?

108
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,250
No. From now on you're in the
"getting fucked by us" business.

109
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:47,750
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

110
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,450
Like I said...

111
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,850
...it was your mistake...

112
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,450
...not mine.

113
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:56,250
You charge me with this shit...

114
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,150
...and I'll beat it.

115
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:01,150
Okay?

116
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,950
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

117
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,450
Really, somebody's got to do something
about this shit.

118
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:12,950
They put me in holding every five minutes.
So I did a little time.

119
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:17,450
Does that mean I get railed every time
a truck finds it's way gone?

120
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,850
Fuck 'em.

121
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,150
Fenster, will you relax?

122
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:25,650
- These guys don't have any probable cause.
- You fuckin' right. No PC.

123
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,250
You're goddamn right.
You do some time, never let you go.

124
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,750
They treat me like a criminal.

125
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,850
- I'll end up a criminal.
- You are a criminal.

126
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:38,850
Why'd you got to go and do that?

127
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:42,650
- I'm trying to make a point.
- Why don't you make your point?

128
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,950
You're making me tired all over.

129
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,150
Fuck it then.

130
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,050
- I heard you were dead.
- Yeah?

131
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,350
- You heard right.
- Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

132
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,850
- What's that all about?
- What's this?

133
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:00,750
Rumor has it Keaton's gone straight.
I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.

134
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:01,850
Who's that?

135
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,550
She's a heavyweight criminal
lawyer from uptown.

136
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,550
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

137
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,550
How 'bout it, Keaton?

138
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,450
You a lawyer's wife?

139
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,150
What kind of retainer you giving her?

140
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:18,750
Do your friend a favor...

141
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:21,150
...tell him to keep quiet.

142
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,650
Dean Keaton...

143
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,750
Gone clean?

144
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,850
Say it ain't so.

145
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:32,450
- Or was it you that hit that truck?
- Mac, forget him.

146
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,050
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

147
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,550
This whole thing was a shakedown.

148
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,350
- What makes you say that?
- How many times you been in a lineup?

149
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,750
It's always you and four dummies.

150
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,050
The PD are paying homeless guys
$10 a head half the time.

151
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,550
There's no way they'd line
five felons in the same row.

152
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:55,450
What's a voice lineup?
Public defender could get you out of that.

153
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,050
- Why the hell was I strip searched?
- It was the feds.

154
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,650
A truckload of guns gets snagged.

155
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:05,450
Customs comes down on NYPD
for answers. They come up with us.

156
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,850
- They're clutching at straws.
- I had a guy's finger up my ass.

157
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,250
Is it Friday already?

158
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,550
Yeah, lover boy.

159
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:16,850
You want a piece? Jump in. I'll love you.

160
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,650
So who in the goddamn piss hell
stole our fucking truck?

161
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:24,650
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

162
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,850
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, workingman?

163
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,650
Fuck who did it.
What I want to know is, who's the gimp?

164
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,050
- He's okay.
- Says you. How do I know that?

165
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,150
What about it, pretzel man?
What's your story?

166
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,550
His name is Verbal.

167
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,650
Verbal Kint.

168
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,150
- Verbal?
- Yeah.

169
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,350
Roger, really. People say I talk too much.

170
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,550
I was going to tell you to shut up.

171
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,350
- We met before, once or twice.
- In County. I was in for fraud.

172
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,650
You were in a lineup then, too.
What happened?

173
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:54,650
I walked. 90 days, suspended.

174
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,750
- So you did it.
- All right, now look...

175
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,850
...we've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

176
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,750
I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

177
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,550
Now, me and Fenster
heard about a little job.

178
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,450
Why don't you just calm down?

179
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,850
What do you care what he has to say?

180
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,850
I'm just talking here.

181
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,350
It seems to me like Mr.Hockney
wants to hear it...

182
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,350
...and I know Fenster's down.

183
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,950
What about you, guy?

184
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,750
I'm interested.

185
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,250
There. See?

186
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:33,650
I'd like to exercise my right
to free assembly.

187
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,650
Why don't you just shut up?

188
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,250
You're missing the point.

189
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:45,050
No.

190
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,050
You're missing the point.

191
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,750
I don't want to hear anything from you.

192
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,250
I don't care about your job.

193
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,250
And...

194
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,950
...I want nothing to do with any of you.

195
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,650
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

196
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,650
Dean Keaton...

197
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,850
...gone the high road.

198
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,550
What is the world coming to?

199
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,750
Fuck him.

200
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:27,150
And that was how it started:

201
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,650
Five of us brought in
on a trumped-up charge...

202
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,650
...to be leaned on by half-wits.

203
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,450
I really can't talk about it much here.

204
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:41,150
What the cops never figured out,
and what I know now...

205
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,450
...was that these men would never break,
never lie down.

206
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,450
Never bend over for anybody.

207
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,650
Anybody.

208
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,850
- Who are you?
- Agent Jack Baer, FBI.

209
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,150
- How many dead?
- 15 so far.

210
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:14,050
They're still pulling bodies
out of the water.

211
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,150
- Any survivors?
- Two.

212
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,050
One guy's in County hospital,
but he's in a coma.

213
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,150
The DA has a second guy,
a cripple from New York.

214
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,650
The chief wants this place sealed off.

215
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,550
If you have any questions, give him a call.

216
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,950
This is Dave Kujan.
I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.

217
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:09,250
If you need to reach me, contact Jeff Rabin
of the San Pedro Police Department...

218
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:12,150
...at extension 112. Have a nice day.

219
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,550
- Why can't I see him?
- I told you...

220
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:21,550
...the DA came down here
last night ready to arraign...

221
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,750
...even before they moved him to County.

222
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,150
Kint's lawyer shows up five minutes later...

223
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,750
...the DA comes out looking like
the bogeyman smacked him around.

224
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:32,950
They take his statement,
and they cut him a deal.

225
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:37,050
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Weapons, misdemeanor 2.

226
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,850
What is that?

227
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,050
I give the DA credit for getting that much,
you understand?

228
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,650
Excuse me, sir.

229
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,850
This whole thing has turned political.
The mayor was here last night.

230
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,250
The chief. This morning,
the governor called, okay?

231
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:57,550
I'm telling you, this guy is protected
from up on high by the Prince of Darkness.

232
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,050
- Take my word for it.
- When does he post bail?

233
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,350
- Maybe two hours, tops.
- I want to see him.

234
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,250
- No.
- I gotta see him.

235
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,950
- No. I can't--
- You gotta do this for me.

236
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,250
I came a long way for this.

237
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,450
Dave, please.

238
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,750
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk to you.

239
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,150
He's paranoid about being recorded.

240
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,750
- He knows the rooms are wired.
- I quit.

241
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:26,850
This won't be an interrogation,
just a friendly chat.

242
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:30,150
- He won't go into the interrogation room.
- Then someplace else.

243
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,350
Where?

244
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,650
No, no.

245
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,550
If this was a dope deal, where's the dope?
If it was a hit, who called it?

246
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,150
I'm sure you have a host of wild theories
to answer all these questions.

247
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,550
- You know what I think.
- That's crazy, and it doesn't even matter.

248
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,450
The guy's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

249
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,050
- He doesn't know what you want to know.
- I don't think he does, not exactly.

250
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:56,050
But there's a lot more to his story,
believe me.

251
00:19:56,450 --> 00:20:00,050
I wanna know why
27 men died on that pier...

252
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:04,450
...for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

253
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:08,050
And above all,
I want to be sure Dean Keaton's dead.

254
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:09,850
He's dead.

255
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,250
Come on. Two hours.
Just till he makes bail.

256
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:15,050
They're all dead.

257
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,450
I don't care how tough
you say Keaton was...

258
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,450
...nobody on that boat
could've come out alive.

259
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,650
- Is he talking?
- He regained consciousness an hour ago.

260
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,150
He spoke, not English, then he lapsed.

261
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,750
- Hungarian?
- That might have been it.

262
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:34,750
- Most of them were Hungarians.
- You gotta put this on.

263
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,450
Burn victims are very susceptible
to infection.

264
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:40,450
And, of course, there's no smoking.

265
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,750
Keep your mask up.
Please don't touch him.

266
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:53,950
Is he gonna die?

267
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,750
He's burned 60 percent of his body,
broken ribs--

268
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,450
Call security. Put a man on the door.

269
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,650
- Is he dangerous?
- Yes.

270
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,050
Do it.

271
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,050
Do it now.

272
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,550
Joel? Baer. Down at LA County.

273
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:14,650
Look, the guy they pulled out of the harbor
is Arkosh Kovash.

274
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,550
Yes, I'm sure.

275
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,750
No, he's all fucked up.

276
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,250
I can't hear you.

277
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,950
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

278
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,550
Yes.

279
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,450
No, not till I put a man on him.

280
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,950
Send me someone
who can speak Hungarian.

281
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:34,850
He's awake.
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

282
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,250
Keyser Soze.

283
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:39,850
- What?
- Keyser Soze!

284
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,950
No shit?

285
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:50,250
Call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice...

286
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:52,850
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

287
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,150
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan from Customs.

288
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,450
Nice to meet you.

289
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,050
He wants to ask you a few questions
before you go.

290
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,650
- What about?
- About a Dean Keaton, mostly.

291
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,350
I'd like to start at the lineup
back in New York.

292
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,750
- Can I get some coffee?
- In a while. Let's talk about the lineup.

293
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:49,250
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

294
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:51,650
Once I got so bad
my piss come out like snot.

295
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:54,750
- It was all thick and gooey--
- I'll get your fucking coffee.

296
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,350
Get me one, too, while you're at it.

297
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,450
That guy is tense.

298
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,350
Tension is a killer.

299
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:08,450
I used to be in a barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

300
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:11,450
The baritone was this guy
named Kip Diskin, big fat guy.

301
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,150
Like, orca fat.
He was so stressed in the morning--

302
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:18,250
- You know we're trying to help you.
- Sure, and I appreciate that.

303
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,450
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.
I like cops.

304
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,150
I would've liked to have been a fed,
but my CP--

305
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:28,150
You're not tellin' us everything.
I know you know something.

306
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,350
I told the DA everything I know.

307
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:34,650
I know you like Keaton.

308
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,850
- I know you think he's a good man.
- I know he was good.

309
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:40,350
He was a corrupt cop.

310
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,150
Sure. 15 years ago,
but he was a good thief.

311
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,850
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.

312
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,050
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

313
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:53,950
Are you trying to get a rise out of me?

314
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:57,850
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

315
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,450
May I have a cigarette?

316
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,550
- According to your statement--
- I need a light.

317
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:12,950
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

318
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,650
...run-of-the-mill--

319
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,450
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator...

320
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,750
...run-of-the-mill scams.

321
00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:27,650
It's been suppressed.
Anything in there is inadmissible.

322
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:31,050
I know. Sweet deal you have here.
Total immunity.

323
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:37,650
I do have the weapons charge.
I'm lookin' at six whole months hard time.

324
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,850
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

325
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,350
You know a religious guy
named John Paul?

326
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,550
- You know Ruby's in Attica?
- He didn't have my lawyer.

327
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:48,550
I know Ruby. He's big on respect.

328
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:51,050
He's a good friend of mine,
likes me very much.

329
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,150
I know your testimony is sealed.
Ruby's well connected.

330
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,950
He's got lots of friends inside
who do favors for him.

331
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,850
What would he say if he found out
you dropped his name to the DA?

332
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,650
- There's nothing there on Ruby.
- I'll be sure to mention that to him.

333
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:07,750
Know what I've learned on the job?
How to spot a murderer.

334
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,150
Say you arrest three guys
for the same killing.

335
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,750
Put them in jail overnight.

336
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:14,150
Next morning,
whoever's sleeping is your man.

337
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,850
If you're guilty, you know you're caught.
You let your guard down.

338
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,150
- You follow me?
- No.

339
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:21,850
Let me get to the point.

340
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,850
I'm smarter than you,
and I'm gonna find out what I wanna know.

341
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:30,250
I'll get it, whether you like it or not.

342
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,950
I'm not a rat.

343
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,550
Thanks.

344
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,650
When I was pickin' beans in Guatemala
we used to make fresh coffee.

345
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,750
Right off the trees, I mean. That was good.

346
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,650
- This is shit, but I'm in a police station.
- Can we get started again?

347
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,950
What happened after the lineup?

348
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:06,850
The desk sergeant was telling me
he couldn't release you.

349
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,150
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged.

350
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,550
Damn police.

351
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:16,750
I wanna have pictures taken of your face.

352
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:19,950
- I'll take them to the DA tomorrow.
- Forget about it.

353
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,750
I'll have this thing in front
of a grand jury by Monday.

354
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:24,750
I don't want to talk about it, okay?

355
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,550
What did Fortier and Renault say?

356
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:32,750
They asked for more time
to think about investing.

357
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:33,850
Damn it.

358
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,550
More time for what?

359
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,550
No matter how you cover my tracks
they're still gonna find out about me.

360
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,750
Give me some credit.

361
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,350
I got you this far.
Let's go to the grand jury.

362
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,550
- This isn't gonna stop if we don't--
- It's never going to stop, period.

363
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,350
By next week, every investor in the city
is gonna be walking away from us.

364
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,250
It's finished.

365
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,950
I'm finished.

366
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,750
Don't give up on me now.

367
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,850
It's never gonna stop.

368
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,450
I love you.

369
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,850
They ruined me in there tonight.

370
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,150
I love you.

371
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,950
Do you hear me?

372
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,250
What?

373
00:27:38,850 --> 00:27:40,150
All right.

374
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,250
Let's just go to my place.

375
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,550
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

376
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,250
Let's go.

377
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,450
Fenster and McManus
had a cagey proposition:

378
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,050
A fast-jump, high-risk, long money.

379
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,250
We all knew it could be done.

380
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,150
The way I figured,
to do it wrong meant killing.

381
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:21,550
To do it right took five men.

382
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:23,850
Five men meant Keaton.

383
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:27,050
Keaton took convincing.

384
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:31,750
New York's finest taxi service.

385
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,850
Bullshit.

386
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,950
Bullshit.

387
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:39,150
They don't operate anymore.

388
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,550
McManus has a friend in the 14th precinct.
They're coming out for one job, Thursday.

389
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:46,550
They're pickin' up a guy
smuggling emeralds from South America.

390
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,450
McManus already has a fence set up.

391
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,450
- A fence? Who?
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.

392
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,450
- I never heard of him.
- You have to come.

393
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,050
- What's it to you whether I do it or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

394
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,650
They won't take me unless you go.

395
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,750
Look at me. I need this.

396
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:08,050
You're telling me you don't need this?
Is this your place?

397
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,950
I'm not knocking you. You got
a good scam going with this lawyer.

398
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:17,850
Sorry.

399
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:20,750
It's okay.

400
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,650
You say it's the real thing? That's cool.

401
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,450
You okay?

402
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,550
I was out of line.

403
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,250
But they're never gonna stop with us.
You know that.

404
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,050
As clean as you get,
they'll never let you go now.

405
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:41,150
This way, we hit the cops where it hurts,
and we get well in the meantime.

406
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,650
You sure you're okay?

407
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,650
I'll be all right.

408
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:04,550
Look, I...

409
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,750
- ...sometimes get--
- Forget it.

410
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:13,550
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

411
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,750
So...

412
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,350
...how do they wanna do it?

413
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,550
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

414
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,350
Fenster? Hockney?

415
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,250
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

416
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,750
I got a way to do it without killing anyone.

417
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:47,050
But like I say,
they won't let me in without you.

418
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,550
$3 million?

419
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:09,950
Maybe more.

420
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:15,950
No killing.

421
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,450
Not if we do it my way.

422
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,650
New York's finest taxi service
was not your normal taxi service.

423
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:00,650
It was a ring of corrupt cops in the NYPD
that ran a high-profit racket...

424
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:03,250
...driving smugglers and drug dealers
all over the city.

425
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,950
For $300 a mile,
you got your own blue and white...

426
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:09,050
...and a police escort.
They even had their own business cards.

427
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,350
After a while, somebody started asking
questions, and the taxi service shut down.

428
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:17,050
Ever since then, Internal Affairs
has been waiting to catch them in the act.

429
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,750
That's where we came in.

430
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,250
- So, how was the flight?
- Fuckin' great.

431
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,550
Will this get me to Staten Island?

432
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,050
Are you kiddin' me?
This will get you to Cape Cod.

433
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:33,050
McManus came to us with the job.
Fenster got the vans.

434
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,750
Hockney supplied the hardware.

435
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,450
I came through with
how to do it so no one got killed.

436
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:41,150
But Keaton?
Keaton put on the finishing touch.

437
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,850
A little "fuck you" from the five
of us to the NYPD.

438
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:49,350
Watch this.

439
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,550
Careful.

440
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,550
Come on, asshole!

441
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,250
Holy shit!

442
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:00,350
- Don't move, you fucker!
- Drop it now, motherfucker!

443
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:02,550
Drop the fuckin' gun! Drop it!

444
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:04,650
Don't fuckin' touch a fuckin' thing.

445
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,350
- What do you guys want?
- Put your fuckin' thing away.

446
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,450
We're cops! Stupid assholes!

447
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:12,150
- Watch the glass!
- Don't fuckin' move, motherfucker!

448
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,550
- You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?
- Shut up!

449
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,550
Fuck.

450
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:24,550
'Afternoon, my little pork chops.
Give me the shit.

451
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,250
- Don't move!
- Give him the shit!

452
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,350
Give him the fuckin' thing!

453
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:30,250
Give him the fuckin' shit, man!

454
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,650
Hurry up! Come on!

455
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,950
- Now the money!
- There's no money.

456
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:38,050
- Give me the money now!
- There's no fuckin' money.

457
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,750
Give him the fuckin' money!

458
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:42,450
- Do it! Give him the money!
- Give me the money!

459
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:44,950
- Give him the money!
- Hurry up!

460
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,950
You know who the fuck I am?

461
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,850
You people know
who the fuck I am? Fuck!

462
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,250
We do now, jerk-off.

463
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,350
Cocksucker.

464
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,150
Wait a minute. What's that?

465
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,650
What the fuck?

466
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,550
Holy shit!

467
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,250
Go!

468
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:26,150
Keaton made an anonymous phone call.

469
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,850
The press was on the scene
before the police were.

470
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,350
Strausz and Rizzi
were indicted three days later.

471
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,250
Within a few weeks,
50 more cops went down with them.

472
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:38,250
Everybody got it right in the ass,
from the chief on down.

473
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,950
It was beautiful.

474
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,650
I owe you $2.50.

475
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,650
Dr.Keaton.

476
00:34:55,450 --> 00:34:58,950
- There's more here than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

477
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,950
Redfoot never comes to see me.
I always go to see him.

478
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,850
In California?

479
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,750
Yes, Verbal, in California. Fenster and I--

480
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:12,850
Wait, hold the fuckin' phone.
You and Fenster? No.

481
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,150
- You fuckin' kiddin' me?
- So then, who's gonna go?

482
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:19,250
We all go.

483
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,350
What's your fuckin' problem, man?

484
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:27,050
My problem, is you and Fenster
honeymooning in California...

485
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,150
...while the rest of us are sittin' here
holding our dicks.

486
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,850
The job's over.

487
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:33,650
Cool it.

488
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,950
LA's a good place to lay low for a while.

489
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,050
You wanna dance?

490
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,850
Ladies.

491
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,650
I would like to propose a toast.

492
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,550
There you go.

493
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,650
To Mr.Verbal...

494
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:10,350
...the man with the plan.

495
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,050
We're gonna miss the flight.

496
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,250
Don't do this.
Send her a note. Something.

497
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,850
I said we'll make it.

498
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,850
We're gonna miss the plane.

499
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,750
She'll understand.

500
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,350
That's heartwarming. Really.

501
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,250
I'm weepy.

502
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,450
You wanna wait outside?

503
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:45,850
You guys wanted to know what happened.
I'm telling you.

504
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:47,350
Come on, Verbal.

505
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,450
Who do you think you're talkin' to?
You expect me to believe that he retired?

506
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,850
For a woman?

507
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:59,350
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

508
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:02,050
- He loved her.
- Sure.

509
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,550
I'm supposed to believe that hitting
the taxi service wasn't his idea.

510
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:09,450
- It was all Fenster and McManus.
- Keaton was a cop for four years.

511
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,350
Who else would know better?

512
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:14,250
- That job had his name on it.
- Edie had him turned around.

513
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,550
Let me tell you something.

514
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,250
I know Dean Keaton.

515
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:21,150
I've been investigating him
for the past three years.

516
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:23,750
The guy I know
was a cold-blooded bastard.

517
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:28,350
IAD indicted him on three counts of
murder before he was kicked off the force.

518
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,750
Don't sell me the hooker
with a heart of gold.

519
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,350
You got him all wrong.

520
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:34,650
Do I?

521
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:39,550
Dean Keaton was under indictment
seven times while he was on the force.

522
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,150
In every case,
witnesses either reversed their testimony...

523
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:46,150
...or died before they could testify.

524
00:38:46,850 --> 00:38:51,250
When they finally did nail him for fraud,
he spent five years in Sing Sing.

525
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:53,350
He killed three prisoners inside.

526
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:56,150
Of course, I can't prove this...

527
00:38:57,350 --> 00:39:00,050
...but I can't prove the best part either.

528
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:03,050
Dean Keaton was dead.

529
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:05,350
Did you know that?

530
00:39:05,650 --> 00:39:09,350
He died in a fire two years ago,
during an investigation into the murder...

531
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:12,550
...of a witness who was going
to testify against him.

532
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,650
Two people saw Dean Keaton
walk into a warehouse he owned...

533
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:17,550
...just before it blew up.

534
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:21,050
They said he went in
to check a leaking gas main.

535
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,850
It blew up and took all
of Dean Keaton with it.

536
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:31,050
Within three months of the explosion,
the two witnesses, they were dead.

537
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:33,550
One killed himself in his car.

538
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,650
The other fell down an open elevator shaft.

539
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,850
Let's get this show on the road.

540
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,650
This is not what we discussed.
There are too many--

541
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,550
I promise we'll be out
before he blows his porch light.

542
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:50,050
- I have a noon meeting.
- Five minutes.

543
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,950
Everyone calm down, all right?

544
00:39:52,050 --> 00:39:55,450
I want you to ask this man
about the shootout in the harbor.

545
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:10,150
- He says they were buying--
- Dope. We know.

546
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:18,850
He doesn't know
what they were buying, but not dope.

547
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,250
- People.
- What?

548
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,950
He needs guarantees...

549
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,250
- What is he talking about, guarantees?
- He says his life is in danger.

550
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,350
He saw the Devil.

551
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,350
Looked him in the eye.

552
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,050
- I'm on my way.
- No, wait a minute.

553
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:44,650
Ask him to tell him what he told me...

554
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:47,150
...about the Devil.

555
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:49,150
Who's the Devil?

556
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:55,750
Keyser Soze.

557
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,050
Keyser Soze?

558
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:04,950
He was in the harbor, killing many men.

559
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:07,550
He saw Keyser Soze?

560
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:16,350
- He saw his face.
- All right.

561
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,350
Tell him to tell her what he looks like.

562
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,250
Describe him.

563
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,350
Six weeks ago,
I get an anonymous phone call...

564
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:34,450
...telling me I can find Keaton
eating at Mondino's, and there he is.

565
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,250
Because he never profited
from his alleged death...

566
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,850
...and we convicted someone else
of the murder we tried to pin on him...

567
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,950
...we had to let him go.

568
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:47,750
He was dead just long enough
for the murder rap to blow over.

569
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:49,550
And then he had lunch.

570
00:41:50,050 --> 00:41:51,950
I don't know about that.

571
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,750
I don't think you do,
but you say you saw Keaton die.

572
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:59,550
I think you're covering his ass,
and he's still out there.

573
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,950
I think he's behind
that circus at the harbor.

574
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:05,550
My bet is he's using you because
you're stupid and think he's your friend.

575
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,850
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

576
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,150
I wanna be sure
before I go back to New York.

577
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,150
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

578
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:16,050
What lawyer?

579
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:17,950
What lawyer?

580
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,750
Back when I was in
that barbershop quartet--

581
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:23,250
You don't think I know you held out
on the DA?

582
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,950
What did you leave out?

583
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,350
I could be on the phone
to Ruby in 10 minutes.

584
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:30,050
- The DA gave me immunity.
- Not from me.

585
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:32,650
You get no immunity from me,
you piece of shit.

586
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:36,250
Every criminal I have put in prison,
every cop that owes me a favor...

587
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,950
...every creep and scumbag
that walks the street...

588
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,650
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.
You talk to me...

589
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,250
...or that precious immunity
they grant you...

590
00:42:44,350 --> 00:42:48,650
...won't be worth the paper the contract
put out on your life is printed on.

591
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,450
There was a lawyer.

592
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,150
Kobayashi.

593
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:00,550
- Is he the one that killed Keaton?
- No, but I'm sure Keaton is dead.

594
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,950
Convince me.

595
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,850
Tell me every last detail.

596
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:28,650
We arrived in Los Angeles
and met McManus' fence, Redfoot.

597
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:33,250
He had a good reputation.
Seemed like a good guy.

598
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,550
- Still, we should have known better.
- How you doing?

599
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:39,650
- Good. You?
- Not bad. Can't complain.

600
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,450
How's it going, Fenster?

601
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:45,450
Don't need to open it, right?

602
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,050
You must be Keaton.

603
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,950
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

604
00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:00,150
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.
- Verbal, the man with the plan.

605
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:02,550
You interested in more work?

606
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,350
- We're always looking for extra work.
- We're on vacation.

607
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:09,350
That's too bad.

608
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,950
I got a ton of work and no good people.

609
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:14,350
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job?

610
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,450
There's this jeweler
out of Texas named Saul.

611
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,650
He rents a suite in some downtown hotel.

612
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,350
He does free appraisals.
Sometimes he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

613
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,150
The word is,
he carries around a lot of cash.

614
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:31,050
So I figure, I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

615
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:33,850
- Simple.
- What about security?

616
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,250
A couple of bodyguards.
Nothing you couldn't handle.

617
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:39,250
Give me time to check it out?

618
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,750
I expect nothing less from you, man.

619
00:44:43,150 --> 00:44:45,150
Good to see you. We'll call you.

620
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,650
Enjoy LA. Get yourself laid.

621
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:57,050
A friend in New York tells me
that you knew Spook Hollis.

622
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,150
The way I hear it,
you did time with ol' Spook.

623
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,050
A good man, wasn't he?

624
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,450
I used to run dope for him.

625
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:08,250
Too bad he got shivved.

626
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,450
I shivved him.

627
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:17,550
Better you hear it from me now
than from somebody else later.

628
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,650
I appreciate that.

629
00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:23,550
But just out of curiosity...

630
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,750
...was it business or personal?

631
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,650
A bit of both.

632
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,950
Like I said...

633
00:45:34,250 --> 00:45:37,150
...you give me a call if you're interested.

634
00:45:41,250 --> 00:45:43,050
Is there a problem?

635
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:45,950
One job.

636
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,050
That was the deal.

637
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,550
One job?

638
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:58,850
One job?

639
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,450
That's a good one.

640
00:46:04,750 --> 00:46:08,250
Keaton fought it as best he could,
but a man can't change what he is.

641
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,550
He can convince anyone he's someone else,
but never himself.

642
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:15,250
It took one day with McManus nagging,
and we went back to work.

643
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,450
I get out of my car,
and the thing is wrecked.

644
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:36,050
I look in the backseat of the other car,
and this woman's totally naked.

645
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,250
- I'm laughin' so hard I can't breathe.
- Get in the car, Saul.

646
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:42,150
- Freeze, motherfucker!
- Stay right there!

647
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:45,950
There's a second one here, somewhere.

648
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,950
Gimme the case. Give me the fuckin' case!

649
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:02,550
Give me the fuckin' case.
I'm tellin' you for the last time.

650
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,550
Give me the fuckin' case!

651
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,550
- Come on!
- Don't move!

652
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,650
Hand over the case.

653
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:51,850
Hand over the fuckin' case.

654
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,450
Come on, let's go!

655
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:20,650
- Come on!
- Bad day. Fuck it.

656
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:22,950
Let's go!

657
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:48,250
Fuck.

658
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:55,050
- Looks like a lot of china to me.
- Shit.

659
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:01,850
Guys, come on.

660
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,650
- What are you doin'?
- I'm gonna kill him.

661
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,850
We did it your way, now we'll do it mine.

662
00:49:07,950 --> 00:49:10,150
- You gonna kill him?
- I'll deal with him.

663
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,050
- You'd better, or I'm gonna.
- Shut up.

664
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:22,850
What am I supposed to do with that?

665
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:26,350
Feed it to the gimp. Ease his pain.
I don't know what that is.

666
00:49:26,350 --> 00:49:28,450
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

667
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:30,750
I got thrown this job by some lawyer.

668
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:31,850
Who?

669
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:34,150
I don't know. Some limey.

670
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,950
He's a middleman for somebody.
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

671
00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:40,250
- You're fuckin' full of shit!
- Fuck you.

672
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:42,050
- Fuck you.
- Listen to me.

673
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,450
We wanna meet him, okay?

674
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,250
That's funny.

675
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,650
He called me last night.
He says he wants to meet you guys.

676
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:53,250
Okay, we'll meet him.

677
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,550
- I'll call you.
- Good. Let's go.

678
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,950
I don't like it. Wait a minute.
One more thing, tough guy:

679
00:49:59,450 --> 00:50:02,250
Any more surprises, and I'm gonna kill you.

680
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:06,650
You're such a tough guy.
But do me a favor, all right?

681
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,850
Get the fuck off my dick.

682
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,750
No!

683
00:50:11,850 --> 00:50:13,650
Put a leash on that puppy.

684
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:19,050
It's an awful shame
about Saul gettin' whacked.

685
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,850
Cops'll be lookin' for the guys who did it.

686
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:25,550
Sooner or later,
they're gonna come around askin' me.

687
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:30,250
You have a sweet night, ladies.

688
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,350
Fuck you.

689
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:44,550
- So this lawyer--
- Kobayashi.

690
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:47,650
- Came from Redfoot.
- Right.

691
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:50,850
And why leave this out
when you talked to the DA?

692
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,950
Dave, someone to see you.

693
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:00,450
I've been looking all over for you.

694
00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:04,150
You still after that coke that took a walk
out of that bloodbath yesterday?

695
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,050
You can stop looking. There was no coke.

696
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,750
I've been in LA County talking to a guy
they pulled out of a drainpipe...

697
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,650
...yesterday after the shootout.

698
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,850
He came to this morning,
he started talking.

699
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:18,250
He's part of a Hungarian mob.
They dealt with gwats from Argentina.

700
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:20,850
He says it was definitely not a dope deal.

701
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:24,250
- But there were--
- We know. But he says no on the dope.

702
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:27,850
This Hungarian tells me they were
pulling stumps for Turkey the next day.

703
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:31,450
They had no time for that kind of product,
and no means to move it.

704
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:33,550
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

705
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:36,850
No one doing the deal knew
except for a few key people.

706
00:51:36,950 --> 00:51:39,250
They were all very hush about it, he says.

707
00:51:39,450 --> 00:51:43,650
- Whatever it was, it was very sensitive.
- I don't get it.

708
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:46,050
You got the cripple in there
from New York?

709
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:47,650
Did he mention Keyser Soze?

710
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:49,250
Who?

711
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:51,750
Just bear with me here.

712
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:55,950
- Who's Keyser Soze?
- Fuck!

713
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:00,150
We've been goin' over this
for an hour and a half.

714
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:04,450
What we need to do is find Redfoot
and get the hell out of here now.

715
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:06,550
What we need to do is think.

716
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:08,250
Think back.

717
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:12,150
Somebody with power...

718
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:15,850
...somebody capable of tracking us
from New York to LA.

719
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:18,950
- What the hell are we doing here?
- We're waiting.

720
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,450
- Sit down.
- No. I'm hot, and I'm fuckin' bored.

721
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:25,250
Mr.Hockney, do stay.

722
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:27,350
Mr.Keaton.

723
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,050
Mr.Fenster I recognize
from his mug shots...

724
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,950
...as well as Mr.McManus.

725
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:37,050
I can only assume that you are Mr.Kint,
the gentleman who disposed of Saul Berg.

726
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,850
My employer sends his gratitude,
a most unexpected benefit.

727
00:52:42,050 --> 00:52:43,750
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

728
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:48,650
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

729
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:51,850
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services.

730
00:52:53,950 --> 00:52:57,550
One job, one day's work. Very dangerous.

731
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:01,150
He does not expect all of you to live.
But those of you who do...

732
00:53:01,350 --> 00:53:05,350
...will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

733
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,150
Who's your boss?

734
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,050
I work for Keyser Soze.

735
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:23,650
Who's Keyser Soze?

736
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,050
Judging by the sudden change in mood...

737
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,150
...I feel sure the rest
of your associates can tell you.

738
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:32,250
I come with an offer
directly from Mr.Soze.

739
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:36,250
- An order, actually.
- What do you mean, "an order"?

740
00:53:36,450 --> 00:53:41,450
In 1981, you participated in the hijacking
of a truck in Buffalo, New York.

741
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:45,650
The cargo was raw steel,
steel which belonged to Mr.Soze...

742
00:53:45,750 --> 00:53:49,850
...and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

743
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:53,150
A most profitable violation
of UN Regulations.

744
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,350
You had no way of knowing this...

745
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:58,550
...because the fellow shipping the steel
was working for Soze...

746
00:53:58,650 --> 00:54:00,250
...without his knowledge.

747
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:03,250
Earlier this year,
Mr.Fenster and Mr.McManus...

748
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:07,050
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight
out of Newark airport.

749
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:11,450
The plane was carrying gold and platinum
wiring also set for Pakistan.

750
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:15,550
Two months ago,
Mr.Hockney stole a truck...

751
00:54:15,550 --> 00:54:18,150
...carrying gun parts through Queens.

752
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,850
Gun parts which were set to be destroyed
by the state of New York.

753
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,850
They were to be lost in a way station
and rerouted to Belfast.

754
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:28,950
Again, Mr.Soze using pawns
who had no knowledge.

755
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:31,450
Which brings us to Mr.Kint.

756
00:54:32,650 --> 00:54:35,150
Nine months ago, one of Mr.Soze's...

757
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:39,850
...less than intelligent couriers was taken
in a complicated confidence scam...

758
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:41,950
...by a cripple.

759
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:44,650
He was relieved of $62,000.

760
00:54:45,450 --> 00:54:48,350
Now, it has taken us
some time to find you.

761
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:52,650
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

762
00:54:52,850 --> 00:54:54,150
You set up the lineup.

763
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,550
Yes. You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

764
00:54:57,550 --> 00:55:00,450
It seems Mr.Keaton's attorney,
Miss Finneran...

765
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:04,350
...was a little too effective
in expediting his release.

766
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,550
Holding the rest of you
became a moot point.

767
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:09,550
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

768
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,350
Mr.Soze rarely works
with the same people for long...

769
00:55:12,450 --> 00:55:15,250
...and they never know
who they're working for.

770
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:18,250
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

771
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,250
So, why are you telling us?

772
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:25,850
Because you have stolen from Mr.Soze,
Mr.Fenster.

773
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:27,150
All of you.

774
00:55:27,250 --> 00:55:30,850
That you did not know it
is the only reason you're still alive.

775
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:35,150
He feels you owe him.
You will repay your debt.

776
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:39,450
Fuck the debt, and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Soze?

777
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:42,450
I don't think that is very relevant.

778
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:45,850
All five of you are responsible
for the murder of Saul Berg...

779
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:47,250
...and his bodyguards.

780
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,050
Mr.Redfoot can testify
to your involvement.

781
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:52,050
We can see to it that he will.

782
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:55,250
- What's your point?
- The offer is this, gentlemen:

783
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,650
Mr.Soze's primary interest...

784
00:55:58,050 --> 00:55:59,450
...is narcotics.

785
00:55:59,750 --> 00:56:02,350
He has been competing, shall we say...

786
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:04,850
...with a group of Argentineans
for several years.

787
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:07,950
Competing with Mr.Soze has taken its toll.

788
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:11,350
These Argentineans
are negotiating the sale...

789
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:15,250
...of $91 million in cocaine
in three days time.

790
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:18,450
Needless to say,
this purchase will revitalize...

791
00:56:18,450 --> 00:56:21,250
...the diminishing strength
of their organization.

792
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:25,350
Mr.Soze would like you to stop the deal.

793
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:29,250
If you choose,
you may wait until after the buy.

794
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:31,950
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

795
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:37,650
Mr.Soze would like you to get to the boat
and destroy the cocaine onboard.

796
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:42,250
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr.Soze.

797
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:48,250
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't kill you right now.

798
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,750
A gift from Mr.Soze.

799
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:57,750
Good day, gentlemen.

800
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:10,150
They got my whole life in here,
everything I've done since I was 18.

801
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,550
They fuckin' know everything.

802
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,450
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

803
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:30,950
No.

804
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:35,450
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.

805
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,650
Who's that guy who used
to talk about Soze in New York?

806
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:44,450
- Bricks Marlin.
- He did jobs for him, indirect stuff.

807
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:48,850
He said he always made five times
more money on it than the job was worth.

808
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:51,150
This guy's a pipe dream.

809
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:53,450
Kobayashi's using him
for window dressing.

810
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:55,550
I don't know. This is bad.

811
00:58:56,050 --> 00:58:59,850
It's bullshit. This guy could be LAPD.
It's a fuckin' setup.

812
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:03,650
The way I hear it,
Soze's some kind of butcher.

813
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:08,250
- A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.
- There is no Keyser Soze!

814
00:59:11,050 --> 00:59:12,650
Who is Keyser Soze?

815
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:17,650
He's supposed to be Turkish.
Some say his father was German.

816
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,750
Nobody ever believed he was real.

817
00:59:20,050 --> 00:59:23,150
Nobody knew him or saw anybody
that ever worked directly for him.

818
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:26,350
To hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could have worked for Soze.

819
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:29,550
You never knew. That was his power.

820
00:59:30,350 --> 00:59:33,250
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...

821
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,650
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

822
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:40,750
One story the guys told me,
the story I believe...

823
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:42,550
...was from his days in Turkey.

824
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,550
There was a gang of Hungarians
that wanted their own mob.

825
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:49,050
They realized that to be in power,
you didn't need guns...

826
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:50,650
...or money or even numbers.

827
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:54,150
You just needed the will
to do what the other guy wouldn't.

828
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:57,950
After a while they come into power,
and then they come after Soze.

829
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:01,350
He was small-time then.
Just running dope, they say.

830
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:05,050
They come to his home...

831
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:08,050
...in the afternoon looking for his business.

832
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:12,350
They find his wife and kids in the house,
and decide to wait for Soze.

833
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:32,450
He comes home to find his wife raped
and children screaming.

834
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,850
The Hungarians knew Soze was tough,
not to be trifled with.

835
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,650
They let him know they meant business.

836
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:40,350
No!

837
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:46,650
They tell him they want his territory,
all his business.

838
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:50,550
Soze looks over the faces of his family.

839
01:00:52,450 --> 01:00:55,950
Then he showed these men
of will what will really was.

840
01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:18,450
He tells them he would
rather see his family dead...

841
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:21,150
...than live another day after this.

842
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:24,750
He lets the last Hungarian go...

843
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:28,950
...waits until his family is in the ground,
and goes after the rest of the mob.

844
01:01:29,350 --> 01:01:31,950
He kills their kids, he kills their wives...

845
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,350
...he kills their parents and their friends.

846
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:37,050
He burns down the houses they live in...

847
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,950
...and the stores they work in.

848
01:01:40,450 --> 01:01:44,050
He kills people that owe them money.
And like that...

849
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:47,150
...he's gone, underground.

850
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:49,850
Nobody's ever seen him since.
He becomes a myth.

851
01:01:49,850 --> 01:01:53,050
A spook story that criminals
tell their kids at night.

852
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:56,250
"Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Soze will get you."

853
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:59,150
No one ever really believes.

854
01:01:59,350 --> 01:02:01,450
Do you believe in him?

855
01:02:03,950 --> 01:02:05,650
Keaton always said:

856
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:09,350
"I don't believe in God,
but I'm afraid of him."

857
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:13,250
I believe in God.

858
01:02:13,550 --> 01:02:17,650
And the only thing that scares me
is Keyser Soze.

859
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:26,550
You give any weight to this?

860
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,050
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser
from Justice.

861
01:02:29,150 --> 01:02:32,750
He's got a file on Soze in DC.
It's been a hobby of his for a while.

862
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,250
A lot of guys equate him to that reporter
on The Incredible Hulk.

863
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:42,750
You've heard of him?

864
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:44,650
Where? On the street?

865
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:47,450
A few times. You know, outside stuff.

866
01:02:47,750 --> 01:02:51,750
Someone working for a guy who worked
for a guy who got money from Soze.

867
01:02:51,850 --> 01:02:53,450
Shit like that.

868
01:02:54,250 --> 01:02:56,550
It could be an old badge. A hex sign.

869
01:02:56,550 --> 01:02:59,650
Keep people from fucking with you
when a name meant something.

870
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:01,650
- But you're here.
- Shit, yeah.

871
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:06,550
This guy's trying to walk out of a hospital
because he's so afraid of Soze.

872
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:08,950
I'll run it up the flagpole.

873
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,850
I came clean. I told it like it happened.

874
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:14,450
So what about how I got there?

875
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:17,750
It's so full of holes, the DA would've
told me to forget amnesty.

876
01:03:17,850 --> 01:03:20,050
You got what you wanted out of me.
Big deal.

877
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:22,950
- That's why you never told the DA?
- You tell me.

878
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:26,350
If I told you the Loch Ness monster
hired me, what would you say?

879
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:28,750
Turn state's evidence.
We'll put you on the stand.

880
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,250
I've got immunity.
What can you possibly offer me?

881
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,950
If there really is a Keyser Soze,
he's gonna come lookin' for you.

882
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:36,750
Where's your head?

883
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,150
Where do you think the pressure is?

884
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:42,350
Keyser Soze, or whatever you call him,
knows where I am right now.

885
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:46,650
He has the burner on your ass to let me go
so he can scoop me up 10 minutes later.

886
01:03:46,950 --> 01:03:48,950
Immunity was just a deal
with you assholes.

887
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:50,950
I got a new problem when I post bail.

888
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:53,450
Why play into his hands?
We can protect you.

889
01:03:54,550 --> 01:03:57,850
Thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far.
Extortion, coercion.

890
01:03:57,950 --> 01:04:00,050
Pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker.

891
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:03,450
The same fuckers that rounded us up
are now bailing me out?

892
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:05,250
Fuck you.

893
01:04:07,150 --> 01:04:09,550
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

894
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:12,750
You think a guy like that
comes this close to getting caught...

895
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:14,350
...and sticks his head out?

896
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:17,250
If he comes up for anything,
it'll be to get rid of me.

897
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:19,150
After that...

898
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:22,550
...my guess is you'll never hear
from him again.

899
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:46,250
What happened next?

900
01:04:46,450 --> 01:04:49,150
We woke up the next morning
and Fenster was gone.

901
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,750
He couldn't handle the idea
of slumming for Soze.

902
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:53,950
He left us a note wishing us good luck...

903
01:04:54,050 --> 01:04:56,750
...and took a chunk of the money
we'd scraped together.

904
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:57,950
Then what?

905
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,650
McManus was furious.

906
01:04:59,750 --> 01:05:03,950
He talked about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out. All sorts of shit.

907
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,850
That night, we got the call.

908
01:05:07,250 --> 01:05:08,450
What call?

909
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:11,050
Kobayashi told us where
we could find Fenster.

910
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,550
Let's get the fuck out of here.

911
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:24,650
We gotta bury him.

912
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:26,150
With what?

913
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:28,150
With our hands.

914
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:39,450
This is nuts.

915
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:41,650
It's dry fucking sand.

916
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,250
When he rots the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

917
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,350
- Dig, you fuck.
- What are we gonna do?

918
01:05:47,450 --> 01:05:49,350
This fuckin' guy is gonna kill us.

919
01:05:49,450 --> 01:05:53,250
I don't know about you, peg leg,
but I can run. I got no problem with that.

920
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:57,350
Kobayashi doesn't seem
to have a problem with it either.

921
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:01,050
You run, and we're gonna be
diggin' a hole for you.

922
01:06:01,150 --> 01:06:02,650
You got that?

923
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,650
This ain't my boy we're burying.
I don't owe anybody!

924
01:06:07,550 --> 01:06:11,150
- So fuck you.
- He was my partner for five years.

925
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,850
We did more jobs and I saw more money
than you can ever count.

926
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:16,350
So fuck you!

927
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:20,050
- 'Cause now it's payback!
- It's not payback!

928
01:06:22,950 --> 01:06:24,350
It's precaution.

929
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:27,750
You want payback? You wanna run?
I don't care.

930
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,950
I'm not doin' this for Fenster.

931
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,650
I'm not doin' it for you.

932
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:39,050
I'm doin' this for me.

933
01:06:40,850 --> 01:06:42,750
I'm gonna finish this thing.

934
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:46,650
This Kobayashi bastard
is not gonna stand on me.

935
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,950
After they killed Fenster,
nobody would run?

936
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:14,050
- I wanted to. I thought we could make it.
- Why didn't you say anything?

937
01:07:14,050 --> 01:07:16,750
Believe me, I tried,
but Keaton wouldn't have it.

938
01:07:16,750 --> 01:07:18,850
It was too far-fetched for him.

939
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:21,150
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.

940
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:24,150
To a cop, the explanation
is never that complicated.

941
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:25,850
It's always simple.

942
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:28,550
There's no mystery to the street,
no arch-criminal.

943
01:07:28,550 --> 01:07:32,350
You got a body and think
his brother did it, you're probably right.

944
01:07:32,450 --> 01:07:33,950
Nobody argued with Keaton.

945
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,650
They just set their minds
to whacking Kobayashi.

946
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:47,950
They're coming up.

947
01:07:49,750 --> 01:07:53,850
- Did you hear me? He's coming up.
- He's on his way down.

948
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:51,950
Don't move.

949
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:54,350
Press 20. Do it now.

950
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:15,750
Move.

951
01:09:19,150 --> 01:09:22,050
- The answer is "no."
- Mr.Soze will be most--

952
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:24,350
Listen, cocksucker,
there is no Keyser Soze.

953
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:26,950
Mention his name again,
I'll kill you right now.

954
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:30,850
A strange threat. I assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

955
01:09:36,350 --> 01:09:38,750
We know that you can get to us...

956
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:42,450
...but now you know
that we can get to you.

957
01:09:43,050 --> 01:09:46,050
I'm giving you one last
chance to call this off.

958
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:49,550
My employer has made up his mind.

959
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:52,750
- He does not change it.
- Neither do we.

960
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:55,750
You got Fenster,
but you won't be able to get all of us.

961
01:09:55,850 --> 01:09:58,150
Not before one of us gets through to you.

962
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:01,350
I believe you. I most sincerely do.

963
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:04,950
You would not have been chosen
were you not so suitable.

964
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:08,950
But I cannot make this decision.
Whatever you threaten me with is...

965
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:11,850
...ludicrous in comparison
to what will be done to me...

966
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:14,550
...if I do not carry out my orders in full.

967
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:24,550
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

968
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,450
I just wanted you to know that.

969
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:31,350
I'm so sorry.

970
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:34,350
I implore you, believe me...

971
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,750
...Mr.Soze is very real...

972
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:39,650
- ...and very determined.
- We'll see.

973
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:50,450
Before you do me in...

974
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:54,850
...you will let me finish my business
with Miss Finneran first, won't you?

975
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:01,350
What did you say?

976
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:04,050
Edie Finneran.

977
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:06,350
She's upstairs in my office...

978
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:09,150
...for an extradition deposition.

979
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:12,950
I requested she be
put on the case personally.

980
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:14,850
She flew in yesterday.

981
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:18,150
No matter.

982
01:11:18,650 --> 01:11:20,550
Kill away.

983
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:26,850
You're lying.

984
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:28,450
Am I?

985
01:11:45,950 --> 01:11:49,550
Miss Finneran's escort
while she's here in Los Angeles.

986
01:11:49,650 --> 01:11:51,250
Never leaves her for a moment.

987
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:54,150
I thought you'd be glad to know
she's in good hands.

988
01:11:58,950 --> 01:12:01,750
Get some rest.
The boat will be ready for you on Friday.

989
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:04,450
If I see you or any
of your friends before then...

990
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:09,350
...Miss Finneran will be the victim of
a most gruesome violation before she dies.

991
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:11,950
As indeed will your father, Mr.Hockney...

992
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:15,350
...and your Uncle Randall in Arizona,
Mr.Kint.

993
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:19,750
I might only castrate
Mr.McManus' nephew, David.

994
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:24,650
Do I make myself clear?

995
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:27,550
We will take care
of the two bodies downstairs.

996
01:12:27,650 --> 01:12:29,850
We'll add them to the cost of Mr.Fenster.

997
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,950
If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.

998
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:13,250
It's a logistical nightmare.

999
01:13:13,450 --> 01:13:16,150
Close quarters. 10, maybe 20 men.

1000
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:19,750
There's no tellin'
how many more are gonna be below deck.

1001
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:22,050
Can we stealth these guys?

1002
01:13:22,450 --> 01:13:25,650
With all that coke, they're gonna be ready.

1003
01:13:26,450 --> 01:13:28,850
Which brings me to sunny point Number 2.

1004
01:13:29,450 --> 01:13:33,050
Even if one of us gets through
and jacks the boat, we still got nothin'.

1005
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:34,850
What if we wait for the money?

1006
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:37,150
Ten more men at least.

1007
01:13:37,950 --> 01:13:40,750
In my opinion, it can't be done.

1008
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,350
Anyone who goes in
is not comin' out alive.

1009
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:46,450
- I'm gonna wait for the money.
- Me, too.

1010
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:49,950
- Did you hear what he just said?
- If I'm goin' in, I want a cut.

1011
01:13:50,050 --> 01:13:51,250
Me, too.

1012
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:54,750
There's nothing that can't be done.

1013
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:01,550
I just can't believe
we're gonna walk in to certain death.

1014
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:10,350
The news said it's raining in New York.

1015
01:14:32,050 --> 01:14:33,650
What language is that?

1016
01:14:33,850 --> 01:14:37,050
I don't know. Russian, I think.

1017
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:40,250
Hungarian?

1018
01:15:44,450 --> 01:15:46,950
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

1019
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:08,050
You kids ready?

1020
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:11,650
I would be if I didn't have to stop
and answer you.

1021
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:13,050
I'm ready.

1022
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:16,150
McManus, you better be set up
in 10 seconds.

1023
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:19,250
I'm ready.

1024
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:22,350
I want you to stay here.

1025
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,050
I'm supposed to cover--

1026
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:27,950
If we don't get out of this,
take the money and go.

1027
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,150
I can't--

1028
01:16:29,150 --> 01:16:31,550
Find Edie.
Tell her everything that happened.

1029
01:16:31,650 --> 01:16:33,650
She knows people. She knows what to do.

1030
01:16:33,750 --> 01:16:36,750
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

1031
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:39,350
- What if I--
- Just do what I say.

1032
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:41,250
Please.

1033
01:16:44,550 --> 01:16:46,150
Tell her that...

1034
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,350
Tell her I tried.

1035
01:17:04,550 --> 01:17:07,050
McManus, he's on his way.

1036
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:08,750
I'm there.

1037
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:04,750
One, two, three, four...

1038
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:07,950
...five, six, seven...

1039
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,050
Oswald was a fag.

1040
01:18:19,550 --> 01:18:20,550
Hi.

1041
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,750
How you doin'?

1042
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:27,950
Is there a problem?

1043
01:18:53,550 --> 01:18:54,450
Now.

1044
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:27,950
"Old McDonald had a farm

1045
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:30,550
"Ee-aye, ee-aye, O

1046
01:19:31,150 --> 01:19:35,450
"And on that farm, he shot some guys"

1047
01:20:09,150 --> 01:20:10,650
Elvis has left the building.

1048
01:21:21,950 --> 01:21:24,550
Hold fire. Hold fire. Vamonos!

1049
01:21:38,250 --> 01:21:39,450
Hello.

1050
01:22:33,850 --> 01:22:35,150
Why didn't you run?

1051
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:37,350
I froze up.

1052
01:22:38,150 --> 01:22:41,450
I thought about Fenster
and how he looked when we buried him.

1053
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:45,650
Then I thought about Keaton,
and it looked like he might pull it off.

1054
01:22:51,850 --> 01:22:54,050
A boy found a body on the beach today.

1055
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:56,550
Thrown clear of the boat.
Shot twice in the head.

1056
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,550
Two guys from the Bureau identified him.

1057
01:22:58,550 --> 01:23:00,750
- What else?
- His name was Arturo Marquez.

1058
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:02,750
A petty smuggler from Argentina.

1059
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:05,650
He was arrested last year in New York
for trafficking.

1060
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:09,550
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.

1061
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:12,950
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

1062
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:14,350
Now, get this.

1063
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:18,050
Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

1064
01:23:18,150 --> 01:23:19,450
Kobayashi.

1065
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:21,650
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony.

1066
01:23:21,750 --> 01:23:24,350
- He was a rat.
- A big fucking rat.

1067
01:23:24,350 --> 01:23:27,150
Arturo was very opposed
to returning to prison.

1068
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:31,150
So much so,
that he named close to 50 people.

1069
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:33,650
Guess who he named in the finale.

1070
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:36,050
Keyser Soze.

1071
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:37,750
There's more.

1072
01:23:50,150 --> 01:23:54,450
I'll tell you what I know.
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1073
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:58,050
There was no dope on that boat.

1074
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:41,250
You, stay quiet.

1075
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:42,750
He's here.

1076
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:47,150
I know he's here. That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.

1077
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:48,950
I know he's here!

1078
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:53,650
- You can't understand. That's him.
- Shut up.

1079
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:58,150
That's him. You hear me?
I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!

1080
01:26:56,350 --> 01:26:58,350
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know.

1081
01:26:58,450 --> 01:27:00,050
There's no coke.

1082
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:02,150
- What?
- You heard me, dumb fuck.

1083
01:27:02,250 --> 01:27:04,550
- There's no coke!
- What the fuck? No coke?

1084
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:07,250
I've been up and down
in every fucking room.

1085
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:09,550
- There's gotta be coke!
- There is nothing!

1086
01:27:09,650 --> 01:27:10,850
Nothing!

1087
01:27:11,450 --> 01:27:12,850
Don't you fuck with me.

1088
01:27:13,050 --> 01:27:16,850
There is no fucking coke!

1089
01:27:27,950 --> 01:27:29,550
I'm out of here.

1090
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:12,250
I told them nothing.

1091
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:14,550
I swear.

1092
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:17,850
I told them nothing. Please.

1093
01:29:04,250 --> 01:29:07,050
What the fuck is goin' on?

1094
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,550
The strangest thing.

1095
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,450
That's what you said.
You saw a man in a suit with a slim build.

1096
01:30:09,550 --> 01:30:11,050
Wait a minute.

1097
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:13,150
Are you saying you saw Keyser Soze?

1098
01:30:13,250 --> 01:30:16,750
- You said you didn't know who it was.
- I know there was dope on that boat.

1099
01:30:16,850 --> 01:30:18,350
- Stop stallin'.
- I'm not.

1100
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:21,050
- You know what I'm getting at.
- Get out of my face.

1101
01:30:21,150 --> 01:30:23,950
I got immunity. I don't have to take this.

1102
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:25,750
You know what I'm getting at.

1103
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:28,350
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- The truth!

1104
01:30:28,450 --> 01:30:30,550
Try to tell me
you saw someone kill Keaton.

1105
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:31,650
I did.

1106
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:33,150
You're lying to me.

1107
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:36,650
- You've known this whole time.
- I don't know what you're saying.

1108
01:30:36,750 --> 01:30:39,350
I did see Keaton get shot. I swear to you.

1109
01:30:39,450 --> 01:30:42,050
Why didn't you help him? You had a gun.

1110
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:44,050
He was your friend.

1111
01:30:47,950 --> 01:30:49,750
Because I was afraid.

1112
01:30:51,950 --> 01:30:54,550
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

1113
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:57,850
- Afraid of--
- I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1114
01:30:58,150 --> 01:31:02,050
It was Keyser Soze, I mean,
the Devil himself.

1115
01:31:03,350 --> 01:31:05,950
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1116
01:31:10,450 --> 01:31:12,150
What if you miss?

1117
01:31:17,250 --> 01:31:19,750
Let's get back to the pier.

1118
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:45,950
- Arturo Marquez. Ever hear of him?
- What? No.

1119
01:32:46,150 --> 01:32:48,750
He was a stool pigeon
for the Justice Department.

1120
01:32:48,850 --> 01:32:51,150
He swore out a statement
to federal marshals...

1121
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:54,650
...saying that he had seen
and could positively identify one...

1122
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:55,950
...Keyser Soze.

1123
01:32:56,450 --> 01:32:58,250
It says right here in the report.

1124
01:32:58,250 --> 01:33:01,050
He had intimate knowledge
of his businesses, including...

1125
01:33:01,150 --> 01:33:04,350
...but not exclusive to,
drug trafficking and murder.

1126
01:33:04,350 --> 01:33:05,950
I never heard of him.

1127
01:33:05,950 --> 01:33:08,850
His own people were selling him
to a gang of Hungarians.

1128
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:12,550
Most likely the same Hungarians
that Soze all but wiped out back in Turkey.

1129
01:33:12,850 --> 01:33:14,550
The money wasn't there for dope.

1130
01:33:14,650 --> 01:33:16,950
The Hungarians were going
to buy the one guy...

1131
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:19,150
...that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

1132
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:22,050
- I said I never heard of him.
- But Keaton did.

1133
01:33:22,150 --> 01:33:25,150
Edie Finneran was Marquez's
extradition advisor.

1134
01:33:25,250 --> 01:33:27,450
She knew who he was and what he knew.

1135
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:30,950
There were no drugs on that boat.
It was a hit.

1136
01:33:31,150 --> 01:33:33,650
A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy...

1137
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,850
...that could finger Keyser Soze.

1138
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:38,050
So Soze put some thieves to it...

1139
01:33:38,450 --> 01:33:40,850
...men he knew he could march
into certain death.

1140
01:33:41,150 --> 01:33:43,650
You're saying Soze
sent us to kill someone?

1141
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:47,950
I'm saying Keaton did.
He left you behind for a reason.

1142
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:49,550
Just do what I tell you.

1143
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:52,850
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere...

1144
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:54,850
...why did he give you the money to run?

1145
01:33:54,950 --> 01:33:58,250
- He could have used you on the boat.
- He wanted me to live.

1146
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:02,550
A one-time dirty cop without
a loyalty in the world...

1147
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:05,950
...finds it in his heart
to save a worthless rat cripple?

1148
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:07,450
No, sir. Why?

1149
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:09,250
Edie.

1150
01:34:09,350 --> 01:34:11,950
I don't buy that reform story for a minute.

1151
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:13,350
Even if I did...

1152
01:34:13,450 --> 01:34:17,050
...I certainly don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

1153
01:34:17,350 --> 01:34:18,550
So why?

1154
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:22,850
Because he was my friend.

1155
01:34:22,950 --> 01:34:26,850
No, he wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.

1156
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:28,350
What are you doing here?

1157
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:31,150
He saved you
because he wanted it that way.

1158
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,350
It was his will.

1159
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:35,650
- Keaton was Keyser Soze.
- No.

1160
01:34:35,650 --> 01:34:39,250
A man who could wrangle the wills
of men like Hockney and McManus.

1161
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:41,850
A man who could engineer a police lineup...

1162
01:34:41,950 --> 01:34:44,650
...through all his years of contacts in NYPD.

1163
01:34:44,750 --> 01:34:47,250
The kind of man
who could've killed Edie Finneran.

1164
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:55,150
She was found yesterday
at a hotel in Pennsylvania...

1165
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:57,050
...shot twice in the head.

1166
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:04,850
What do you think about Keaton now?

1167
01:35:06,150 --> 01:35:07,150
Edie?

1168
01:35:07,150 --> 01:35:09,450
He used all of you to get him on that boat.

1169
01:35:09,450 --> 01:35:12,850
He couldn't get on alone.
He had to pull the trigger himself...

1170
01:35:12,950 --> 01:35:14,850
...to make sure he got his man...

1171
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:17,050
...the one man that could identify him.

1172
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:19,750
This is all bullshit.

1173
01:35:19,950 --> 01:35:21,950
You said you saw him die.

1174
01:35:24,350 --> 01:35:25,350
Or did you?

1175
01:35:25,550 --> 01:35:27,950
You had to hide
when you heard the police cars.

1176
01:35:28,050 --> 01:35:30,450
You said you heard the shot
before the fire...

1177
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:32,850
...but you didn't see him die.

1178
01:35:33,150 --> 01:35:35,950
- I knew him. He would never--
- He programmed you.

1179
01:35:36,050 --> 01:35:38,650
He programmed you to tell us
what he wanted you to.

1180
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:40,950
He knew we were close.
You said it yourself.

1181
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:44,050
Where was the political pressure
to protect you from?

1182
01:35:44,350 --> 01:35:45,350
It was Keaton.

1183
01:35:45,450 --> 01:35:48,750
- Immunity was your reward.
- But why me?

1184
01:35:49,350 --> 01:35:51,450
Why not Fenster or McManus or Hockney?

1185
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:54,250
Why me? I'm stupid.
I'm a cripple. Why me?

1186
01:35:54,250 --> 01:35:55,750
Because you're a cripple.

1187
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:57,950
Because you're stupid.

1188
01:35:58,250 --> 01:36:00,150
Because you're weaker than them.

1189
01:36:04,450 --> 01:36:05,750
If he's dead...

1190
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:10,150
If what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

1191
01:36:11,650 --> 01:36:14,550
It was his idea to hit the taxi service,
wasn't it?

1192
01:36:14,650 --> 01:36:17,750
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.

1193
01:36:19,050 --> 01:36:21,650
We followed him from the beginning.

1194
01:36:23,350 --> 01:36:24,550
I didn't know.

1195
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:26,750
I saw him die.

1196
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:30,650
I believe he's dead. Christ.

1197
01:36:31,850 --> 01:36:33,650
You're not safe on your own.

1198
01:36:37,750 --> 01:36:38,950
You think he's...

1199
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:40,850
Keyser Soze?

1200
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:43,350
I don't know.

1201
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:48,750
Keyser Soze's a shield,
or like you said, a spook story.

1202
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:53,450
But I know Keaton, and someone
is out there pulling strings for you.

1203
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:57,650
- Stay here and let us protect you.
- I'm not bait. I post today.

1204
01:36:57,950 --> 01:36:59,350
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1205
01:36:59,950 --> 01:37:02,050
Capt. Leo wants you out of here.

1206
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:05,250
- Unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances.

1207
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:09,250
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1208
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:12,750
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1209
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:14,050
Maybe so.

1210
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:17,550
But I'm not a rat.

1211
01:37:34,250 --> 01:37:35,850
Fuckin' cops.

1212
01:38:00,350 --> 01:38:02,950
Excuse me, can I use your fax machine?

1213
01:38:06,850 --> 01:38:09,550
You'll have to sign for these, Mr.Kint.

1214
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:13,350
One watch, gold.

1215
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:15,950
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1216
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:18,750
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1217
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:21,450
We still got nothing.

1218
01:38:21,750 --> 01:38:24,050
I know what I wanted to know
about Keaton.

1219
01:38:24,050 --> 01:38:25,750
Which is nothing.

1220
01:38:26,250 --> 01:38:29,750
No matter.
He'll have to know how close we came.

1221
01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:32,850
Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...

1222
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:36,150
...if Keaton is alive,
he's not comin' up again.

1223
01:38:36,650 --> 01:38:38,450
I'll find him.

1224
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:40,350
Waste of time.

1225
01:38:43,150 --> 01:38:45,550
A rumor's not a rumor that doesn't die.

1226
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:47,150
What?

1227
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,250
Nothing.

1228
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:53,050
Man, you're a slob.

1229
01:38:53,150 --> 01:38:55,450
But it all has a system.

1230
01:38:56,350 --> 01:39:00,750
It all makes sense if you look at it right.
You gotta stand back from it.

1231
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:05,150
You wanna see a real horror show?
See my garage.

1232
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:44,550
Convince me. Tell me every last...

1233
01:39:44,650 --> 01:39:47,650
When I was in that barbershop quartet
in Skokie, Illinois...

1234
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:51,250
- Where's your head?
- We need to think, think back.

1235
01:39:51,350 --> 01:39:52,950
I'm sure you've heard tall tales.

1236
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:54,650
- Bricks Marlin.
- This isn't right.

1237
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:57,150
- I just wanna hear your story.
- It's all there.

1238
01:39:57,250 --> 01:40:00,650
- I'm tellin' it straight.
- Some guy in California called Redfoot.

1239
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:03,250
- A gift from Mr.Soze.
- Talk to me.

1240
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:06,350
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr.Redfoot knew nothing.

1241
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:09,450
- Using pawns...
- A big fat guy. Like, orca fat.

1242
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:11,250
There was a lawyer...

1243
01:40:11,550 --> 01:40:12,950
Kobayashi...

1244
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:16,550
When I was picking beans
in Guatemala we made fresh coffee.

1245
01:40:16,650 --> 01:40:19,650
- I know you thought he was a good man.
- I know he was good.

1246
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:24,950
- You tell me every last detail.
- The strangest thing.

1247
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:26,950
How do you shoot the Devil in the back?

1248
01:40:26,950 --> 01:40:30,250
This guy is protected from up
on high by the Prince of...

1249
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:32,650
What's your story, pretzel man?

1250
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:34,550
- There was a lawyer.
- What lawyer?

1251
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:35,750
I am Mr.Kobayashi.

1252
01:40:35,850 --> 01:40:39,350
- Kobayashi. Kobayashi.
- Tell me every last detail.

1253
01:40:39,450 --> 01:40:42,650
- I work for Keyser Soze.
- Convince me. Convince me.

1254
01:40:57,950 --> 01:41:00,550
Every creep and scumbag
that works the street...

1255
01:41:00,650 --> 01:41:02,750
...will know the name of Verbal Kint.

1256
01:41:03,450 --> 01:41:04,850
The cripple, did you see him?

1257
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:08,050
- The cripple! Which way did he go?
- He went out that way.

1258
01:41:08,150 --> 01:41:10,750
I know you know something.
I know you're not telling...

1259
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:11,950
I'm smarter than you...

1260
01:41:12,050 --> 01:41:14,550
...and I'm gonna find out
whether you like it or not.

1261
01:41:14,650 --> 01:41:16,550
To a cop, the explanation
is never complicated.

1262
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:18,150
- It's always simple.
- The truth!

1263
01:41:18,250 --> 01:41:21,150
There's no arch-criminal behind it all.

1264
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:24,050
Somebody with power,
somebody who is capable...

1265
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:25,850
Keyser Soze!

1266
01:41:26,650 --> 01:41:29,950
You think a guy like that
gets this close to getting caught...

1267
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:32,050
...and sticks his head out?

1268
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:35,950
Because you're stupid.
Because you're a cripple.

1269
01:41:36,050 --> 01:41:38,150
What I wanna know is, who's the gimp?

1270
01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:40,650
You've known the whole fuckin' time.

1271
01:41:40,650 --> 01:41:44,350
If he comes up for anything
it'll be for me. I'm sure Keaton is dead.

1272
01:41:44,350 --> 01:41:47,350
I can't feel my legs, Keyser.

1273
01:41:47,550 --> 01:41:49,950
First thing I learned on the job.
You know what?

1274
01:41:50,050 --> 01:41:53,550
- How to spot a murderer.
- You got the cripple in there?

1275
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:56,350
- Did he mention Keyser Soze?
- Who?

1276
01:41:56,650 --> 01:41:58,150
After that...

1277
01:41:58,650 --> 01:42:01,650
...my guess is you'll never hear
from him again.

1278
01:42:22,150 --> 01:42:24,450
The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled...

1279
01:42:24,650 --> 01:42:27,350
...was convincing the world he didn't exist.

1280
01:42:29,250 --> 01:42:30,450
And like that...

1281
01:42:32,250 --> 01:42:33,550
...he's gone.

<font color="#CCFF99"><i>HAVE A GOOD TIME<i>

2
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:24,974
An article, which I believe appeared
in a newspaper, asked why,

3
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:29,478
since it would seem that you are
in effect the Mayor of Chicago,

4
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:34,192
you're not simply being
appointed to that position.

5
00:03:37,236 --> 00:03:41,741
Well, I tell ya, it's touching.
Like a lot of things in life,

6
00:03:41,949 --> 00:03:46,287
we laugh because it's funny,
and we laugh because it's true.

7
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:48,456
Some people say,
reformers here say:

8
00:03:48,664 --> 00:03:52,627
"Put that man in jail,
what does he think he is doing?"

9
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:56,297
What I hope I'm doing, and here's where
your English paper's got a point is,

10
00:03:56,505 --> 00:03:58,799
I'm responding to
the will of the people.

11
00:04:01,761 --> 00:04:06,349
People are gonna drink. We all
know that. All I do is act on that.

12
00:04:06,557 --> 00:04:09,352
And all this talk of bootlegging.
What is bootlegging?

13
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,356
On the boat it's bootlegging,
on Lake Shore Drive it's hospitality.

14
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:15,816
I'm a businessman.

15
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,030
And what of your reputation is that you
control your business through violence?

16
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,868
That those that don't purchase your
product are dealt with violently.

17
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:33,376
It's all right.

18
00:04:34,835 --> 00:04:36,754
I grew up in a tough neighbourhood.

19
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:39,799
We used to say, "You can get further
with a kind word and a gun" ...

20
00:04:40,007 --> 00:04:43,094
"than you can
with just a kind word."

21
00:04:44,428 --> 00:04:46,681
And in that neighbourhood
it might've been true.

22
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:50,476
And sometimes
your reputation follows you.

23
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:54,647
There is violence in Chicago,
but not by me ...

24
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:59,151
and not by anybody I employ. And I tell
you why, because it's not good business.

25
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:34,645
Leave us alone down here,
we've got everything we need.

26
00:05:34,854 --> 00:05:37,857
The green beer you're peddlin'
ain't any good.

27
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:42,278
It's not supposed to be good.
It's supposed to be bought.

28
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:46,199
I'm not buyin' any.

29
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:52,246
Don't worry about it, Pops,
we won't come back.

30
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:58,294
- How's everyone at your house today?
- They're fine.

31
00:05:58,502 --> 00:06:02,548
- Is your Mama well?
- She has a little cold.

32
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:04,967
Oh, she does?

33
00:06:06,135 --> 00:06:09,347
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- But she'll be all right.

34
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:16,938
- There you go.
- Thank you.

35
00:06:17,146 --> 00:06:22,443
That's all right, sweetie.
You be careful crossin' the street.

36
00:06:22,693 --> 00:06:25,071
- Mister!
- You tell your Mama that ...

37
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,823
Hey, Mister! Wait!

38
00:06:28,032 --> 00:06:31,410
Mister! Wait!
You forgot your brief ...

39
00:07:36,767 --> 00:07:41,147
Yes, I heard it on the radio.

40
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:43,733
I know.

41
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:47,195
Now it's time to go to work.

42
00:07:55,244 --> 00:07:58,497
You'll make a good first impression.

43
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:09,342
I love you, Eliot.

44
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:16,057
Now, shoo.

45
00:08:17,892 --> 00:08:23,481
Eliot Ness, Special Agent
of the Treasury Department.

46
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:26,192
- Mr. Ness.
- Thank you, Chief.

47
00:08:26,442 --> 00:08:29,737
At the request of the City of Chicago,
the federal Government, specifically ...

48
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:33,699
the Department of the Treasury
has inaugurated a programme ...

49
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,453
to deal with the flow of illegal
liquor and the violence it creates.

50
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:41,457
Mr. Ness!
Of what does this programme consist?

51
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,544
I and other agents of the Treasury
will be working ...

52
00:08:44,752 --> 00:08:46,754
with the Chicago Police ...

53
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:49,173
Isn't it just another
showpiece programme?

54
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:53,553
- What do you think of prohibition?
- Do you drink, Mr. Ness?

55
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:57,640
- Come on, answer the questions.
- It's not just a showpiece.

56
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,060
And I'll tell you
how I feel about prohibition.

57
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,687
It is the law of the land.

58
00:09:02,937 --> 00:09:05,690
Do you consider yourself
a crusader, is that it?

59
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:08,192
What qualifications
do you have for the job?

60
00:09:08,442 --> 00:09:10,778
Do you have any political ambitions?

61
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:13,698
All right, boys,
I think that's enough.

62
00:09:16,158 --> 00:09:19,328
What are your real plans?
What have you got coming up?

63
00:09:19,579 --> 00:09:21,622
You'll have to read about it
in the paper.

64
00:09:21,873 --> 00:09:25,501
- Let me ride along with you.
- No. Can't help you.

65
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:28,963
Mr. Ness, Lieutenant Alderson,
the Flying Squad.

66
00:09:29,213 --> 00:09:32,133
Are you ready to meet the men?

67
00:09:33,551 --> 00:09:35,553
Yes, I am.

68
00:09:45,396 --> 00:09:48,357
I have one more thing to say.

69
00:09:52,195 --> 00:09:55,489
I know that many of you take a drink.

70
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,577
What you've done before today
is not my concern.

71
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:03,331
But now we must be pure,
and I want you to stop.

72
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:09,128
It's not a question of whether it's
'a harmless drink'. It may well be.

73
00:10:09,378 --> 00:10:10,922
But it's against the law.

74
00:10:11,172 --> 00:10:15,384
And as we are going to enforce
the law, we must do first by example.

75
00:10:20,223 --> 00:10:22,767
Are there any questions?

76
00:10:24,185 --> 00:10:27,522
Good. The Department
of the Treasury's had ...

77
00:10:27,772 --> 00:10:29,857
a man undercover here
for some time now.

78
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:32,109
We've received word
from this informant ...

79
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,821
that a large shipment of Canadian
whiskey has arrived in Chicago.

80
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:38,741
So I hope that you have signed on
for some action.

81
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:51,462
Remember, the liquor cases
are marked with the red maple leaf.

82
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:54,924
The Treasury Agent is
in a grey suit with a white scarf.

83
00:10:55,132 --> 00:10:59,679
- He is not to be arrested.
- A grey suit and a white scarf.

84
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:04,308
- That's it. Are your men ready?
- Yes, sir. They are.

85
00:11:11,232 --> 00:11:14,694
- At ease.
- Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

86
00:11:20,992 --> 00:11:23,536
- How are we doin'?
- Okay.

87
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:33,004
- Want part of a sandwich?
- No, thank you, sir.

88
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,179
- You nervous?
- No, sir.

89
00:11:44,223 --> 00:11:47,977
- Been with the unit long?
- A short while.

90
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:53,065
- I suppose we all want to do well.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:01,824
A message from my wife.

92
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:06,287
- You married?
- Yes, sir, I am.

93
00:12:06,537 --> 00:12:09,290
Nice to be married, huh?

94
00:12:26,432 --> 00:12:28,309
Just follow me.

95
00:13:10,351 --> 00:13:13,104
- Oh, God ...
- Federal officer. Hands in the air.

96
00:13:13,354 --> 00:13:15,648
Get 'em up. Drop it.

97
00:13:15,898 --> 00:13:18,442
Damn it, I can't, it'll break.

98
00:13:19,569 --> 00:13:22,029
Mr. Ness. Look, I was just ...

99
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,323
Geez, I'm sorry.

100
00:13:26,325 --> 00:13:30,079
Listen, I can do a lot for you,
what you're tryin' to do.

101
00:13:30,288 --> 00:13:32,498
I get the big scoop,
you make a big splash.

102
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:37,169
Get some support. What do you say?
Let's be real, let me help you.

103
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,630
Okay. Just shut up.

104
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:09,035
All right now ...
Let's do some good!

105
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:24,425
Hold it right there!

106
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:31,641
Federal officer. You're under arrest
for violations of the Volstead Act.

107
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:43,569
Let's cover the doors!
Don't let anybody out!

108
00:14:45,404 --> 00:14:47,615
Preseuski.

109
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:51,786
- I'm here with permission.
- Who gave you permission?

110
00:14:52,036 --> 00:14:54,956
- Mr. Ness!
- Sorry, let him through here.

111
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:58,709
Let him through here.

112
00:14:59,835 --> 00:15:03,005
You want to take your picture,
take it now.

113
00:15:04,131 --> 00:15:06,509
- You ready?
- Ready.

114
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,704
Liquor, huh?

115
00:15:37,164 --> 00:15:39,125
Get him out of here.

116
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:43,462
- Tear the place apart!
- I mean now, get him out!

117
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:50,595
That means you, too.

118
00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:57,351
Christ!

119
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,350
Now, what do you think you're doing?

120
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,480
You want to throw garbage? Throw it
in the goddamn trash basket.

121
00:17:24,689 --> 00:17:27,900
Don't you have
more important things to do?

122
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,278
Yeah.

123
00:17:30,486 --> 00:17:33,030
But I'm not doing them right now.

124
00:17:34,156 --> 00:17:36,951
Do we understand each other?

125
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:43,082
Okay, pal, why the Mohaska?

126
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,337
- Why are you packin' the gun?
- I'm a Treasury Officer.

127
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,426
All right.

128
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:57,346
Just remember
what we talked about now.

129
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,728
Hey ... Wait a minute!

130
00:18:03,978 --> 00:18:07,732
What the hell kind of police
do you have in this goddamn city?

131
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,818
You just turned your back
on an armed man.

132
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:14,780
- You're a Treasury officer.
- I just told you I was.

133
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:18,117
Who would claim to be that,
who was not?

134
00:18:23,998 --> 00:18:27,084
What's your name and unit?

135
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:33,424
It's right here.

136
00:18:34,842 --> 00:18:38,221
You got a beef?
What is it?

137
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,684
How did you know I had a gun?

138
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:47,647
What do you want,
a free lesson in police work?

139
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,400
No.

140
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,697
Are you okay, pal?

141
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:01,244
I had a rough day on the job.

142
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:05,957
- Are you going home now?
- I was about to.

143
00:19:08,918 --> 00:19:12,922
Well, then, you just fulfilled
the first rule of law enforcement.

144
00:19:17,009 --> 00:19:20,930
Make sure when your shift is over
you go home alive.

145
00:19:22,056 --> 00:19:24,308
Here endeth the lesson.

146
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:27,288
$100,000 for 40 barrels.
Make sure there are no empties.

147
00:20:27,496 --> 00:20:30,583
I'm gonna give you the ledger,
everything is in the book.

148
00:20:30,791 --> 00:20:33,753
55 gallons to the barrel.

149
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:50,353
- It's Eddie.
- Come in, Eddie.

150
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:20,132
So, he gets into the snowplough,
and he says, "Let's do some good".

151
00:21:20,341 --> 00:21:22,760
And then, we bust through ...

152
00:22:11,726 --> 00:22:15,354
- Mr. Ness?
- Yes?

153
00:22:15,563 --> 00:22:18,900
I came here to thank you.

154
00:22:19,108 --> 00:22:20,526
It was ...

155
00:22:20,735 --> 00:22:24,530
my little girl that got killed
with that bomb.

156
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:27,867
I'm sorry. Please.

157
00:22:29,535 --> 00:22:32,038
I'm ... I'm so sorry.

158
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:38,044
You see, it's ... because I know
that you have children, too.

159
00:22:39,128 --> 00:22:44,383
And that this is real for you,
that these men cause us tragedy.

160
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:48,304
And I know that you will
put a stop to them.

161
00:22:49,388 --> 00:22:51,182
And you do that, now.

162
00:23:48,197 --> 00:23:51,492
- What do you want?
- I'd like to talk to you.

163
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:55,872
Come in.

164
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,253
I need a small group of men,
handpicked, starting with you.

165
00:24:02,461 --> 00:24:06,424
Ness! I am just a poor beat cop.

166
00:24:07,425 --> 00:24:12,847
- Now, how can I help you?
- Just work with me.

167
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:16,642
- But why should I, though?
- Because you're a good cop.

168
00:24:18,102 --> 00:24:20,730
- How do you know that?
- You told me.

169
00:24:21,522 --> 00:24:23,941
If I'm such a good cop ...

170
00:24:25,234 --> 00:24:28,237
How come I'm walkin' the beat,
then, at my age?

171
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:30,364
Do you want to tell me?

172
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:33,451
Well, maybe I'm that
Whore with a Heart of Gold.

173
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:37,413
Or The One Good Cop in the Bad Town?
Is that what you want to hear?

174
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:39,624
I didn't ask you, and I don't care!

175
00:24:39,832 --> 00:24:43,586
You want to stay on the beat?
You do that.

176
00:24:43,794 --> 00:24:48,132
If you'd like to come with me,
I need your help.

177
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:51,802
I'm askin' you for help.

178
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:59,769
Well ... that's the thing you fear,
isn't it?

179
00:25:03,481 --> 00:25:08,778
Mr. Ness, I wish I'd met you
ten years and ... twenty pounds ago.

180
00:25:08,986 --> 00:25:14,700
But ... I just think it got ...
more important to me ...

181
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,619
to stay alive.

182
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:27,922
And that's why I'm walkin' the beat.
Thank you, no.

183
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,898
That's good, Andy. Let's start up
the thing and take a little ride.

184
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:48,651
I wanna hear
that Stutz Bearcat engine, boy!

185
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,196
- Yeah, let me open the door here.
- Yeah, go ahead.

186
00:25:52,405 --> 00:25:55,825
Whoopsy daisy,
pick up the door there, Andy.

187
00:25:56,033 --> 00:25:59,954
Throw it in the back seat.
Now, let me get the thing started.

188
00:26:00,162 --> 00:26:02,206
Yeah, start it up, Andy.

189
00:26:09,171 --> 00:26:12,258
Holy mackerel, Andy!
Listen to that Bearcat motor!

190
00:26:12,466 --> 00:26:17,180
Yeah, it sounds like the bear
is chasin' that cat all round it!

191
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,892
Andy! She's boilin' over!

192
00:26:31,944 --> 00:26:34,864
- Mr. Ness?
- Yes.

193
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:37,491
Oscar Wallace.

194
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:42,413
I've been assigned here
by the Washington Bureau.

195
00:26:42,622 --> 00:26:44,874
- Really?
- Yes.

196
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:49,795
Well, I'm glad to have you here,
Mr. Wallace. Would you excuse me?

197
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,716
We are a little in the dark here,
but any ideas you may have ...

198
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:55,885
Well, actually, yes, sir, I do.

199
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:59,972
And the one I want to try first ...
is this.

200
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:07,647
He has not filed a return since 1926.

201
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,860
- A return ...?
- An income tax return.

202
00:27:14,362 --> 00:27:15,863
- Income tax.
- Yes, sir.

203
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:20,493
- What do you do at the Bureau?
- Oh, I'm an accountant.

204
00:27:21,577 --> 00:27:25,706
- An accountant?
- Yes, and the Bureau sent me here ...

205
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,001
Would you excuse me?

206
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:34,757
Please.

207
00:28:00,324 --> 00:28:02,785
Okay. Let's go.

208
00:28:02,994 --> 00:28:06,914
- Where are we going?
- These walls have ears.

209
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:13,838
You said you wanted to know
how to get Capone.

210
00:28:16,173 --> 00:28:20,553
Do you really want to get him?
You see what I'm saying?

211
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:25,349
- What are you prepared to do?
- Everything within the law.

212
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:28,519
And then what are you
prepared to do?

213
00:28:28,728 --> 00:28:31,105
If you open the ball
on these people,

214
00:28:31,314 --> 00:28:33,858
you must be prepared
to go all the way.

215
00:28:34,066 --> 00:28:37,236
Because they won't give up the fight
until one of you is dead.

216
00:28:37,445 --> 00:28:39,530
I want to get Capone.
I don't know how.

217
00:28:39,739 --> 00:28:44,619
Here's how you get Capone:
He pulls a knife, you pull a gun.

218
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:47,580
He sends one of yours to hospital,
you send one of his to the morgue!

219
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:51,417
That's the Chicago way!
And that's how you get Capone.

220
00:28:53,711 --> 00:28:56,923
Now, do you want to do that?

221
00:28:57,131 --> 00:28:59,842
Are you ready to do that?

222
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:05,473
I'm making you a deal.
Do you want this deal?

223
00:29:06,516 --> 00:29:08,935
I have sworn to put this man away,

224
00:29:09,143 --> 00:29:14,315
with any and all legal means
at my disposal, and I will do so.

225
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:25,493
Well, the Lord hates a coward.

226
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:35,878
Do you know what a blood oath is,
Mr. Ness?

227
00:29:36,087 --> 00:29:39,048
- Yes.
- Good. 'Cause you just took one.

228
00:29:41,092 --> 00:29:44,303
How do you think Capone knew
about your raid the other night?

229
00:29:44,512 --> 00:29:48,140
- Somebody on the cops told him.
- Right. Welcome to Chicago.

230
00:29:48,349 --> 00:29:51,811
This town stinks
like a whorehouse at low tide.

231
00:29:52,019 --> 00:29:56,524
First, who can you trust?
Nobody. The cops, nobody.

232
00:29:56,732 --> 00:30:01,487
- 'Cause nobody wants you here.
- Then why are you helping me?

233
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:04,699
Because I swore to uphold the law.

234
00:30:04,907 --> 00:30:07,743
And if you believe that,
I'll tell you another.

235
00:30:07,952 --> 00:30:12,206
- Now, who can you trust?
- I can trust nobody.

236
00:30:12,415 --> 00:30:16,502
- That's the sorry truth.
- Then, where are we gonna get help?

237
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:21,549
If you're afraid of getting a rotten
apple, don't go to the barrel.

238
00:30:21,757 --> 00:30:24,093
Get it off the tree.

239
00:30:25,178 --> 00:30:26,679
Get it off the tree ...

240
00:30:28,973 --> 00:30:32,143
Finger out of the trigger guard!
Eject those cartridges!

241
00:30:32,351 --> 00:30:35,521
Lay the revolver on the ledge
and stand back!

242
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:37,148
About face!

243
00:30:37,356 --> 00:30:41,110
Barry! I want you to meet
Mr. Eliot Ness.

244
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:45,114
Treasury Department. How are you?
We need a recruit for extended duty.

245
00:30:45,323 --> 00:30:49,952
He is to be seconded to the Treasury
Department. We have the full ...

246
00:30:50,161 --> 00:30:53,414
Barry? Who is consistently
the best shot of this class?

247
00:30:53,623 --> 00:30:58,544
- Williamson and Stone.
- Call them out, one at a time.

248
00:30:58,753 --> 00:31:01,172
- Are either of the men married?
- No.

249
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,966
- Good.
- Williamson!

250
00:31:04,175 --> 00:31:08,679
- You're married.
- I don't want any married men.

251
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:13,392
All right, stand easy, son.
I want to ask you something.

252
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:18,022
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect and ...

253
00:31:18,231 --> 00:31:20,942
To protect and serve ...
To protect and ...

254
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,321
Please don't search for the yearbook
answer. Just tell me what you think.

255
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,533
- What I think? I ...
- You ...

256
00:31:28,741 --> 00:31:31,869
could help ... the force.

257
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:35,873
- You can help ...
- With the force.

258
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:40,711
Thank you.
There goes the next Chief of Police.

259
00:31:47,301 --> 00:31:48,803
At ease!

260
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:52,306
Stone! Out here.

261
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:56,602
This kid's a prodigy.

262
00:31:58,604 --> 00:32:02,859
- Why do you want to join the force?
- To protect the property and ...

263
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:06,028
Oh, please, don't waste my time
with that bullshit.

264
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:10,283
Where are you from, Stone?

265
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:14,871
- From the Southside.
- Stone?

266
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:18,082
George Stone, that's your name?

267
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:23,921
- What's your real name?
- That is my real name.

268
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:26,465
Nah! What was it
before you changed it?

269
00:32:30,261 --> 00:32:33,181
- Giuseppe Petri.
- Geez, I knew it!

270
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:36,309
That's all you need,
one thieving wop on the team!

271
00:32:37,476 --> 00:32:39,145
What's that you said?

272
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:43,149
I said that you're a lyin' member
of a no-good race.

273
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:49,197
That's much better than you,
you stinkin' Irish pig.

274
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,201
Oh, I like him.

275
00:32:56,370 --> 00:32:58,414
Yeah, I like him, too.

276
00:32:59,123 --> 00:33:01,918
You just joined
the Treasury Department, son.

277
00:33:03,377 --> 00:33:05,421
Yeah, okay.

278
00:33:06,756 --> 00:33:08,883
Eliot Ness.

279
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:13,012
With reports from stake-outs
on the North and West side, and ...

280
00:33:13,221 --> 00:33:15,973
Thank you, Lieutenant. Thank you.

281
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:25,316
What do you think?

282
00:33:25,525 --> 00:33:28,778
I think there's nothing
like vaudeville.

283
00:33:28,986 --> 00:33:33,824
- That's what I think.
- Now, are you ready to go to work?

284
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:37,578
- Where are we going?
- On a liquor raid.

285
00:33:37,787 --> 00:33:39,580
We need another man.

286
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:41,999
Mr. Ness? This is very interesting.

287
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:46,295
I've found a financial disbursement
pattern which shows some irregu ...

288
00:33:46,504 --> 00:33:48,464
- You carry a badge?
- Yes.

289
00:33:48,673 --> 00:33:50,716
Carry a gun.

290
00:34:07,275 --> 00:34:09,694
- Jimmy ...?
- What?

291
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:14,532
What the hell are you dressed for?
Halloween?

292
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,617
Shut up. I'm working.

293
00:34:16,826 --> 00:34:18,369
Where? The circus?

294
00:34:39,932 --> 00:34:42,685
- Well, here we are.
- What are we doing here?

295
00:34:42,894 --> 00:34:44,979
Liquor raid.

296
00:34:46,814 --> 00:34:48,149
Here?!

297
00:34:48,357 --> 00:34:52,653
Everybody knows where the booze is.
The problem isn't finding it.

298
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:57,825
The problem is who wants
to cross Capone. Let's go.

299
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:07,877
You'd better be damn sure, Malone.

300
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:17,762
If you walk through this door,
you're walking into a world of trouble.

301
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,932
There's no turning back.
Do you understand?

302
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,600
Yes, I do.

303
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,937
Good. Give me that axe.

304
00:35:34,779 --> 00:35:37,615
- Federal officers!
- Get your hands in the air!

305
00:35:37,823 --> 00:35:40,117
- Nobody moves!
- This is a raid!

306
00:35:41,202 --> 00:35:43,329
- Everybody ...
- What are you doin' here?

307
00:35:43,538 --> 00:35:47,291
All this stuff is impounded!
You're all under arrest!

308
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,295
Hey! This isn't right!
Hey! This is no good!

309
00:35:51,504 --> 00:35:55,132
- You got a warrant?
- Sure! Here's my warrant.

310
00:35:56,759 --> 00:35:59,804
How do you think he feels now?
Better ... or worse?

311
00:36:08,604 --> 00:36:10,982
- What is that?
- What is that?

312
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,360
- Yes, what is it?
- God, I'm with a heathen.

313
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:19,574
That is my callbox key.
And that is Saint Jude.

314
00:36:19,782 --> 00:36:24,245
Il Santo Jude.
He's the patron saint of lost causes.

315
00:36:24,453 --> 00:36:27,123
And policemen.

316
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:31,878
- Patron saint of policemen?
- Everybody needs a friend.

317
00:36:32,962 --> 00:36:36,257
Lost causes, policemen ...

318
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:40,052
- Which do you want to be?
- I want to be a cop.

319
00:36:40,261 --> 00:36:42,096
- You do?
- Yes.

320
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:44,515
Why?

321
00:36:44,724 --> 00:36:49,353
'To protect the property
and the citizenry ... '

322
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:53,900
Whoa, it's all right.

323
00:36:54,108 --> 00:36:56,611
- What?!
- I got to tell you, congratulations!

324
00:36:56,819 --> 00:37:00,615
It's okay if I get a picture
of you and your men?

325
00:37:00,823 --> 00:37:03,701
Yeah. But not for publication.
Just for us!

326
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:06,537
Anything you say, Mr. Ness.

327
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:10,791
Closer in ... Oh, that's great.
Okay, ready? Hold it.

328
00:37:18,508 --> 00:37:21,093
Life goes on.

329
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:29,310
A man becomes pre-eminent,
he's expected to have enthusiasms.

330
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,562
Enthusiasms ...

331
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,441
Enthusiasms ...

332
00:37:36,817 --> 00:37:38,778
What are mine?

333
00:37:39,779 --> 00:37:43,783
What draws my admiration?
What is that which gives me joy?

334
00:37:43,991 --> 00:37:47,245
- Dames!
- Boozin'!

335
00:37:49,914 --> 00:37:52,208
Baseball!

336
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:00,758
A man ...

337
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:04,303
A man stands alone at the plate.

338
00:38:06,347 --> 00:38:08,933
This is the time for what?

339
00:38:09,892 --> 00:38:12,645
For individual achievement.

340
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:16,357
There he stands alone.

341
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:19,735
But in the field, what?

342
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,197
Part of a team.

343
00:38:23,948 --> 00:38:26,659
Teamwork ...

344
00:38:29,287 --> 00:38:35,084
Looks, throws, catches, hustles.
Part of one big team.

345
00:38:36,252 --> 00:38:41,507
Bats himself the live-long day,
Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on.

346
00:38:43,259 --> 00:38:47,305
If his team don't field ... what is he?

347
00:38:49,557 --> 00:38:51,392
You follow me?

348
00:38:51,601 --> 00:38:54,270
No one.

349
00:38:54,478 --> 00:38:59,609
Sunny day, the stands are full
of fans. What does he have to say?

350
00:39:01,611 --> 00:39:05,239
I'm goin' out there for myself.

351
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:11,954
But ... I get nowhere
unless the team wins.

352
00:39:12,163 --> 00:39:14,457
- Team!
- Team.

353
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:23,257
Jesus Christ!

354
00:39:46,697 --> 00:39:49,325
'Now I lay me down to sleep'

355
00:39:49,534 --> 00:39:52,912
'I pray the Lord my soul to keep'

356
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,915
'If I should die before I wake'

357
00:39:56,123 --> 00:39:59,502
'I pray the Lord my soul to take'

358
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,629
- Amen.
- God bless ...

359
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,800
God bless Mommy, God bless Annie,
God bless Daddy. Amen.

360
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:08,010
Amen.

361
00:40:16,769 --> 00:40:18,813
Good night.

362
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:21,065
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, little girl.

363
00:40:21,274 --> 00:40:25,111
Want to rub Eskimo?
Butterfly?

364
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:37,874
- Where are you going?
- What?

365
00:40:40,334 --> 00:40:41,836
Where are you going?

366
00:40:42,044 --> 00:40:44,881
I thought I'd go downstairs,
some work to do for tomorrow.

367
00:40:45,089 --> 00:40:49,343
- You had a full day today, though?
- Yes, I certainly did.

368
00:40:49,552 --> 00:40:51,679
And you've still got
some energy left?

369
00:40:51,888 --> 00:40:53,598
Oh, a lot of work.

370
00:40:53,806 --> 00:40:59,437
Well, why don't you come up
and brush my hair? You 'Detective'.

371
00:41:13,242 --> 00:41:17,038
- How are we doin'?
- Capone's organisation is diverse.

372
00:41:17,246 --> 00:41:21,667
It owns Canadian Holding Company
Associations, which owns in turn ...

373
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:25,796
Green Light Laundry, Midwest Cabs,
Jolly Time Playthings ...

374
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,633
- Jolly Time Playthings?
- Yes.

375
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:31,427
Remind me to get a present
for my daughter.

376
00:41:31,636 --> 00:41:35,264
Bahama Ship-to-Shore,
Miss Lucy Togs ... the list is endless!

377
00:41:35,473 --> 00:41:39,185
And all the business is legitimate,
and none is owned by Al Capone.

378
00:41:39,393 --> 00:41:42,396
But we can get him on
income tax evasion if we can show ...

379
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:46,734
that any of the 'organisation'
business money is going to him.

380
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:51,155
- Legally, he receives no income.
- He doesn't receive anything?

381
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:54,909
- Mr. Ness? You have a visitor.
- Mister Ness!

382
00:41:55,117 --> 00:41:58,204
Could we talk for a minute?
I'm John O'Shea, Alderman ...

383
00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:00,289
Yes, I know who you are.

384
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:05,920
Would you excuse us?

385
00:42:07,922 --> 00:42:11,843
We are busy with several large
operations. What can I do for you?

386
00:42:12,051 --> 00:42:15,263
I came up to congratulate you
on a job well done.

387
00:42:16,931 --> 00:42:21,227
Share your good fortune
on such a lovely day.

388
00:42:25,022 --> 00:42:26,649
What's that?

389
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:34,615
- What is that?
- Mr. Ness, you're an educated man.

390
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:38,286
Let me pay you the compliment
of being blunt.

391
00:42:38,494 --> 00:42:44,292
There is a large and popular business
which you are causing dismay.

392
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:50,131
Why don't you just cross the street
and let things take their course?

393
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:53,342
Would you come in here, please?

394
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,518
In Roman times, when a fellow tried
to bribe a public official,

395
00:43:02,727 --> 00:43:04,937
they would cut off his nose,
sew him in a bag ...

396
00:43:05,146 --> 00:43:08,774
with a wild animal,
and throw that bag in the river.

397
00:43:08,983 --> 00:43:13,362
You tell your master
that we must agree to ... disagree!

398
00:43:14,822 --> 00:43:18,034
- You're making a mistake.
- I'm beginning to enjoy my mistakes.

399
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:22,830
You fellows are 'untouchable',
is that it? No one can get to you?

400
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,417
You tell Capone ...
that I'll see him in hell.

401
00:43:29,629 --> 00:43:31,631
Hey! Nice house!

402
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,675
I said, nice house!
Do you live there?

403
00:43:36,344 --> 00:43:39,972
Little girl's havin' a birthday, huh?

404
00:43:40,181 --> 00:43:42,141
Yes.

405
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:44,602
Nice to have a family.

406
00:43:47,313 --> 00:43:50,024
Yes, it is.

407
00:43:50,233 --> 00:43:54,737
A man should take care,
see that nothin' happens to them.

408
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:11,671
Catherine?!

409
00:44:13,172 --> 00:44:15,049
Catherine!

410
00:44:15,258 --> 00:44:17,718
- Where's the baby?
- She's upstairs. Eliot!

411
00:44:30,565 --> 00:44:34,277
- What were you doing up?
- I had to finish my ironing.

412
00:44:34,485 --> 00:44:39,532
You did? You're gonna come
with Daddy now, okay?

413
00:44:51,294 --> 00:44:53,713
Eliot? Okay, it's all right!

414
00:44:53,921 --> 00:44:56,215
Okay, let's go.

415
00:44:56,424 --> 00:45:00,219
Stay there!
Keep your eye on the street!

416
00:45:01,971 --> 00:45:05,516
- Where's Malone?
- On the stake-out. He'll be here.

417
00:45:05,725 --> 00:45:09,103
- Who's this guy?
- He's on Malone's list. He's okay.

418
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:15,109
Drive to the station. She'll let you
know where to go when you get there.

419
00:45:15,318 --> 00:45:17,570
Take off your hat.

420
00:45:17,778 --> 00:45:21,115
Anything happens, shoot first.
You understand me?

421
00:45:21,324 --> 00:45:23,534
Yes, Mr. Ness.

422
00:45:26,829 --> 00:45:28,497
Kiss.

423
00:45:28,706 --> 00:45:31,834
- Eskimo and butterfly, Dad.
- Okay.

424
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:37,423
Now, go!

425
00:45:59,487 --> 00:46:01,155
Malone!

426
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,699
- Are they okay?
- Yeah.

427
00:46:03,908 --> 00:46:07,286
- You sure the cop's okay?
- He'd better be, he's my cousin.

428
00:46:07,495 --> 00:46:10,706
I want to hurt the man, Malone!
You hear me?!

429
00:46:10,915 --> 00:46:13,876
I want to take the battle to him.
I want to hurt Capone.

430
00:46:14,085 --> 00:46:17,588
Well, then, a Merry Christmas,
we've got some great news.

431
00:46:17,797 --> 00:46:20,258
A huge international
shipment's coming.

432
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:25,054
We've got the time, the place
and the whole shebang.

433
00:46:25,263 --> 00:46:28,349
Well, what are we doin'
standin' here, then?

434
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:31,435
How do you come by this information?

435
00:46:31,644 --> 00:46:33,771
That's the second rule
of police work:

436
00:46:33,980 --> 00:46:36,732
If you want to keep a secret,
don't tell the boss.

437
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:45,283
You know he's making
over $3 million a year?

438
00:46:45,491 --> 00:46:48,077
But he's paid no taxes,
nothing's in his name.

439
00:46:48,286 --> 00:46:50,538
If we can establish
any payments to him,

440
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:53,791
we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion.

441
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,334
What?

442
00:46:55,543 --> 00:46:59,881
I said, we can prosecute him
for income tax evasion!

443
00:47:00,089 --> 00:47:03,426
Try a murderer
for not paying his taxes?!

444
00:47:03,634 --> 00:47:06,679
Well, it's better than nothing.

445
00:47:06,888 --> 00:47:10,892
All right. How do we
link him to the money?

446
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:14,020
I don't know.

447
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:18,149
Go to sleep, Oscar.

448
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:08,074
A convoy of 5-10 trucks
with good Canadian whiskey ...

449
00:48:08,282 --> 00:48:11,953
will be met by a high-level member
of the Capone organisation.

450
00:48:12,161 --> 00:48:15,748
He will be bringing full payment
for the shipment in cash.

451
00:48:15,957 --> 00:48:21,838
Now, the meet is to take place just
over the border on the American side.

452
00:48:22,046 --> 00:48:25,258
We want to confiscate
the liquor and the cash.

453
00:48:25,466 --> 00:48:29,387
- Captain?
- We will await their signal.

454
00:48:29,595 --> 00:48:32,723
When they're on the road
and have given the signal,

455
00:48:32,932 --> 00:48:36,727
we will engage from
the Canadian side of the bridge.

456
00:48:36,936 --> 00:48:38,938
Thus taking them
by surprise from the rear.

457
00:48:39,146 --> 00:48:43,818
And surprise, as you very well know,
Mr. Ness, is half the battle.

458
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:47,238
Surprise is half the battle.
Many things are half the battle.

459
00:48:47,446 --> 00:48:51,784
Losing is half the battle.
Let's think about what is all the battle.

460
00:48:51,993 --> 00:48:54,495
Let's take the fight
to them, gentlemen!

461
00:48:54,704 --> 00:48:56,914
Thank you, Captain.

462
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:01,794
All right! Move out!

463
00:49:19,187 --> 00:49:21,939
Take it easy.

464
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:26,527
Take it easy!
It'll all happen in time.

465
00:49:27,862 --> 00:49:30,239
This is the job.

466
00:49:30,448 --> 00:49:34,118
Don't wait for it to happen,
don't even want it to happen.

467
00:49:34,327 --> 00:49:36,954
Just watch what does happen.

468
00:49:38,164 --> 00:49:40,208
Are you my 'tutor'?

469
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:44,253
Yes, sir, that I am.

470
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:49,926
- Did you check it already?
- Yes, I did.

471
00:49:50,134 --> 00:49:52,220
Then leave it alone.

472
00:49:52,887 --> 00:49:55,473
You're a good cop, Giuseppe.

473
00:49:55,681 --> 00:49:59,310
You're doing good.
You're gonna do just fine.

474
00:50:01,729 --> 00:50:05,816
- Wallace, are you cold?
- Yes, I am, a little.

475
00:50:06,025 --> 00:50:09,111
Then stamp your feet.
It'll keep you warm.

476
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,406
You learn something,
20 years walking the beat.

477
00:50:12,615 --> 00:50:16,953
Stitches and standing in the rain ...

478
00:50:46,148 --> 00:50:48,359
Listen, Mr. Ness ...

479
00:50:50,236 --> 00:50:51,863
I had an idea.

480
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:50,421
You all have your spare shells?

481
00:52:04,852 --> 00:52:09,440
If you have to fire,
hold low and squeeze.

482
00:52:09,649 --> 00:52:12,568
And put your man down.

483
00:52:15,071 --> 00:52:17,740
Because he'll do the same to you.

484
00:52:17,949 --> 00:52:20,201
Shoot to kill.

485
00:52:20,409 --> 00:52:24,747
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yes, I did. Shoot to kill.

486
00:52:26,332 --> 00:52:28,793
Let's go.

487
00:52:52,275 --> 00:52:53,651
Easy ...

488
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,488
The Canadians will not show
until I flash the badge.

489
00:52:57,738 --> 00:53:01,284
So we must cover the ground
to the bridge as quickly as possible.

490
00:53:01,492 --> 00:53:03,202
George, the count's right.

491
00:53:03,411 --> 00:53:06,706
I'm concerned about
the size of these barrels!

492
00:53:06,914 --> 00:53:09,584
Malone, you and I will
take the men ...

493
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:12,712
Move it! Move it, Georgie!

494
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,424
Get over here!
Leave the stuff in the cars!

495
00:53:17,383 --> 00:53:18,718
Charge!

496
00:53:20,928 --> 00:53:22,847
What the hell!
You got to die of somethin'.

497
00:53:26,142 --> 00:53:30,104
- Look! Here they come!
- Mounties! Let's get out of here!

498
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:32,273
Move, move!

499
00:53:41,782 --> 00:53:44,118
Let's go!

500
00:53:48,498 --> 00:53:49,790
I can't believe it!

501
00:53:49,999 --> 00:53:53,044
- Here are the codes.
- Give me that.

502
00:53:53,252 --> 00:53:55,046
Don't let those cars off the bridge!

503
00:54:13,898 --> 00:54:15,775
Stone, take the first car!

504
00:54:17,485 --> 00:54:19,946
Get this shit out of the way!

505
00:54:39,632 --> 00:54:40,967
Tough guy!

506
00:54:44,345 --> 00:54:45,930
Stone!

507
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,515
Go!

508
00:54:49,308 --> 00:54:51,185
Stone!

509
00:54:52,311 --> 00:54:53,604
I'm okay.

510
00:54:55,189 --> 00:54:57,191
You thugs!

511
00:55:11,414 --> 00:55:13,624
You all right?

512
00:55:13,875 --> 00:55:16,711
Yeah. There he is! Go get him!

513
00:55:29,390 --> 00:55:33,436
All right!
Enough of this running shit!

514
00:55:33,686 --> 00:55:37,356
Well, Georgie-boy!
Well, what have we got here?

515
00:55:38,524 --> 00:55:40,568
Hello.

516
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:04,193
All right! Drop the gun!

517
00:57:04,402 --> 00:57:06,863
Put your hands in the air,
you're under arrest.

518
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:09,991
I said, drop it!

519
00:57:11,909 --> 00:57:13,452
Stop!

520
00:57:18,457 --> 00:57:21,711
God, didn't ya hear what I said?!

521
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,046
What are you, deaf?!

522
00:57:25,339 --> 00:57:27,341
What is this, a game?!

523
00:57:53,075 --> 00:57:55,369
Here. Sit down.

524
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:06,839
Stone's gonna be all right.

525
00:58:07,089 --> 00:58:10,009
I got the fellow with the satchel.

526
00:58:16,682 --> 00:58:19,018
- I had to kill him.
- Oh, yeah.

527
00:58:19,268 --> 00:58:22,104
He's as dead as Julius Caesar.

528
00:58:23,439 --> 00:58:27,068
- Would you rather it was you?
- No, I would not.

529
00:58:27,318 --> 00:58:31,864
Well, then you've done your duty.
Go home and sleep well tonight.

530
00:58:32,114 --> 00:58:35,368
The things you see
when you're out without your gun.

531
00:58:35,576 --> 00:58:39,205
Now you're a long way
from the Southside, George.

532
00:58:39,455 --> 00:58:43,084
I'm talkin' to you. Did you come
here to open a shooting gallery?

533
00:58:43,334 --> 00:58:46,671
I want you to write down the names
of your superiors and contacts.

534
00:58:46,921 --> 00:58:49,924
Why don't you kiss my ass?

535
00:58:50,132 --> 00:58:52,301
- Perhaps you didn't hear me.
- Eliot?

536
00:58:52,552 --> 00:58:54,595
- You've broken the law ...
- Eliot!

537
00:58:54,846 --> 00:58:56,848
You can be tough in Leavenworth
for 30 years.

538
00:58:57,098 --> 00:59:00,101
- You're going inside for all day!
- Is that what you want?

539
00:59:00,351 --> 00:59:03,104
- Eliot!
- What?!

540
00:59:03,312 --> 00:59:05,648
Look at this!

541
00:59:05,898 --> 00:59:08,734
- Look at this!
- What is this?

542
00:59:10,945 --> 00:59:12,738
What is this?

543
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:17,285
You got a lot of money changing
hands in this book.

544
00:59:17,535 --> 00:59:21,747
What is this, 'war'?
And 'police precincts'?

545
00:59:23,457 --> 00:59:26,794
And you got a heading here ...
'Circuit Court'.

546
00:59:27,003 --> 00:59:30,631
You got a heading here,
'Circuit Court'. What is this?

547
00:59:30,882 --> 00:59:33,801
Nothin'. There's nothin'
you can make out of it.

548
00:59:34,051 --> 00:59:37,388
If any of these coded entries
indicate payment to Capone,

549
00:59:37,597 --> 00:59:39,390
then we can put Capone away.

550
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,269
- Which entry is Al Capone?
- A. Costa, is that his code name?

551
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:46,272
You'll do the whole thing
in the joint unless you help us.

552
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,900
Translate this ledger for us!

553
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:50,693
- In hell.
- In hell?!

554
00:59:52,069 --> 00:59:55,615
You will hang high
unless you cooperate.

555
00:59:55,865 --> 00:59:59,452
This man can finger Al Capone,
put him behind bars.

556
00:59:59,702 --> 01:00:01,412
Why don't you guys just fuck off?!

557
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:08,085
I'm not fuckin' with you! We'll have
that information one way or another.

558
01:00:08,294 --> 01:00:10,213
- Not that way. Out.
- You're gonna talk!

559
01:00:10,463 --> 01:00:13,216
You're gonna be beggin' to talk!

560
01:00:13,466 --> 01:00:16,552
- You dirty son-of-a-bitch!
- Enough out of you.

561
01:00:20,348 --> 01:00:22,642
Hey, come on, you, on your feet!

562
01:00:22,850 --> 01:00:26,187
I need you to help me
to translate this book!

563
01:00:26,395 --> 01:00:28,397
I'm not gonna ask you a second time.

564
01:00:28,606 --> 01:00:30,775
I'm gonna count to three.

565
01:00:32,693 --> 01:00:36,239
What's the matter? Can't you talk
with a gun in your mouth?

566
01:00:38,324 --> 01:00:39,659
One.

567
01:00:43,913 --> 01:00:45,790
Two!

568
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:49,252
Three.

569
01:00:50,336 --> 01:00:51,796
I'm gonna talk!

570
01:00:52,004 --> 01:00:56,592
Don't! I'm gonna tell ya whatever
ya want. What do ya want to know?

571
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:03,474
Now, don't let him clean himself
until after he talks.

572
01:01:03,683 --> 01:01:06,727
Now, ask him what you want to know.

573
01:01:06,978 --> 01:01:11,107
All right ... Okay, I want to know
the name of the bookkeeper.

574
01:01:11,357 --> 01:01:15,486
I want a complete translation
of the code. I want a complete ...

575
01:01:15,695 --> 01:01:18,155
Mister Ness!

576
01:01:24,287 --> 01:01:26,581
I do not approve of your methods!

577
01:01:27,748 --> 01:01:32,461
Yeah? Well, you're not from Chicago.

578
01:01:36,632 --> 01:01:38,926
- What?
- They got the shipment.

579
01:01:39,135 --> 01:01:41,679
- What?!
- They got the whole shipment.

580
01:01:41,888 --> 01:01:45,850
- I want that son-of-a-bitch dead!
- We're trying to locate ...

581
01:01:46,058 --> 01:01:51,981
What am I, alone in this world? Did I
ask you what you're tryin' to do?

582
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:56,777
I want you to get this fuck where he
breathes! I want Eliot Ness dead!

583
01:01:56,986 --> 01:02:00,198
I want his family dead,
his house burnt to the ground!

584
01:02:00,406 --> 01:02:02,700
I want to piss on his ashes!

585
01:02:02,909 --> 01:02:08,164
Look at this guy, this guy,
he's so serious.

586
01:02:08,372 --> 01:02:11,626
- Well, he's got a lot on his mind.
- He does?

587
01:02:11,834 --> 01:02:13,794
- Yes.
- Like what?

588
01:02:15,338 --> 01:02:17,006
Like what his name is.

589
01:02:17,215 --> 01:02:21,385
John, I thought that was all settled.
I thought we liked John.

590
01:02:21,594 --> 01:02:24,096
I suppose his middle name
will be Law.

591
01:02:24,847 --> 01:02:28,184
No ... it'll be Edgar.

592
01:02:29,685 --> 01:02:33,272
- It'll be J. Edgar ...
- I don't think so.

593
01:02:36,859 --> 01:02:39,237
God, you're beautiful.

594
01:02:41,072 --> 01:02:43,324
You should have seen us last night.

595
01:02:45,409 --> 01:02:48,538
I know. I should have been here.
I wanted to be here.

596
01:02:48,788 --> 01:02:52,041
I know. I understand, I do.

597
01:02:53,584 --> 01:02:56,462
Just tell me, are you being careful?

598
01:02:56,671 --> 01:03:00,174
- Careful as mice.
- Are you making progress?

599
01:03:00,383 --> 01:03:02,510
- Progress?
- Yes?

600
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,931
Mrs. Ness, I think your husband
just became the man who got Al Capone.

601
01:03:15,565 --> 01:03:20,069
Gentlemen! A subpoena was issued
for Alphonse Capone ...

602
01:03:20,278 --> 01:03:25,199
by my office this morning,
for the crime of evading ...

603
01:03:25,408 --> 01:03:28,953
and conspiring to evade
Federal Income Tax.

604
01:03:29,162 --> 01:03:32,290
- What's the maximum he could get?
- If convicted on all counts,

605
01:03:32,498 --> 01:03:36,586
Mr. Capone could have
up to 28 years.

606
01:03:36,794 --> 01:03:39,964
Excuse me, that's all. Thank you.

607
01:03:46,512 --> 01:03:50,808
The car's in the yard. When ya get
him there, don't answer the phone.

608
01:03:51,017 --> 01:03:53,144
- We'll call, let it ring ...
- Twice.

609
01:03:53,352 --> 01:03:55,271
- We'll call ...
- From the corner.

610
01:03:55,479 --> 01:03:59,066
- Anybody knocks on the door ...
- Come out shooting. I got it.

611
01:03:59,275 --> 01:04:02,278
You enjoy the tactical aspects
of law enforcement, Oscar?

612
01:04:02,486 --> 01:04:05,281
Much more diverting
than accounting.

613
01:04:05,489 --> 01:04:07,658
I'm bein' good to you,
you got to be good to me.

614
01:04:07,867 --> 01:04:11,329
We made a deal,
we're gonna stick to it, okay?

615
01:04:16,792 --> 01:04:19,754
Oh, yes, much more diverting
than accounting.

616
01:04:20,004 --> 01:04:22,215
Okay, we see yous tonight.

617
01:04:22,465 --> 01:04:26,177
All right, all the way down
and no stops.

618
01:04:34,268 --> 01:04:37,939
he's been saying,
"I will speak up."

619
01:04:39,774 --> 01:04:43,903
For which I must commend
the excellent work ...

620
01:04:44,111 --> 01:04:47,782
of Eliot Ness
and his squad of Untouchables.

621
01:04:50,368 --> 01:04:52,745
- What was it, a boy or a girl?
- Boy.

622
01:04:52,954 --> 01:04:55,915
- Congratulations! What's his name?
- John.

623
01:04:56,123 --> 01:04:59,085
- John?
- Yeah. John James.

624
01:05:00,294 --> 01:05:02,672
- So she's okay?
- Yeah, she's okay.

625
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:06,342
In fact, when she gets out,
she wants to repaint the house.

626
01:05:06,551 --> 01:05:10,888
Then she'll find the house too small,
you'll have to move.

627
01:05:11,097 --> 01:05:16,394
- Goodness, it's nice to be married.
- If you can stand the pain.

628
01:05:16,602 --> 01:05:18,187
Mr. Burns, where's Mr. Wallace?

629
01:05:18,396 --> 01:05:23,901
Didn't you see him? He just went
down in the service elevator.

630
01:05:24,902 --> 01:05:28,948
- You keep an eye out at all times ...
- Take it easy, we'll be fine.

631
01:05:29,156 --> 01:05:31,617
They are going to ...

632
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:43,004
- Did he say the service elevator?
- Yes.

633
01:05:49,135 --> 01:05:52,513
- Wallace! Wallace!
- Here, let's take the stairs.

634
01:06:32,553 --> 01:06:34,889
Oh, no.

635
01:06:35,973 --> 01:06:39,060
- No, no!
- Easy ... Easy!

636
01:06:41,604 --> 01:06:43,105
Oscar.

637
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:24,355
Oh, Jesus.

638
01:07:28,109 --> 01:07:30,862
You gonna be all right?

639
01:07:51,007 --> 01:07:56,179
It's always a crime when a young guy
goes down in the line, Jimmy.

640
01:07:57,263 --> 01:08:00,391
I'd hate to see it happen
to someone I know.

641
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:04,228
Sometimes it's better
not to get involved.

642
01:08:04,437 --> 01:08:06,564
Jimmy!

643
01:08:06,772 --> 01:08:10,443
Take a day off.
Get out of the city for a while.

644
01:08:10,651 --> 01:08:12,695
You know what I mean?

645
01:08:29,795 --> 01:08:31,714
- Al Capone.
- We have no Mr. Capone ...

646
01:08:31,923 --> 01:08:35,426
- I know, get him.
- We have no Mr. Capone ...

647
01:08:35,885 --> 01:08:37,512
I said ...

648
01:08:44,143 --> 01:08:47,438
- Something you want here?
- My friend was killed today.

649
01:08:47,647 --> 01:08:50,399
- I don't care.
- You don't care.

650
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:55,613
Now he does.

651
01:08:55,821 --> 01:09:00,159
Come on here, Capone. You want
to fight? You and me, right here?

652
01:09:00,368 --> 01:09:01,702
That's it, come on!

653
01:09:01,911 --> 01:09:05,498
You afraid to come out from behind
your men, to stand up for yourself?

654
01:09:05,748 --> 01:09:09,710
- You want to do the mat now?
- Yeah! Come on, you son-of-a-bitch!

655
01:09:09,961 --> 01:09:11,796
- What?
- Easy.

656
01:09:12,046 --> 01:09:15,550
You talk to me like that in front
of my son? Fuck you and your family!

657
01:09:18,344 --> 01:09:21,514
Easy. It's me. It's me!

658
01:09:21,764 --> 01:09:23,474
Not this way.

659
01:09:23,683 --> 01:09:26,352
You fuck, you got nothin'!
You're nothin' but talk and a badge.

660
01:09:26,561 --> 01:09:32,275
You're here because you got nothin'
in court, no bookkeeper, nothin'!

661
01:09:32,483 --> 01:09:36,863
If you were a man, you would've done
it now! You got nothin', you punk!

662
01:09:46,289 --> 01:09:49,333
Well, no, I understand.

663
01:09:49,542 --> 01:09:52,420
Believe me, I understand.

664
01:09:59,844 --> 01:10:02,221
Well, what's happened?

665
01:10:03,681 --> 01:10:08,311
He says he can't be unprotected.

666
01:10:10,062 --> 01:10:12,732
What is it that the guy says?

667
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:15,568
He says he won't make
a fool out of himself,

668
01:10:15,776 --> 01:10:19,113
and he won't go into court
without a witness.

669
01:10:19,322 --> 01:10:23,576
So tomorrow morning the D.A. Will
announce that he's dropping the case.

670
01:10:23,784 --> 01:10:27,663
- He's gonna give up.
- He won't do it without a witness.

671
01:10:27,872 --> 01:10:30,541
We have Wallace's files
and the ledgers.

672
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:34,420
There's a time when I think
you have to cut your losses.

673
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:37,548
Hello?

674
01:10:39,592 --> 01:10:41,636
Hello.

675
01:10:43,262 --> 01:10:45,264
Yes.

676
01:10:48,601 --> 01:10:51,521
No, he didn't have a family.

677
01:10:53,981 --> 01:10:56,692
How is everything there?

678
01:10:59,946 --> 01:11:03,449
No, you do it however you want.

679
01:11:05,493 --> 01:11:07,745
I promise I will.

680
01:11:08,830 --> 01:11:11,165
You give her my love.

681
01:11:11,374 --> 01:11:13,417
I love you, too.

682
01:11:15,545 --> 01:11:20,716
Mr. Ness, we got a ledger here listing
payments to Chicago City officials.

683
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:24,887
- We got Al Capone, Frank Nitti ...
- I think that's enough for today.

684
01:11:25,096 --> 01:11:29,141
- If we don't stay on top ...
- That'll do. Thank you.

685
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:33,271
I'd like to request to stick around.

686
01:11:34,438 --> 01:11:37,024
- We got to bust these guys.
- I know we got to.

687
01:11:45,908 --> 01:11:47,994
Is that it?

688
01:11:49,078 --> 01:11:51,706
- I'm sorry?
- You heard me.

689
01:11:51,914 --> 01:11:54,375
My question is, are we done?

690
01:11:56,377 --> 01:11:58,754
Yes, I think we're done.

691
01:11:58,963 --> 01:12:01,841
So we sat in at a game
that was above our head?

692
01:12:02,049 --> 01:12:04,427
It appears so.
It appears so to Mr. Wallace.

693
01:12:04,635 --> 01:12:06,929
He's dead! And the D.A.
Is gonna drop the case!

694
01:12:07,138 --> 01:12:09,432
He will not go into court
without a witness ...

695
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:12,602
and without Capone's bookkeeper,
Walter Payne.

696
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:17,648
- What are you prepared to do now?
- What would you have me do?

697
01:12:17,899 --> 01:12:20,651
I have taken this
as far as it can go.

698
01:12:34,665 --> 01:12:38,753
- What did your wife want?
- She wanted to know if I was ...

699
01:12:39,837 --> 01:12:42,632
- My wife?
- Yeah.

700
01:12:46,594 --> 01:12:49,472
She wanted to know
if I was all right.

701
01:12:51,807 --> 01:12:54,143
It's nice being married, eh?

702
01:12:55,394 --> 01:12:56,729
Yes.

703
01:12:56,938 --> 01:13:00,233
She's sitting in some room surrounded
by people she doesn't know,

704
01:13:00,441 --> 01:13:04,737
going over ...
kitchen colour charts or something.

705
01:13:11,369 --> 01:13:17,083
Some part of the world still cares
what colour the kitchen is.

706
01:13:21,629 --> 01:13:25,925
Eliot, I want you to do
one more thing for me.

707
01:13:28,344 --> 01:13:31,889
Get back to the D.A. And stall him.

708
01:13:32,598 --> 01:13:36,769
- Wait a minute, stall him with what?
- Just do as I say.

709
01:13:40,189 --> 01:13:42,608
I think I know how to find this guy.

710
01:13:44,694 --> 01:13:47,446
Walter?

711
01:13:47,655 --> 01:13:52,660
Al says we got to get out of town
until he can fix this subpoena thing.

712
01:13:52,869 --> 01:13:55,830
We're leavin' tonight.

713
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:01,169
Two ball, down.

714
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:08,259
Mike, you got a minute?

715
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:11,137
I do now, don't I?

716
01:14:12,263 --> 01:14:15,558
And what are you doin'
in a club for cops, Jimmy?

717
01:14:16,517 --> 01:14:19,061
This is a place for cops.

718
01:14:19,312 --> 01:14:21,856
Can we step outside?

719
01:14:22,106 --> 01:14:26,444
All right, all right,
but I got nothin' to say to ya.

720
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:36,204
Where the hell are we going, for a
swim? Get out of the rain, you fool.

721
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:41,292
What? What?!

722
01:14:41,501 --> 01:14:44,587
I just need one more
piece of information.

723
01:14:44,795 --> 01:14:46,756
One more? Jimmy!

724
01:14:46,964 --> 01:14:52,011
- I just risked my life for ya.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

725
01:14:53,137 --> 01:14:59,101
Are you crazy? You're crazy.
I warned you to get out of town.

726
01:14:59,310 --> 01:15:03,314
- If they knew it was me, I'm dead.
- I need to find that bookkeeper.

727
01:15:03,523 --> 01:15:08,110
You're fuckin' nuts, man!
You're out of your fuckin' mind!

728
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:10,571
And I tried to save your life.

729
01:15:11,447 --> 01:15:16,035
Get your hands off. You owe me,
Jimmy, I don't owe you nothin'.

730
01:15:16,244 --> 01:15:19,413
- My people are being killed.
- We're your people!

731
01:15:19,622 --> 01:15:24,627
You?! You fuckin' run with the dagos!
They've ruined this town.

732
01:15:24,836 --> 01:15:29,048
For ten years I can't say that I'm
a cop for the shit that's goin' on!

733
01:15:29,298 --> 01:15:34,804
Ah, bullshit! Fuckin' bullshit!
Look at yourself! Look at yourself!

734
01:15:36,722 --> 01:15:42,311
Go on and live the charade, with your
soft clothes and federal stooges.

735
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,524
- What do you think he's gonna do?
- Keep your mouth off that!

736
01:15:46,732 --> 01:15:50,862
I need to know where this guy is,
and I need to know now!

737
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:55,116
I'm gonna rat you out for all the shit
that I know that you've done!

738
01:15:55,324 --> 01:15:57,869
I'm gonna turn you over!

739
01:15:58,077 --> 01:16:01,622
- This is a dead man talkin' to me.
- Is it?

740
01:16:03,791 --> 01:16:05,626
You're dead.

741
01:16:28,191 --> 01:16:29,901
Who the hell do ya think ya are?

742
01:16:30,109 --> 01:16:32,945
I'll have your ass hangin'
from the flagpole in the mornin'.

743
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:44,582
Let's cut the woofing, pal.
You tell me,

744
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:47,835
or you're going to hospital
or the fuckin' morgue!

745
01:16:48,044 --> 01:16:50,546
You're gonna fight it out
and we'll have a case.

746
01:16:50,755 --> 01:16:54,342
Yes? On what basis?
I'm not gonna make a fool ...

747
01:16:54,550 --> 01:16:57,178
Don't tell me about
makin' a fool out of yourself.

748
01:16:57,386 --> 01:16:59,972
I have men out there
risking more than that.

749
01:17:00,181 --> 01:17:02,683
We have a lead,
and we are following that lead ...

750
01:17:02,934 --> 01:17:07,855
at risk to more than our standing.
So don't you dare stop now.

751
01:17:09,941 --> 01:17:11,984
- Yeah, Stone.
- Give me Ness.

752
01:17:12,235 --> 01:17:13,778
He's at the D.A. 's.

753
01:17:14,028 --> 01:17:16,948
Tell him I know where Payne is
and to meet me at my place.

754
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:37,969
- Al! Al!
- Mr. Capone!

755
01:17:38,177 --> 01:17:42,598
- What about that court case?
- I'm gonna tell ya somethin'.

756
01:17:42,807 --> 01:17:46,936
Somebody messes with me,
I'm gonna mess with him.

757
01:17:48,020 --> 01:17:51,190
Somebody steals from me,
I'm gonna say 'you stole',

758
01:17:51,399 --> 01:17:54,652
not talk to him
for spittin' on the sidewalk.

759
01:17:54,861 --> 01:17:56,279
You understand?

760
01:17:57,113 --> 01:18:01,617
Now, I have done nothing
to hurt these people.

761
01:18:01,826 --> 01:18:04,579
But they're angered at me.
So what do they do?

762
01:18:04,787 --> 01:18:11,252
Doctor up some income tax, for which
they got no case, to annoy me.

763
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:14,088
To speak to me like men? No.

764
01:18:14,297 --> 01:18:17,216
To harass a peaceful man.

765
01:18:18,634 --> 01:18:20,678
I pray to God that
if I ever have a grievance,

766
01:18:20,887 --> 01:18:24,265
I would have
just a little more self respect.

767
01:18:27,602 --> 01:18:30,813
I'll tell you one more thing.
In an all-out prize fight,

768
01:18:31,022 --> 01:18:33,983
when one guy's left standing,
that's how you know who won.

769
01:21:21,692 --> 01:21:23,945
Isn't that just like a wop?

770
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:27,865
Brings a knife to a gun fight.

771
01:21:32,161 --> 01:21:34,705
Get out of here, ya dago bastard!

772
01:21:36,082 --> 01:21:38,209
Go on, get your ass out of here!

773
01:23:20,478 --> 01:23:22,230
Shots! Shots! I heard shots!

774
01:23:22,438 --> 01:23:26,067
Stay back, everybody stay back,
right now.

775
01:23:26,317 --> 01:23:27,693
Round the back.

776
01:23:37,286 --> 01:23:39,497
Malone!

777
01:23:42,375 --> 01:23:44,418
Malone.

778
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:14,282
Goddamn! Stone!

779
01:24:16,826 --> 01:24:18,995
Stone!

780
01:24:20,246 --> 01:24:22,623
The phone!

781
01:24:24,417 --> 01:24:27,295
Oh, God. Call an ambulance!

782
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:33,759
This is Stone, Treasury Department,
1634 Racine, we need an ambulance.

783
01:24:33,968 --> 01:24:36,888
- What?
- 1634 Racine!

784
01:24:37,388 --> 01:24:40,683
This? You want this?

785
01:24:44,854 --> 01:24:46,772
You want this?

786
01:24:53,779 --> 01:24:55,448
What?

787
01:25:02,622 --> 01:25:04,624
- Bookkeeper.
- What?

788
01:25:05,917 --> 01:25:07,919
- Book ...
- The bookkeeper?

789
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:11,339
- Bookkeeper!
- The bookkeeper? What?

790
01:25:12,548 --> 01:25:14,842
- The bookkeeper, he's on this train?
- Yes.

791
01:25:15,092 --> 01:25:17,136
He's on this train.

792
01:25:18,262 --> 01:25:21,766
Now! What are you prepared to do?!

793
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:27,230
No. Malone. No.

794
01:25:27,438 --> 01:25:30,191
Stay. Stay.

795
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:32,819
Stay! Malone ...

796
01:25:33,027 --> 01:25:35,071
No. No, no!

797
01:25:36,864 --> 01:25:40,368
Not this ... Not this man ...

798
01:26:06,102 --> 01:26:10,648
Train's leavin' for Miami
12:05, Mr. Ness.

799
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:14,402
We'll be there.

800
01:26:16,612 --> 01:26:19,991
The bookkeeper's no good to us dead.

801
01:26:20,199 --> 01:26:22,952
- Stone?
- Yes, sir.

802
01:26:33,504 --> 01:26:35,631
Cover the south entrance.

803
01:27:23,721 --> 01:27:26,891
We're almost home.
We're almost home.

804
01:27:29,393 --> 01:27:35,358
Your attention, please. The Miami
Flier departs at 12:05 from 33.

805
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:37,610
All aboard.

806
01:27:48,913 --> 01:27:52,041
Stay right there.
Stay right there.

807
01:27:53,125 --> 01:27:56,587
Stay right there.
Stay right there, honey.

808
01:28:08,516 --> 01:28:12,436
Your attention, please.
The Miami Flier, leaving at 12:05,

809
01:28:12,687 --> 01:28:16,566
now boarding on track 33.
All aboard!

810
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:33,249
Just here.
I'm just gonna leave this right here.

811
01:29:23,007 --> 01:29:28,095
Your attention, please.
The Miami Flier, leaving at 12:05,

812
01:29:28,304 --> 01:29:33,559
is now boarding on track 33.
All aboard!

813
01:29:33,768 --> 01:29:36,145
One more. Here we go.

814
01:29:58,668 --> 01:30:00,461
Here we go. You ready?

815
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:05,466
I'm right here, honey. Here we go.

816
01:30:06,884 --> 01:30:10,638
Your attention, please.
May I have your attention, please?

817
01:30:10,888 --> 01:30:13,432
This is the final call
for the Miami Flier,

818
01:30:13,683 --> 01:30:17,937
leaving at 12:05 on track 33.
All aboard!

819
01:30:57,268 --> 01:31:02,732
- Here, let me. Get your bags.
- Oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

820
01:31:02,940 --> 01:31:06,360
Are you all right? Thank you.

821
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:11,032
You're such a gentleman.
It's so kind of you to help me.

822
01:31:11,240 --> 01:31:15,244
I really wasn't sure
if we'd make it or not.

823
01:31:18,915 --> 01:31:21,834
Is there some problem
I can help you with?

824
01:31:22,084 --> 01:31:26,130
- No.
- I really can't thank you enough.

825
01:31:30,551 --> 01:31:34,305
Isn't this fun? You're being
such a good boy, sweetheart.

826
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:39,810
Thank you again,
this is so wonderful.

827
01:31:41,771 --> 01:31:43,898
Thank you, sir.

828
01:31:52,532 --> 01:31:56,202
Please, let me take it from here.
You've been such a great help.

829
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:59,497
Thank you so much.
We're almost there.

830
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:07,129
I'll take it from here, sir.
Thank you very much for your help.

831
01:32:09,298 --> 01:32:12,927
Don't cry, sweetheart.
We're almost home.

832
01:32:14,136 --> 01:32:16,347
Is something wrong?

833
01:32:17,598 --> 01:32:18,933
Sir?

834
01:34:14,841 --> 01:34:17,468
Come on!
Come on, let's get out of here.

835
01:34:18,261 --> 01:34:21,806
- What are you doin'?
- Shut up!

836
01:34:25,309 --> 01:34:27,854
- What are you doin'?
- Shut the fuck up!

837
01:34:28,062 --> 01:34:31,399
- Hold it!
- Please ...

838
01:34:31,607 --> 01:34:34,235
- My baby!
- Stay there. He's all right.

839
01:34:36,988 --> 01:34:38,781
I said hold it!

840
01:34:40,158 --> 01:34:42,743
I'm walkin' out with the bookkeeper.

841
01:34:42,994 --> 01:34:45,913
The bookkeeper and me
are drivin' away.

842
01:34:48,583 --> 01:34:50,793
See? Or else he dies.

843
01:34:51,002 --> 01:34:54,046
He dies, and you ain't got nothin'.

844
01:34:57,466 --> 01:35:00,678
You got five seconds
to make up your mind.

845
01:35:01,429 --> 01:35:06,434
- I'll tell ya what ya want to know!
- Shut up! I'm not kiddin'!

846
01:35:06,642 --> 01:35:11,063
He's crazy! Don't let him do this,
I'll tell you what you want to know!

847
01:35:11,272 --> 01:35:13,774
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him.

848
01:35:18,821 --> 01:35:20,865
- One!
- Will you stop it!

849
01:35:27,413 --> 01:35:29,415
Take him.

850
01:35:31,042 --> 01:35:33,544
Two.

851
01:35:59,695 --> 01:36:02,365
The two coded entries
in this ledger ...

852
01:36:02,573 --> 01:36:07,245
represent cash disbursement
to all levels of city officials,

853
01:36:07,453 --> 01:36:13,125
members of the police
and to Alphonse Capone.

854
01:36:15,127 --> 01:36:17,964
- That's correct.
- Excuse me?

855
01:36:19,549 --> 01:36:21,801
I said that is correct.

856
01:36:22,051 --> 01:36:26,848
And you will decipher
these coded entries for us?

857
01:36:29,058 --> 01:36:31,185
I will.

858
01:36:31,394 --> 01:36:33,729
Sorry, Mr. Payne, I can't hear you.

859
01:36:33,938 --> 01:36:36,732
I said, I will.

860
01:36:36,941 --> 01:36:41,654
You were in charge
of disbursements for Mr. Capone?

861
01:36:41,863 --> 01:36:43,197
Yes, I was.

862
01:36:43,406 --> 01:36:46,450
And you personally
distributed monies ...

863
01:36:46,659 --> 01:36:50,705
vast, undeclared monies ...

864
01:36:50,913 --> 01:36:54,250
to Mr. Capone?

865
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:56,836
Yes, I did.

866
01:36:57,044 --> 01:36:59,881
Would you tell us the amounts?

867
01:37:01,299 --> 01:37:07,430
In a three-year period I personally
disbursed monies to Mr. Capone ...

868
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:12,560
in excess of one
and a third million dollars.

869
01:37:15,354 --> 01:37:18,232
Would you repeat that amount, please?

870
01:37:19,317 --> 01:37:25,072
- One and a third million dollars.
- Thank you very much.

871
01:37:40,505 --> 01:37:43,716
I don't understand it.
What does Capone have?

872
01:37:43,966 --> 01:37:48,095
We're nailing the lid on his coffin,
and he's smiling.

873
01:38:11,202 --> 01:38:14,497
The son-of-a-bitch
is wearing a gun in court.

874
01:38:17,416 --> 01:38:20,127
Get me the bailiff.

875
01:38:21,754 --> 01:38:23,130
It'll be a fast trial.

876
01:38:26,926 --> 01:38:31,347
The man in the front row wearing
a white suit is carrying a gun.

877
01:38:31,556 --> 01:38:36,477
I don't want this to turn
into something. I'll lead you out.

878
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:46,404
Could we speak to you
a minute, please?

879
01:39:14,557 --> 01:39:19,562
- Get up against it.
- You heard him. Now, up against it!

880
01:39:20,605 --> 01:39:24,358
- What's this?
- Empty all your pockets, all of it.

881
01:39:24,609 --> 01:39:28,196
- I've got a permit for that.
- Fine, let's see it.

882
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:36,162
- I'm not the one under indictment.
- Everything on the table.

883
01:39:38,789 --> 01:39:41,000
- Let me see.
- Give him his gun back.

884
01:39:41,209 --> 01:39:43,461
"To Whom It May Concern.
Please extend to the bearer,"

885
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:47,507
"Mr. Frank Nitti, all possible
courtesy and consideration."

886
01:39:47,757 --> 01:39:50,176
"William Thompson,
Mayor of the City of Chicago."

887
01:39:50,384 --> 01:39:53,846
I'm sorry, Mr. Ness,
you'll have to give it back.

888
01:39:54,055 --> 01:39:58,017
Fine. But that man does not go
back into that courtroom.

889
01:39:58,226 --> 01:40:01,395
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, sir.

890
01:40:31,551 --> 01:40:36,848
1634 Racine ... You know, I used
to have a friend who lived there.

891
01:40:50,987 --> 01:40:53,614
Don't. Let him go.

892
01:40:57,285 --> 01:41:00,454
- No!
- Here, take it.

893
01:45:10,872 --> 01:45:16,210
Here I am, Treasury Man.
Come on! Harass me!

894
01:45:17,712 --> 01:45:19,964
What are you waitin' for?

895
01:45:21,048 --> 01:45:24,051
Don't just stand there!
Harass me!

896
01:45:28,055 --> 01:45:30,516
Don't push me.

897
01:45:33,186 --> 01:45:35,897
- They're gonna burn you, buddy.
- Yeah?

898
01:45:36,105 --> 01:45:39,233
Yeah. I'm gonna come see you burn,
you son-of-a-bitch!

899
01:45:39,442 --> 01:45:41,611
'Cause you killed my friend!

900
01:45:41,819 --> 01:45:45,448
- He died like a pig.
- What did you say?

901
01:45:45,698 --> 01:45:49,285
I said that your friend died
screaming like a stuck Irish pig.

902
01:45:49,535 --> 01:45:52,997
Now you think about that
when I beat the rap.

903
01:46:06,511 --> 01:46:09,222
Did he sound anything like that?

904
01:46:39,627 --> 01:46:42,547
One picture, come on, one picture.

905
01:46:45,132 --> 01:46:47,802
Mr. Ness, take a look at this.

906
01:46:49,387 --> 01:46:51,180
Mr. Ness?

907
01:46:52,807 --> 01:46:57,270
Mr. Ness, are you doin' okay?
I think you'd better see this.

908
01:46:58,354 --> 01:47:01,232
- What is it?
- That's the jury list, Mr. Ness.

909
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,234
They've been bribed.

910
01:47:03,442 --> 01:47:07,530
I got it out of Nitti's coat.
Where is Nitti?

911
01:47:09,073 --> 01:47:11,200
He's in the car.

912
01:47:30,011 --> 01:47:34,140
This constitutes no evidence.
I'm not about to allow ...

913
01:47:34,348 --> 01:47:40,021
Your Honour, the truth is that Capone
is a killer and he will go free.

914
01:47:40,271 --> 01:47:45,151
There is only one way to deal with
such men, and that is hunt them down.

915
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:49,447
I have. I have forsworn myself.
I have broken laws I swore to defend.

916
01:47:49,655 --> 01:47:54,285
I am content that I have done right.
That man must be stopped, you must ...

917
01:47:54,494 --> 01:47:57,914
I'll be the judge
of what I must do, Mr. Ness.

918
01:48:07,924 --> 01:48:10,510
Would you excuse us?

919
01:49:12,780 --> 01:49:14,574
- Bailiff.
- Yes, sir.

920
01:49:19,245 --> 01:49:22,039
I want you to go next door
to Judge Hoffman's Court,

921
01:49:22,248 --> 01:49:25,376
where they've just begun hearing
a divorce action.

922
01:49:25,585 --> 01:49:30,840
I want you to bring that jury in here
and take this jury to his court.

923
01:49:32,633 --> 01:49:36,304
- Are those instructions clear?
- Yes, sir, they're clear.

924
01:49:37,388 --> 01:49:38,931
What's he talking about?

925
01:49:40,808 --> 01:49:45,271
Bailiff, I want you
to switch the juries.

926
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:47,815
Your Honour, I object!

927
01:49:48,024 --> 01:49:49,984
Overruled.

928
01:49:53,988 --> 01:49:55,781
What did you tell him?

929
01:49:57,575 --> 01:50:00,828
I told him his name was
in the ledger, too.

930
01:50:02,163 --> 01:50:04,957
His name wasn't in the ledger!

931
01:50:05,166 --> 01:50:08,211
Wait a second! Is this the law?
What's goin' on here?

932
01:50:08,461 --> 01:50:09,921
- You're out of order.
- What's goin' on?

933
01:50:10,129 --> 01:50:13,466
- I think ...
- Do somethin' here.

934
01:50:13,674 --> 01:50:16,260
What do I look like to you?
Do somethin'!

935
01:50:16,844 --> 01:50:18,846
Order!

936
01:50:19,931 --> 01:50:24,185
Your Honour, we'd like to withdraw
our plea of Not Guilty,

937
01:50:24,393 --> 01:50:26,354
and enter a plea of Guilty.

938
01:50:29,941 --> 01:50:32,735
- Guilty?
- Order in the court!

939
01:50:32,985 --> 01:50:34,987
Order!

940
01:50:43,663 --> 01:50:46,833
Bailiff! Bailiff!

941
01:50:47,041 --> 01:50:49,502
Bailiff, clear the courtroom!

942
01:50:51,003 --> 01:50:52,338
Eliot!

943
01:50:52,547 --> 01:50:55,716
Your Honour!
Is that justice?

944
01:50:55,925 --> 01:50:58,594
Please, why did he switch the jury?

945
01:50:58,803 --> 01:51:01,389
Are you gonna go
after the organisation?

946
01:51:01,597 --> 01:51:03,057
Excuse me.

947
01:51:04,350 --> 01:51:07,645
I'm askin' Your Honour,
is this justice?

948
01:51:12,483 --> 01:51:14,735
Is this justice?

949
01:51:17,613 --> 01:51:20,324
Never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

950
01:51:20,533 --> 01:51:22,034
What did you say?

951
01:51:22,243 --> 01:51:25,371
I said, never stop fighting
till the fight is done.

952
01:51:25,580 --> 01:51:27,623
- What?
- You heard me, Capone. It's over.

953
01:51:27,832 --> 01:51:30,376
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge.

954
01:51:30,585 --> 01:51:33,379
Here endeth the lesson.

955
01:51:33,588 --> 01:51:37,842
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

956
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:41,262
You're nothin'
but a lot of talk and a badge!

957
01:52:59,423 --> 01:53:01,592
So much violence.

958
01:54:07,825 --> 01:54:10,244
Cleaning up a little.

959
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:21,923
I guess this is goodbye.

960
01:54:23,257 --> 01:54:24,842
Goodbye, George.

961
01:54:27,470 --> 01:54:30,556
I want to ... thank you for this.

962
01:54:31,641 --> 01:54:33,434
No. Thank you.

963
01:54:49,325 --> 01:54:53,955
Mr. Ness ... I think he would have
wanted you to have that.

964
01:54:54,163 --> 01:54:57,250
He'd have wanted a cop to have it.

965
01:55:00,878 --> 01:55:03,464
I'm going home.

966
01:55:14,392 --> 01:55:17,019
Mr. Ness!
Any comment for the record?

967
01:55:17,228 --> 01:55:19,939
'The man who put
Al Capone on the spot.'

968
01:55:20,106 --> 01:55:22,692
I just happened to be there
when the wheel went round.

969
01:55:22,942 --> 01:55:25,945
They say they're going
to repeal prohibition.

970
01:55:26,154 --> 01:55:29,240
- What will you do then?
- I think I'll have a drink.

1
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:23,939
We've become bored with watching
actors give us phony emotions.

2
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,402
We're tired of pyrotechnics
and special effects.

3
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:33,782
While the world he inhabits is,
in some respects, counterfeit,

4
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,661
there's nothing fake about
Truman himself.

5
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,956
No scripts, no cue cards.

6
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,793
It isn't always Shakespeare,
but it's genuine.

7
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:46,962
It's a life.

8
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,760
I'm not going to make it.

9
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,971
You're going to have to go on
without me.

10
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,811
No way, mister.

11
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:07,483
You're going to the top of this mountain,
broken legs and all.

12
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:15,157
We find many viewers leave him on
all night for comfort.

13
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,161
You're crazy, you know that?

14
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:26,585
For me, there is no difference
between a private life and a public life.

15
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:30,005
My life, is my life, is The Truman Show.

16
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,424
The Truman Show is a lifestyle.

17
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:34,843
It's a noble life. It is...

18
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,306
...a truly blessed life.

19
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,017
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

20
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,146
All right. Promise me one thing, though.

21
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:49,441
If I die before I reach the summit,

22
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,487
you'll use me
as an alternative source of food.

23
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,656
Gross.

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,370
It's all true. It's all real.

25
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,290
Nothing here is fake.
Nothing you see on this show is fake.

26
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,042
It's merely controlled.

27
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,262
Eat me, damn it. That's an order.

28
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,392
Maybe just your love handles.

29
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,938
I have love handles? Yeah. Little ones.

30
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,691
Truman. You're going to be late.

31
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,943
Okay!

32
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,959
- Good morning.
- Morning.

33
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,210
Good morning.

34
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,590
In case I don't see you, good afternoon,
good evening, and good night.

35
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,842
Yeah.

36
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,844
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer.

37
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,721
Hey, Pluto. No, get down.

38
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,556
- He won't hurt you.
- Get down.

39
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,183
I know.

40
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,560
- It's just me.
- Come on, Pluto.

41
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,125
What is it?

42
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:55,525
Here's a news flash just in. An aircraft
in trouble began shedding parts

43
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,695
as it flew over Seahaven
just a few moments ago.

44
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,489
Luckily, no one was hurt.

45
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,658
But, hey, how do you feel today?

46
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,077
That's good.
You thinking of flying somewhere?

47
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,703
- Nope.
- No? Good.

48
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:08,872
This is Classical Clive
with Classical Drive

49
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,291
so why don't you forget
about the perils of fiying,

50
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,378
settle back,
and let this music calm you down?

51
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,176
- Dog Fancy, please.
- Dog Fancy.

52
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,096
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

53
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,015
Give me a paper there, will you, Earl?

54
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,060
And one of these for the wife.

55
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,937
Loves her fashion mags.

56
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,563
Will that be all for you, Truman?

57
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,024
- That's the whole kit and caboodle.
- Catch you later.

58
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,151
Okay. Yeah.

59
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,660
Good morning.

60
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,830
- Hank.
- Morning, Truman.

61
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:53,375
- Good morning, Truman.
- How are you guys?

62
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,711
- Beautiful day, isn't it?
- Always.

63
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,421
And how's your lovely wife?

64
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,424
Good. How about yours?

65
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,010
- Couldn't be better.
- Fine.

66
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,928
- Nice talking to you, Truman.
- You, too.

67
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,138
We must go now.

68
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,850
Think about that policy. Okay,
that's two for one. That's a good deal.

69
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,144
- Doppelgnger special.
- Right.

70
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:13,395
Hi.

71
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,608
Hey, fellows. You going in? Go ahead.

72
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,987
- Go ahead.
- No, you first, please.

73
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,239
I'm not that anxious to get there.

74
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,380
Yes, hello.

75
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:44,009
Could I have directory assistance
for Fiji, please? Fiji islands.

76
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:45,510
Truman, did you see this?

77
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,473
I'm sorry, ma'am.

78
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,559
If he's in a coma,
he's probably uninsurable.

79
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,688
Hello? Yes. Fiji, please.

80
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,858
Do you have a listing for
Lauren Garland?

81
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,611
Nothing listed?

82
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,782
Okay. Do you have a Sylvia Garland?

83
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,450
"S" for Sylvia.

84
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,161
Nothing?

85
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,748
Okay. Thank you.

86
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:52,536
- Lawrence.
- Hey, Burbank.

87
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,039
Got a prospect in Wells Park
I need you to close.

88
00:06:58,459 --> 00:06:59,835
Wells Park?

89
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,966
- On Harbor Island?
- You know another one?

90
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,886
I can't do it.
I have an appointment. Dentist.

91
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:16,059
You're going to lose a lot more than
your teeth if you don't meet your quota.

92
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,727
Look, Truman,

93
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:20,439
they're making cutbacks
at the end of this month.

94
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,024
- Cutbacks?
- Yeah. Now, you need this.

95
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:28,155
Besides, a half-hour across the bay,
a little sea air would do you good.

96
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,740
Thanks.

97
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,418
Hello.

98
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:44,671
Ferry's still here.
Thought I might have missed it.

99
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:46,673
One-way or return?

100
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,967
Return.

101
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,138
There you go, sir.

102
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:54,449
- Do you need any help, sir?
- You go ahead. I'll be fine.

103
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,285
Yeah.

104
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,133
Hi, honey.

105
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:16,304
Look what I got free at the checkout.

106
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,059
It's a Chef's Pal.
It's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in one.

107
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,895
Never needs sharpening,
dishwasher-safe.

108
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,980
Wow!

109
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,649
That's amazing.

110
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,068
Truman,

111
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,280
you missed a spot.

112
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:49,045
That is a beer.

113
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,717
You know, I'm thinking
about getting out, Marlon.

114
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,719
Yeah? Out of what?

115
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,346
Out of my job, out of Seahaven.

116
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,266
- Off this island. Out.
- Out of your job?

117
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,436
What the hell's wrong with your job?
You have a great job, Truman.

118
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,939
You have a desk job.
I'd kill for a desk job.

119
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,985
Here you go.

120
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,487
You should try stocking
vending machines for a living.

121
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,198
- No, thanks.
- Now there's excitement.

122
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,493
Don't you ever get antsy? Itchy feet?

123
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,830
Where's there to go?

124
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,791
Fiji.

125
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,837
Where the hell's Fiji? Near Florida?

126
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:37,802
- See here?
- Yeah.

127
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,346
This is us,

128
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,558
and all the way around here,

129
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,226
Fiji.

130
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,898
You can't get any further away
before you start coming back.

131
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,859
You know, there are still islands in Fiji

132
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:54,986
where no human being
has ever set foot.

133
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:00,367
So when are you going to go?

134
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,746
It's not that simple.

135
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,916
It takes money,

136
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,210
planning.

137
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:12,587
I can't just up and go.

138
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:14,589
Right.

139
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,218
I'm going to do it.
Don't worry about that.

140
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:21,513
Bonus time is just around the corner.

141
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:29,521
- You coming for a drink?
- No, I can't tonight.

142
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,419
I don't like the look of that weather, son.
I think we should head back.

143
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:55,046
- No, Dad. Not yet.
- No, come on. We should go back.

144
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,674
- A bit farther, please?
- Son, listen.

145
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,968
- Okay.
- Yes.

146
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,805
Daddy!

147
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,382
You're soaked. Where have you been?

148
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,676
I figure we can
scrape together $8,000...

149
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,136
Every time you and Marlon
get together...

150
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,305
We can bum around the world
for a year on that.

151
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,142
And then what, Truman?
We'd be where we were five years ago.

152
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,688
- You're talking like a teenager.
- Maybe I feel like a teenager.

153
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,733
We have mortgage payments, Truman.

154
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,401
We have car payments.

155
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:43,613
What, we're just going to walk away
from our financial obligations?

156
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:45,698
It would be an adventure.

157
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:50,829
I thought we were going to try for a
baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?

158
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:54,249
That can wait. I want to get away.

159
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,085
See some of the world, explore.

160
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:00,088
Honey, you want to be an explorer?

161
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,924
This'll pass.

162
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:06,553
We all think like this now and then.

163
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,766
Let's get you out of these wet clothes,

164
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,685
come to bed.

165
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,981
You never see anything anyway.
They always

166
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:20,984
turn the camera and play music and,

167
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:24,195
you know, the wind blows in,
and the curtains move

168
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,697
and you don't see anything.

169
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,954
- Dog Fancy, please.
- Dog Fancy.

170
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,540
Thank you.

171
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,586
- Paper, Earl, please.
- Paper.

172
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:44,549
I might as well pick one of these up
while I'm at it.

173
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,302
- For the wife?
- She's got to have them.

174
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,972
- Anything else, Truman?
- That's the whole ball of wax.

175
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,391
- Catch you later.
- Okay.

176
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,330
Dad?

177
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,376
What are you doing?

178
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,713
What the... Get out of the way!

179
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,340
Stop them!

180
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,510
Stop those people!

181
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,975
Open the doors!
Somebody, stop the bus!

182
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,187
Stop the bus! Somebody, stop it!

183
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,273
Somebody, stop the bus!

184
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,665
And wasn't it funny...

185
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,340
It doesn't sound insane at all, Truman.

186
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,302
I see him 10 times a week
in 100 different faces.

187
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,306
I almost hugged a perfect stranger
in the salon last Thursday.

188
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,977
It was Dad. I swear.
Dressed like a homeless man.

189
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,979
And you know what else was strange?

190
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,064
A businessman and a woman
with a little dog

191
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,775
came out of nowhere
and forced him onto a bus.

192
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,653
It's about time they cleaned up
the trash downtown

193
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,447
before we become
just like the rest of the country.

194
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:34,075
They never found Dad's body.
Maybe somehow...

195
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,159
God!

196
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,538
I'm telling you, if it wasn't him,
it was his twin.

197
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:44,043
- Did Dad have a brother?
- Truman, you know perfectly well

198
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:48,798
that your father was an only child,
just like you.

199
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,052
Now, sweetie,

200
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,889
you're just feeling bad
because of what happened.

201
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:01,102
You, sailing off into that storm.

202
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,774
But I've never blamed you, Truman,

203
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,944
and I don't blame you now.

204
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,408
Truman?

205
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:03,664
What are you doing down here?

206
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,793
Fixing the mower.

207
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,673
- Saw my father today.
- I know.

208
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,762
Your mother called.

209
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,391
You really shouldn't upset her like that.

210
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,061
Did you want... What did you want?

211
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,021
I made macaroni.

212
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,190
I'm not hungry.

213
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,653
You know, you really ought to throw out
that mower.

214
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,240
Get one of those new Elk Rotaries.

215
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,403
What's he doing?

216
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:18,489
See, they got rid of her,
but they couldn't erase the memory.

217
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,241
The memory of who?

218
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,296
- You okay? You all right?
- Excuse me. Hi.

219
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,632
- Hi.
- I'm so sorry I fell on you like that.

220
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,843
- It's okay.
- I've just been such a klutz all day.

221
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,428
It's all right.

222
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,556
Sprained this ankle. Oh, my goodness.
I'm so sorry.

223
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:29,518
- I'm so sorry to fall on you like that.
- That's all right. Don't worry about it.

224
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,979
- I'm Meryl.
- Hi, I'm Truman.

225
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,522
Hey, nice to meet you.

226
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:03,529
- Truman, you've studied enough.
- No. I got to commit this to memory.

227
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,573
Come on, Truman,
one ice-cold brewski.

228
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,907
Come on.

229
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,745
You're going to have to copy off me,
so be careful.

230
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,374
You're a better person than I am.

231
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,709
- See you later.
- Okay.

232
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,169
- Bye.
- Bye.

233
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,796
See you later, loser.

234
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,608
Hi.

235
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,408
- Konnichi-wa.
- What?

236
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,701
You take Japanese.

237
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,162
Yes.

238
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,750
Lauren, right?

239
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,460
It's on the...

240
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,672
Lauren. Right.

241
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,842
I'm Truman Burbank.

242
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,553
Yeah, I know.

243
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:54,098
You know, Truman,
I'm not allowed to talk to you.

244
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:55,391
Really?

245
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,814
Yeah. I can understand that.
I'm a pretty dangerous character.

246
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,108
I'm sorry. It's not up to me.

247
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,069
A girl's got to be careful.

248
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,033
- You have a boyfriend, right?
- No, it's not that.

249
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,662
Was it Meryl, that girl that was with me?
We're not... We don't...

250
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:19,165
We're just friends.

251
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,917
- It's nothing like that.
- It's how I look?

252
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,502
Not your type?

253
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,546
No.

254
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:28,549
I like your pin.

255
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,886
I was wondering that myself.

256
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,890
Would you want to maybe, possibly,

257
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,935
sometime go out
for some pizza or something?

258
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,645
Like, Friday?

259
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,106
- Saturday?
- I can't.

260
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,150
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?

261
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,240
- We have finals tomorrow.
- Yeah, I know.

262
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,911
If we don't go now, it won't happen.

263
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:01,457
Do you understand?
So what do you want to do?

264
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,619
Please keep your hands inside the car!

265
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,389
This is my favorite pizza place.

266
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,515
Tony!

267
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,642
One large, extra plankton.

268
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,771
We have so little time.
They're going to be here any minute.

269
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:08,816
- Who are?
- They don't want me talking to you.

270
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,943
Then don't talk.

271
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,667
They're here.

272
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,503
- Truman.
- What do they want?

273
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,714
Listen to me.
Everybody knows about you.

274
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,507
Everybody knows everything you do.

275
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,593
They're pretending, Truman.
Do you understand?

276
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,261
- Everybody's pretending.
- I don't know.

277
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:39,263
No, my name's not Lauren. It's Sylvia.

278
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:40,639
- My name's Sylvia.
- Sylvia?

279
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:43,100
- Yeah.
- Lauren, sweetheart, not again.

280
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:46,103
- Wait a minute. Who are you?
- I'm her father.

281
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,106
- I've never even seen him before.
- We weren't doing anything.

282
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,942
He's lying.
Truman, please don't listen to him.

283
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:56,780
Everything I've told you is the truth.
This, it's fake. It's all for you.

284
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,700
- I don't understand.
- The sky and sea, everything, it's a set.

285
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,784
It's a show.

286
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,245
Everybody's watching you.
Please don't listen to him.

287
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,456
He's going to lie to you.
They're watching us now.

288
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,542
- I want to know what's going on.
- Schizophrenia. She has episodes.

289
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:09,960
We've tried everything.

290
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,380
Hypnotism, shock therapy. Don't worry.

291
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,507
- Truman!
- You're not the first.

292
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,969
You're not the first. She brings
all her boyfriends down here.

293
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,639
What's he saying? Truman, he's lying.

294
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,892
- Get out of here. Come and find me.
- Don't worry.

295
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:28,437
We're going to Fiji.
Fiji. We're moving to Fiji.

296
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:29,605
Fiji?

297
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,785
Sylvia!

298
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,869
Hey!

299
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:55,923
Why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?

300
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:00,469
His mother got sick, really sick.
He couldn't leave her. He's kind.

301
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,304
Maybe he's too kind.

302
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:05,516
I can't believe he married Meryl
on the rebound.

303
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,934
Excuse me.

304
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,310
Come on, Sal.

305
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:11,480
We've already got this
on the greatest hits tape.

306
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,606
Can I borrow that?

307
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,572
Close, but no cigar.

308
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,603
And it's another beautifui day
in paradise, folks,

309
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,439
but don't forget to buckle up
out there in radioland.

310
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,649
Remember, a good driver...

311
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,118
...wait for the cue.

312
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,413
Stand by, one.

313
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,832
Countdown to action.

314
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,459
Stand by, one.

315
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,507
He's heading west on Stewart.
Stand by, all extras.

316
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:05,928
He'll be on you in about 90 seconds.
Props, make sure the coffee's hot.

317
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,223
Okay, he's making his turn
onto Lancaster Square.

318
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,560
Oh, my God! He nearly hit her.

319
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,813
Something's wrong.
Change frequencies.

320
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,903
Sorry about that, folks.

321
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,322
I guess we picked up
a police frequency or something.

322
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,325
It sometimes happens,
and it can drive you crazy.

323
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,536
Okay, it's Classical Clive back in here

324
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,163
and we've still got
some great music up ahead,

325
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,498
but don't forget to buckle up.

326
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,209
Remember safety.
A good driver is a safe driver.

327
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,419
A safe driver is what? Yes...

328
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,937
Morning, ma'am.

329
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:39,039
- I love that idea.
- It's pretty cool, isn't it?

330
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:44,771
Can I help?

331
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,232
Yeah. I have an appointment
at Gable Enterprises.

332
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,775
They went bust.

333
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,991
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

334
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:59,202
- Just tell me what's happening.
- Got to go, sir. We're remodeling.

335
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,288
No, you're not.
What are those people doing?

336
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,081
It's none of your business!

337
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,625
If you don't tell me what's happening,
I'll report you!

338
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,461
You're trespassing.

339
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:39,951
Marlon.

340
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,246
- Truman. What are you doing here?
- I got to talk to you.

341
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,207
It's a bad time, okay? I'm way behind.

342
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,834
I'm onto something, Marlon.
Something big.

343
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,004
- You okay? You look like shit.
- I think I'm mixed up in something.

344
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,130
Mixed up in what?

345
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,965
There's no point trying to explain it,

346
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:57,177
but a lot of strange things
have been happening.

347
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:04,267
The people on the elevator.
There was no backing on it.

348
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,895
I looked out. There was people there.

349
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:10,190
And on the radio on the way to work,
it starts following me along,

350
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,983
talking about everything that I'm doing.

351
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:14,736
- Know what I mean?
- Truman, this is one of your fantasies...

352
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,238
I think this is about my dad.

353
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,532
- Your dad?
- I think he's alive.

354
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,411
Yeah. I'll tell you about it later.
I'm definitely being followed.

355
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:24,913
Who?

356
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:30,168
It's hard to tell.
They look just like regular people.

357
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:37,092
- How about those two?
- I don't know. Could be.

358
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:41,888
It's when I'm unpredictable, that's...
They can't, you know.

359
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,684
- Did anything happen?
- No.

360
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,978
We gotta get out of here.
You ready to go?

361
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,938
- No. I just came here.
- Come on.

362
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,731
I told you I can't.

363
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,904
You're going to get both our asses fired,
you know that?

364
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,157
- Okay, man, let's do it.
- What?

365
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,367
Whatever you say, I'm game.

366
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,953
- What are you talking about?
- Yes, sirree.

367
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,581
Your birthday comes but once a year.

368
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,253
Maybe I'm being set up for something.

369
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,505
You ever think about that, Marlon?

370
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,675
Like your whole life
has been building toward something?

371
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:19,759
No.

372
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,806
When you were hauling chickens
in the summer for Kaiser,

373
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,434
what was the furthest
you ever got off the island?

374
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,979
Went all over.
Never found a place like this, though.

375
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:35,317
Look at that sunset, Truman.
It's perfect.

376
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,277
Yeah.

377
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,988
That's the big guy.

378
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:43,909
- Quite a paintbrush he's got.
- Yep.

379
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,457
Just between you and me, Marlon,

380
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,127
I'm going away for a while.

381
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:57,631
- Really?
- Yeah.

382
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,092
Little angel.

383
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,142
My little clown.

384
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:12,938
Old carrot top.

385
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:15,315
The best of both of us.

386
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,653
We should be
getting you home, Mother.

387
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:23,198
Hold on a minute.
Here's us at Mt. Rushmore.

388
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,575
Do you remember, Truman,
when Dad was still with us?

389
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,120
That was quite a drive.
You slept the whole way there.

390
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,498
It looks so small.

391
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,833
Things always do
when you look back, darling.

392
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,377
Look, Truman.

393
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,255
The happiest day of our lives. Look.

394
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,093
Jean, Jodie, Joanne.

395
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,679
Doesn't she look beautiful, Truman?

396
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,223
She still does.

397
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,017
And there's lots of pages left over
for baby photos.

398
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,688
I would like to hold a grandchild
in my arms before I go.

399
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,440
Angela, we really should
be getting you home.

400
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,026
- I'll take her.
- No. You stay, relax.

401
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,820
Enjoy yourself.
Your favorite show will be coming on.

402
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:02,946
You sure?

403
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,948
Besides, we have something
to discuss.

404
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:09,536
- A certain person's birthday.
- I see.

405
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,624
And there'll be another episode of
I Love Lucy same time tomorrow.

406
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,544
But right now,
it's time for Golden Oldies.

407
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,297
Tonight, we present
the enduring, much-loved classic,

408
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,465
Show Me the Way to Go Home.

409
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,759
A hymn of praise to small-town life,

410
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:27,137
where we learn
that you don't have to leave home

411
00:38:27,221 --> 00:38:31,850
to discover what the world's all about,
and that no one is poor who has friends.

412
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:36,855
Full of laughter and love, pain and
sadness, but ultimateiy redemption,

413
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,649
we share the trials and tribulations
of the Abbott family.

414
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,652
Note the touching performance
of Ronald Brierly as Uncle Bunny.

415
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,322
That scene with the bowl of cherries
is going to have you

416
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,325
splitting your sides
with laughter all over again.

417
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:52,370
And there'll be tears, too,
when David and Jennifer are reunited.

418
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:56,291
But enough from me.
Let's join the Abbotts in Camden village.

419
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:25,403
Thank you, sweetie.

420
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,619
I need to talk to you,
but let's go outside.

421
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:37,457
- Sweetie, I'd love to, but I'm really late.
- What's your rush?

422
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:39,876
Surgery.

423
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,421
There was that elevator disaster
downtown. It was on the news last night.

424
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,215
This cable just snapped.

425
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,842
This elevator,
it just plummeted down 10 flights.

426
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,387
The non-union workers. Just monsters.

427
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:53,098
That building, it's right next door
to where you work.

428
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:55,183
Can you imagine
if you had been in there?

429
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,810
It's not even worth thinking about.

430
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:59,813
Anyway, I have an amputation
on one of the young women

431
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:03,400
who was in that elevator.
She's very young. It's very sad.

432
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,945
- Anyway, wish me luck.
- I'll cross my fingers for you.

433
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:52,407
Excuse me. Hi. Excuse me.
May I help you?

434
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:58,204
Yes. I'm looking for my wife,
Nurse Burbank. It's very important.

435
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,666
I'm afraid that that's not possible.
She's in pre-op.

436
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,044
Sure. Okay, fine.

437
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:08,131
- Can you pass along a message?
- I'll try.

438
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,968
Can you tell her I had to go to Fiji,
and that I'll call her when I get there?

439
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,722
- When you get to Fiji?
- You got it.

440
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:19,267
- Fine. I'll tell her.
- Thank you so much.

441
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,921
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

442
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,508
Here, let me help you with that.

443
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,180
He's here.

444
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:00,600
I know.

445
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,852
Scalpel.

446
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:13,196
I'm now making my primary incision

447
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,866
just above the right knee.

448
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,870
Hold her.

449
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,331
Nicely done.

450
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:26,709
This isn't going to be pretty.
Unless you're family...

451
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,295
It's just beautiful. Beautiful job.

452
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,800
I'll just let someone else tidy up here.

453
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,827
- I'm sorry to keep you.
- That's okay.

454
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:06,666
- How can I help?
- I would like to book a flight to Fiji.

455
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,045
When would you like to leave?

456
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,172
Today.

457
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,569
I'm sorry. I don't have anything
for at least a month.

458
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,530
- A month?
- It's the busy season.

459
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:41,951
You want to book the flight?

460
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:46,497
It doesn't matter.
I'll make other arrangements, okay?

461
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,629
Last call for Chicago!

462
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,381
All aboard!

463
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,846
Thank you.

464
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,726
Windy city, here we come.

465
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,063
- Hi.
- Hi.

466
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,401
Hello. Hi.

467
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,446
Sisters.

468
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,241
- Mom, isn't that...
- Face the front.

469
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,188
Everybody off. We've got a problem.

470
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,292
I'm sorry, son.

471
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,851
His father was from Chicago,
wasn't he?

472
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,813
No. His dentist was from Pensacola.
His father was from Des Moines.

473
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,982
But how come he wants to go
to Chicago?

474
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:38,693
He's not going to Chicago.
He's not going anywhere.

475
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,862
He has to have it out with Meryl.

476
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,004
Truman?

477
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:06,512
- Honey, are you okay?
- Get in.

478
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,392
Truman.

479
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:13,811
Look.

480
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,566
What?

481
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,361
I predict that in just a moment,

482
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:28,201
we will see a lady on a red bike,
followed by a man with flowers

483
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:32,205
and a Volkswagen Beetle
with a dented fender.

484
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,624
- Truman, please.
- Look.

485
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,631
Lady,

486
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,467
flowers,

487
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:47,762
and...

488
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:53,142
- Truman, this is silly.
- There it is!

489
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,561
There's that dented Beetle! Yes!

490
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,571
Don't you want to know how I did that?
I'll tell you.

491
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,074
They're on a loop.
They go around the block.

492
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,994
They come back. They go around again.
They just go round and round.

493
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,454
Round and round.

494
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,873
I invited Rita and Marlon
for a barbecue on Sunday.

495
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,417
- I'm gonna make my potato salad.
- I won't be here Sunday.

496
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,461
I need you to remind me
we need more charcoal.

497
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:23,422
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

498
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:28,928
You're upset because
you want to go to Fiji. Is that it?

499
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,807
Okay, go.

500
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:38,771
I think you should save for
a few months, and then go.

501
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,607
There. Are you happy now?

502
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:43,776
I'm going to go take a shower.

503
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,864
Let's go now.

504
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,992
I'm ready to go now. Why wait?
Early bird gathers no moss.

505
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:53,703
Rolling stone catches the worm, right?

506
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,874
Truman, what are you doing?

507
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:03,212
Truman!

508
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:07,133
Where shall we go?

509
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,720
- Truman, where are we going?
- I don't really know.

510
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:13,055
I guess I'm being spontaneous.

511
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,018
Somebody, help me!
I'm being spontaneous!

512
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,562
Forget Fiji.

513
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,565
- Can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?
- No.

514
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:28,863
- What about Atlantic City?
- No, you hate to gamble.

515
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:31,949
- That's right, I do, don't I?
- So why would you want to go there?

516
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:36,245
Because I never have.
That's why people go places, isn't it?

517
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,833
- Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
- Me, too.

518
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,636
Blocked at every turn.

519
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,639
Beautifully synchronized,
don't you agree?

520
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,725
- You're blaming me for the traffic?
- Should I?

521
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:08,110
Truman, let's go home.

522
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,239
You're right.
We could be stuck here for hours.

523
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,659
It could be like this
all the way to Atlantic City.

524
00:49:14,743 --> 00:49:16,243
Let's go back.

525
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:20,289
I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.

526
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:26,003
Can you please slow down?

527
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,297
Yes, I can.

528
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:33,594
- Truman, that's our turnoff.
- I changed my mind again.

529
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:37,098
What's New Orleans like
this time of year? Mardi Gras!

530
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:47,358
Look, Meryl, same road, no cars.

531
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:48,859
It's magic.

532
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,488
Look, you let me out.
You're not right in the head.

533
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,865
You want to destroy yourself,
you do it on your own.

534
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:57,076
I think I'd like a little company.

535
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:07,837
Truman, you knew this would happen.

536
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,966
You know you can't drive over water.

537
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,885
Let's go home where you'll feel safe.

538
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:19,598
- Give me your hand.
- Sweetie.

539
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:21,642
Drive.

540
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:23,436
Truman!

541
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,939
We shouldn't be doing this!
Truman, we're breaking the law!

542
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,733
- Oh, my!
- You can do it.

543
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,860
- Please, don't!
- You can make it.

544
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:32,486
Truman.

545
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,530
We're over.

546
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:37,950
- We're over the bridge.
- We're over?

547
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,578
- We're over the bridge.
- We're over.

548
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,210
Truman, what about that sign?

549
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:50,963
I'm sure they're exaggerating.
We'll be fine.

550
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,967
Exaggerating? Do you believe that?

551
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,011
- Truman, let's go back!
- Can't go back!

552
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:59,722
Oh, my! Truman, we're on fire!

553
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,223
- It's okay.
- We're on fire!

554
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,225
It's okay. It's just smoke.

555
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,852
- You okay?
- Yes.

556
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:07,063
- Want to do it again?
- No!

557
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,317
Truman, stop! Oh, God!

558
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,323
So what are we going to do for money
when we get to New Orleans?

559
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,367
I have my Seahaven bank card.

560
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,789
So what? We're just gonna eat
into our savings, is that it?

561
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,917
I'm going to have to call your mother
when we get there.

562
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:32,505
She's going to be worried sick. I don't
know how she's going to take this.

563
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,267
What now?

564
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,938
This is a red alert.

565
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:54,235
Truman, it looks like a leak at the plant.

566
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:56,445
Back up. Leak at the plant.

567
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,948
- We had to shut her down.
- Is there any way around?

568
00:51:59,032 --> 00:52:01,742
- Whole area's being evacuated.
- Is there anything I can do?

569
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,786
- No, ma'am.
- Thank you for your help.

570
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,538
You're welcome, Truman.

571
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,332
Truman.

572
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,711
Truman!

573
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,797
Truman, come back!

574
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,717
Stop him!

575
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,387
Truman!

576
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,556
Catch him on the left!

577
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,448
Stay away!

578
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,873
No.

579
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,419
...now in custody.

580
00:52:56,798 --> 00:53:00,593
Thank you both so much for your help.
I really appreciate it.

581
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,597
He's lucky to be alive, ma'am.
Next time, we'll have to file charges.

582
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,140
I understand.

583
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,601
- Thanks again.
- Good night.

584
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:29,038
Let me get you some help, Truman.

585
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,373
You're not well.

586
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,545
Why do you want to have a baby
with me?

587
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:39,381
You can't stand me.

588
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,425
That's not true.

589
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,807
Why don't you let me fix you
some of this new Mococoa drink?

590
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:52,144
All natural cocoa beans
from the upper slopes of Mt. Nicaragua.

591
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,979
No artificial sweeteners.

592
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,607
What the hell are you talking about?

593
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:58,984
Who are you talking to?

594
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,154
I've tasted other cocoas.
This is the best.

595
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,991
What the hell does this have to do
with anything?

596
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,786
Tell me what's happening!

597
00:54:08,954 --> 00:54:12,414
You're having a nervous breakdown,
that's what's happening.

598
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,708
You're part of this, aren't you?

599
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,879
- Truman.
- Meryl!

600
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,966
You are scaring me.

601
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:24,677
No. You're scaring me, Meryl.

602
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:28,889
What are you going to do? Dice me?
Slice me and peel me?

603
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:31,392
There are so many choices!

604
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:33,811
Do something!

605
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,188
What?

606
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,857
What did you say?

607
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:42,319
- Who were you talking to?
- Nothing. I didn't say anything.

608
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,071
I didn't say anything.

609
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:47,449
- You said "do something."
- No, I didn't. I wasn't talking to anybody.

610
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:50,911
- Talk to me!
- I don't know anything. Please stop.

611
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,579
Stay where you are.

612
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,249
Truman?

613
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:57,960
Truman.

614
00:54:58,586 --> 00:55:02,256
Oh, thank God!

615
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:10,180
How can anyone expect me to carry on
under these conditions?

616
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,474
It's unprofessional.

617
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,727
It's okay.

618
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:21,859
Everything's going to be okay.
It's all gonna be fine.

619
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:27,573
I don't know what to think, Marlon.

620
00:55:31,703 --> 00:55:33,912
Maybe I'm losing my mind, but...

621
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:41,587
It feels like the whole world
revolves around me somehow.

622
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,675
That's a lot of world for one man,
Truman.

623
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,929
Sure that's not wishful thinking?

624
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:54,391
You wishing you'd made something
more out of yourself?

625
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,436
Come on, who hasn't sat in the john,

626
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,230
had an imaginary interview
on Seahaven Tonight?

627
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:03,525
- Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
- This is different.

628
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:05,611
Everybody seems to be in on it.

629
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:13,452
I've been your best friend
since we were 7 years old, Truman.

630
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,746
The only way you and I
ever made it through school

631
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,457
was by cheating off each other's
test papers.

632
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,377
Jesus, they were identical.

633
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,881
But I always felt safe knowing that.

634
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,927
'Cause whatever the answer was,
we were right together,

635
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:31,970
and we were wrong together.

636
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,683
Remember that time I stayed up
with you all night in your tent

637
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,061
because you wanted to play North Pole?

638
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,230
And I got pneumonia?

639
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,650
You remember that?

640
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,986
You were out of school for
about a month.

641
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:57,162
You're the closest thing I ever had
to a brother, Truman.

642
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,295
I know that things

643
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:10,551
haven't really worked out for either of us
like we used to dream they would.

644
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:15,347
I know that feeling, when it's like
everything's slipping away

645
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,725
and you don't want to believe it,

646
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,062
so you look for answers
somewhere else, but...

647
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,070
The point is,

648
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,407
I'd gladly walk in front of traffic for you.

649
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:43,250
The point is, I would gladly
step in front of traffic for you, Truman.

650
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:47,671
And the last thing I'd ever do
is lie to you.

651
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,676
And the last thing that I would ever do

652
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:56,805
is lie to you.

653
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,060
I mean, think about it, Truman.

654
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:04,354
If everybody is in on it,

655
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,026
I'd have to be in on it, too.

656
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,245
I'm not in on it, Truman, because

657
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,040
there is no "it."

658
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,546
You were right about one thing, though.

659
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:31,590
What's that?

660
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,344
The thing that started all this.

661
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,570
Yep. I found him for you, Truman.

662
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,864
That's why I came by tonight.

663
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,117
I'm sure he's got quite a story to tell.

664
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,289
Go to him.

665
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,464
Easy on the fog.

666
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:16,176
Stand by, crane cam.

667
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,012
Crane cam.

668
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,355
Button cam 3.

669
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,953
I never stopped believing.

670
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:49,042
And wide, curb cam 8.

671
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,877
My son.

672
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,673
- Move in for a close-up?
- No.

673
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:58,093
Move back

674
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,721
and fade up music.

675
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:08,145
And now go in close.

676
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:11,315
Aii those years wasted.

677
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:16,862
I'ii make it up to you, son. I swear.

678
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,202
Dad.

679
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:26,705
Yes!

680
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,674
Bravo.

681
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:40,260
That will win the ratings period.

682
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,054
Congratulations.

683
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:44,222
Okay, everybody, quiet down.
Let's concentrate.

684
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,099
- Great television.
- That was good work.

685
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,977
Let's get some champagne up here.

686
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,520
Congratulations.

687
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,525
- Well done, Christof.
- It was brilliant. It just broke my heart.

688
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,864
- Well done, everyone!
- Bravo!

689
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,240
Congratulations.

690
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:23,595
1.7 billion were there for his birth.

691
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:31,019
220 countries tuned in for his first step.

692
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:34,481
The worid stood still for that stolen kiss.

693
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:37,109
And as he grew, so did the technology.

694
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,277
An entire human life

695
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,364
recorded on an intricate network
of hidden cameras

696
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:46,284
and broadcast iive and unedited,
24 hours a day,

697
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:49,454
seven days a week,
to an audience around the globe.

698
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,125
Coming to you now
from Seahaven Island,

699
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:56,586
enclosed in the largest studio
ever constructed,

700
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,922
and along with the Great Wall of China,

701
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:02,300
one of only two manmade structures
visible from space,

702
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,221
now in its 30th great year,

703
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:08,223
it's The Truman Show.

704
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,855
What a week it's been.
I don't know about you,

705
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:16,898
I was on pins and needles
the entire time.

706
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,152
Hello and good evening.
I'm your host Mike Michaelson,

707
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:21,611
and welcome to Trutalk.

708
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,197
Our forum for issues growing
out of the show.

709
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:26,867
But tonight,
something very special indeed.

710
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:31,246
A rare and exclusive interview
with the show's conceiver and creator.

711
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:35,292
So come with us now as we go live
to the lunar room

712
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:38,754
on the 221st floor
of the omni-cam ecosphere.

713
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:42,466
That's where we'll find the world's
greatest tele-visionary.

714
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:45,594
The designer and architect
of the world within a world

715
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,804
that is Seahaven Island: Christof.

716
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:52,100
Before we begin, I'd like to thank you
on behalf of our audience,

717
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,019
for granting this exclusive interview.

718
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,354
We know how demanding
your schedule is

719
01:02:56,439 --> 01:02:59,316
and we all know how jealously
you guard your privacy.

720
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:01,693
This, sir, is indeed an honor.

721
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:03,236
Don't mention it.

722
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:06,239
The catalyst for the recent
dramatic events on the show

723
01:03:06,324 --> 01:03:08,408
has been Truman's father, Kirk,

724
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:11,870
and his attempts to infiltrate the show.
But before we get into that,

725
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:14,623
I think it's worth noting
this is not the first time

726
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:18,043
someone from the outside
has attempted to reach Truman, is it?

727
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,003
We have had our close calls in the past.

728
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:23,173
Truman! It's television! Yes!

729
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:27,093
Yes! I did it! I'm on The Truman Show!

730
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,930
But there's never been anything
to compare with

731
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,973
this most recent breach in security.

732
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,227
The first intruder
to be a former cast member.

733
01:03:35,853 --> 01:03:36,978
A dead one at that.

734
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:40,649
Got to say, writing Kirk back in,
masterstroke.

735
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,610
Since Kirk started this whole crisis
in Truman's life,

736
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:46,988
I came to the conclusion that he was
the only one who could end it.

737
01:03:47,073 --> 01:03:48,198
Truman!

738
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,574
Truman, no!

739
01:03:50,576 --> 01:03:51,743
That's off-limits.

740
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:55,539
- Why? What's over there?
- Nothing. It's dangerous. That's all.

741
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,999
You've got to know
your limitations, Truman.

742
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:02,212
But let's remind viewers of exactly why
Dad was written out in the first place.

743
01:04:02,338 --> 01:04:05,674
As Truman grew up,
we were forced to manufacture ways

744
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:07,509
to keep him on the island.

745
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:10,512
I'd like to be an explorer,
like the great Magellan.

746
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,097
You're too late.

747
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:14,558
There's really nothing left to explore.

748
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,690
Finally, I came up with the concept
of Kirk's drowning.

749
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:24,901
Most effective. Truman's been
terrified of the water ever since.

750
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:27,821
When Kirk read the synopsis
for the Death At Sea episode,

751
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:31,366
he was disappointed, to say the least.

752
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:35,036
I'm sure that's what caused him
to break back onto the set.

753
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,456
But how do you intend to explain
his 22-year absence?

754
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,669
- Amnesia.
- Brilliant.

755
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:45,297
Let's take some viewer phone calls.

756
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,300
Charlotte, North Carolina,
you're on with Christof.

757
01:04:49,385 --> 01:04:50,844
Yeah, hi, Christof.

758
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:54,639
I was just wondering how many
cameras you got there in that town.

759
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:57,225
Somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000.

760
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:02,355
- That's a lot of cameras.
- Remember, we started with just one.

761
01:05:04,108 --> 01:05:06,151
He was curious from birth.

762
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:10,780
Premature by two weeks. It was almost
as if he couldn't wait to get started.

763
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,158
And his eagerness to leave
his mother's womb

764
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,744
was the very reason he was the one
who was selected.

765
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,538
In competition
with five other unwanted pregnancies,

766
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,416
the casting of a show,
determined by an air date,

767
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:23,835
Truman was the one who
arrived on cue.

768
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:31,509
Incidentally, I believe
Truman is the first child

769
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,095
to have been legally adopted
by a corporation.

770
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:35,305
That's correct.

771
01:05:35,389 --> 01:05:37,766
The show has generated
enormous revenues,

772
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:41,102
now equivalent to the gross national
product of a small country.

773
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,354
People forget it takes

774
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,148
the population of an entire country
to keep the show running.

775
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:48,902
Since the show is on 24 hours a day
without commercial interruption,

776
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:52,530
all those staggering revenues
are generated by product placement.

777
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,283
That's true.
Everything on the show is for sale.

778
01:05:55,368 --> 01:05:58,662
From the actors' wardrobe, food
products, to the very homes they live in.

779
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:01,081
All of it available in the Truman catalog

780
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:02,540
and operators are standing by.

781
01:06:02,625 --> 01:06:04,376
Christof, let me ask you.

782
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:08,046
Why do you think
that Truman has never come close

783
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:11,675
to discovering the true nature
of his world until now?

784
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:15,178
We accept the reality of the world
with which we are presented.

785
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:16,888
It's as simple as that.

786
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,140
The Hague for Christof.

787
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,434
Hello? The Hague?

788
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:26,523
All right, we've lost that call. Let's go
to Hollywood. You're on Trutalk.

789
01:06:26,607 --> 01:06:29,234
Hi, I'd just like to say one thing.

790
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:30,986
You're a liar and a manipulator.

791
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:33,363
And what you've done to Truman
is sick.

792
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:37,033
We remember this voice, don't we?

793
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:40,787
- How could we forget?
- Let's go to another call.

794
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:44,165
No. It's fine, Mike.

795
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,502
I love to reminisce
with former members of the cast.

796
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:50,005
Sylvia,

797
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,800
as you announced
so melodramatically to the world,

798
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:58,346
you think because you batted your eyes
at Truman once,

799
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,182
flirted with him,

800
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,810
stole a few minutes of airtime with him

801
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:07,063
to thrust yourself and your politics
into the limelight,

802
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:10,859
that you know him?
That you know what's right for him?

803
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,987
You really think you're in a position
to judge him?

804
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:16,197
What right do you have to take a baby

805
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,950
and turn his life
into some kind of mockery?

806
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:21,578
Don't you ever feel guilty?

807
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:27,000
I have given Truman a chance
to lead a normal life.

808
01:07:28,335 --> 01:07:31,379
The world, the place you live in,

809
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:33,882
is the sick place.

810
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:38,053
Seahaven is the way
the world should be.

811
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:41,848
He's not a perfermer. He's a prisoner.
Look at what you've done to him!

812
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,641
He could leave at any time.

813
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:46,394
If his was more than
just a vague ambition,

814
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:50,065
if he was absolutely determined
to discover the truth,

815
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:53,485
there's no way we could prevent him.

816
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,446
I think what distresses you,

817
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:00,658
really, caller, is that ultimately

818
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:05,538
Truman prefers his cell, as you call it.

819
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:07,665
That's where you're wrong.

820
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,919
You're so wrong,
and he'll prove you wrong.

821
01:08:11,337 --> 01:08:15,548
Aside from the heated comments
of a very vocal minority,

822
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:18,468
it's been
an overwhelmingly positive experience.

823
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:21,012
Yes. For Truman
and for the viewing public.

824
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,014
Christof, I can't thank you enough

825
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,558
for giving so generously
of your time tonight.

826
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:28,520
I think it's safe to say that
now that this crisis is behind us

827
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,271
and that Truman's back to his old self,

828
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,691
we can look forward
to some exciting new developments.

829
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:37,112
Mike, the big news is
that Meryl will be leaving Truman

830
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:38,780
in an upcoming episode.

831
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:41,533
And a new romantic interest
will be introduced.

832
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:46,538
I'm determined that television's first
on-air conception will still take place.

833
01:08:46,956 --> 01:08:50,959
Another television milestone
straight ahead. You heard it here first.

834
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:53,795
It has been a singular honor
and a pleasure, sir.

835
01:08:53,879 --> 01:08:56,464
- Christof, thank you.
- Thank you, Mike.

836
01:10:14,919 --> 01:10:16,544
- Simeon.
- What?

837
01:10:20,966 --> 01:10:22,508
Is he looking at us?

838
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,886
Jesus, do you think he knows?

839
01:10:26,305 --> 01:10:27,305
Hello?

840
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:29,349
Better call Christof.

841
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,476
Hello? Come in, Major Burbank.

842
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:44,656
Jesus.

843
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:51,913
- He's back to his old self.
- Thank God.

844
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:02,215
That's an unusual cat, my man.

845
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:10,348
I hereby proclaim this planet...

846
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,897
Trumania of the Burbank galaxy.

847
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:22,694
- Is he gonna go?
- Okay, hallway camera ready.

848
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:25,947
That one's for free.

849
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:27,991
Keep up with him,
'cause he'll move fast.

850
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:30,201
Stand by, all house cameras.

851
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:33,454
- Morning!
- Good morning.

852
01:11:33,622 --> 01:11:35,290
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

853
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:37,041
In case I don't see you...

854
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:39,669
Good afternoon, good evening,
and good night.

855
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:44,465
- Good afternoon...
- Good morning.

856
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,676
...evening and good night.

857
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:49,470
- Morning, Truman.
- Morning, Spencer.

858
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:51,848
- How's it going?
- Let me check.

859
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,183
Vital signs are good.

860
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:57,812
Pluto!

861
01:11:58,355 --> 01:11:59,981
Good morning, Truman.

862
01:12:00,065 --> 01:12:02,817
- Look who's here.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?

863
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,235
Every single day.

864
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:07,238
The policy, we've thought about it
and we're gonna take it.

865
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,614
- You're kidding?
- No!

866
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:11,451
Why don't we go up to my office
right now and we'll sign the papers?

867
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:14,162
Next week would be much better.

868
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:17,457
- All right. See you guys.
- Okay, bye now. See you next week.

869
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:20,209
- Give me something to look forward to.
- You got it.

870
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,003
See, this isn't about insurance.

871
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:26,591
This is about the great variable:
When will death occur?

872
01:12:26,925 --> 01:12:29,010
Could be a week, a month, a year.

873
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,304
Could be today.

874
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:35,850
"Sunbather, minding his own business,

875
01:12:36,685 --> 01:12:39,771
"stabbed in the heart by the tip
of a runaway beach umbrella."

876
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,398
No way to guard against
that kind of thing.

877
01:12:44,568 --> 01:12:46,027
Sorry, excuse me.

878
01:12:46,236 --> 01:12:48,529
Truman, this is Vivien.
Vivien, this is Truman.

879
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,948
The two of you are gonna be neighbors.

880
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,748
I guess what I'm saying is that life is

881
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:00,792
fragile.

882
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:04,170
- Vivien, your office.
- Sorry.

883
01:13:04,254 --> 01:13:07,298
What's that? I'm sorry.

884
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,467
You do?

885
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:13,304
Great. Let me take your information.

886
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:31,239
Ready, 2. Go to 2.

887
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:37,161
And back to medium.

888
01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:40,581
And wide.

889
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:51,342
I was just trying to train the kid to...

890
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,594
Never mind.

891
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:58,850
What's he doing in the basement?

892
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,644
He moved down there
after Meryl packed up and left.

893
01:14:01,728 --> 01:14:03,146
Why wasn't I told?

894
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,857
Any unpredictable behavior
has to be reported.

895
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,152
He's just sleeping, I thought.

896
01:14:09,236 --> 01:14:11,779
- This the best shot we've got?
- What's to see?

897
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:15,491
- What's on the clock cam?
- It's an obstruction.

898
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:19,745
- What happened down there?
- He was just tidying up his garbage.

899
01:14:20,747 --> 01:14:24,709
I was gonna call you, but halfway
through, he gave up, and he fell asleep.

900
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:28,254
I wanna check on the setups
for the insurance convention tomorrow.

901
01:14:28,338 --> 01:14:29,714
- Yes.
- Yeah.

902
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,049
Nice move.

903
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,393
There you go.

904
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:54,739
Isolate the audio.

905
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:58,075
Give me a close-up on his torso.

906
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,413
He's still breathing.

907
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,292
Where's Chloe? Call him.

908
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:09,754
- What do you want me to say?
- Tell him it's a wrong number.

909
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,800
What took you so long?

910
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,803
Just had to wait for it. They were busy.

911
01:15:18,722 --> 01:15:21,140
Here. What's going on?

912
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:23,726
I don't know. They're...

913
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:26,854
He came down into the room. He did
nothing but stand around for a while.

914
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:28,439
Shut up and watch it.

915
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,150
Then we went to night vision.

916
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:33,361
He's asleep.

917
01:15:34,988 --> 01:15:36,239
- There!
- What?

918
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,407
- Zoom in.
- On which?

919
01:15:38,742 --> 01:15:40,326
Under the chair there.

920
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,121
Enhance it.

921
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,168
- Is it...
- My God.

922
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:54,090
He couldn't have gone up the stairs.
He must still be in the room.

923
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:55,800
- Get Marlon over there.
- Right away.

924
01:16:11,483 --> 01:16:12,650
Truman!

925
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:14,819
Surprise party!

926
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:18,155
Come on, buddy.

927
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:21,534
I got a six-pack of cold brewskis
with our name on them.

928
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:23,953
Come on, pal. Come on, buddy.

929
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,041
Shit.

930
01:16:32,337 --> 01:16:34,839
Marlon, find him. He's still in the room.

931
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:41,137
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

932
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:43,014
That's good. Keep it light.

933
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:46,392
I know you're in here.
I'm gonna find you.

934
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,564
Check under the table.

935
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:54,609
The closet, behind you.

936
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,614
Huh.

937
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:02,408
Gee.

938
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,494
I wonder where he could possibly be.

939
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:15,671
The lawn cam, get me the lawn cam.

940
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:26,015
Don't look in the camera.
Say something. Keep it going.

941
01:17:26,099 --> 01:17:27,224
He's gone.

942
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,560
- Cut transmission!
- Cut transmission?

943
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:30,895
Cut it!

944
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:35,149
Jesus! God in heaven!

945
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:39,070
- Everything's black.
- Give me the phone.

946
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:54,126
I don't know where he is, but he's gone.

947
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:03,594
All right. We've got
every available extra looking for him.

948
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,973
The principals are helping out. The
crew, too. So every sector's covered.

949
01:18:08,642 --> 01:18:11,352
- What about prop cars?
- Yes, they've been accounted for.

950
01:18:11,436 --> 01:18:12,853
He has to be on foot.

951
01:18:12,938 --> 01:18:15,856
He has the world's most
recognizable face. He can't disappear.

952
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:52,810
Go.

953
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:57,314
Hunt him. Yeah. Go find him, Pluto.

954
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,108
Good dog!

955
01:18:59,192 --> 01:19:00,443
All this fuss.

956
01:19:01,278 --> 01:19:03,279
If he could just hear my voice.

957
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:05,448
Truman!

958
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,870
Let me try. Truman!

959
01:19:12,164 --> 01:19:13,998
It's me, Dad!

960
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:17,501
Let's talk.

961
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,671
Yeah, I know.

962
01:19:22,382 --> 01:19:24,300
Just about done with the square.

963
01:19:24,384 --> 01:19:26,969
Got to go back to Barrymore,
check the interiors.

964
01:19:27,053 --> 01:19:29,263
- He's got to be in there.
- Barrymore.

965
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:31,807
But what about the college?
Who's watching that?

966
01:19:31,892 --> 01:19:32,892
I don't know.

967
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:35,311
- Send somebody over there, okay?
- All right.

968
01:19:39,566 --> 01:19:41,942
Take another man
and get down there now, all right?

969
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:44,278
I don't give a damn.
Just find the son of a bitch.

970
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:45,321
Get some batteries.

971
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:48,115
This guy's not gonna glow in the dark.
Get them down here.

972
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,910
I don't know what's going on.
Reroute it back to me.

973
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:54,205
We need more light.
We'll never find him this way.

974
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:00,878
What time is it?

975
01:20:01,213 --> 01:20:03,506
It's way too early for that.

976
01:20:10,222 --> 01:20:11,388
Cue the sun.

977
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:19,355
What time is it?

978
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:22,066
Christof, what's going on?

979
01:20:22,609 --> 01:20:25,569
Did you know there's a rumor
circulating that he's dead?

980
01:20:25,654 --> 01:20:26,821
You hear me?

981
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:29,198
The media is having a feeding frenzy
over this.

982
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:31,033
All the phone lines are jammed,

983
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:32,701
and every network has a pirated shot

984
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,037
of Marlon making an ass of himself
in front of the camera.

985
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:37,331
The sponsors are threatening
to rip up their contracts.

986
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:38,833
Why? We're getting higher ratings
with this graphic

987
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:42,002
than we've ever had on this show.

988
01:20:44,923 --> 01:20:46,215
No sign of him.

989
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:49,176
Marlon, why don't you head back to town
and join the others?

990
01:20:49,261 --> 01:20:52,221
Everyone else is at first positions, okay?
Thank you.

991
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:55,975
Everyone's at first positions, right?

992
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:14,869
We've got the light.
So he's got to be there somewhere.

993
01:21:17,664 --> 01:21:19,373
We're not watching the sea.

994
01:21:19,457 --> 01:21:22,001
Hang on a minute.
Why would we watch the sea?

995
01:21:22,627 --> 01:21:23,961
Sweep the harbor.

996
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,671
Bring up the harbor cameras.

997
01:21:25,755 --> 01:21:28,090
Shift all harbor cameras to computer,
please.

998
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:29,800
Some of those are out, aren't they?

999
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:33,304
Yeah. We have four of them down,
but we have the lighthouse cameras up.

1000
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:35,848
- All buoy cams, please.
- What's happening?

1001
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:38,601
Long-lens, shore-based cameras.

1002
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:40,728
- Why are we looking at the water?
- Good.

1003
01:21:40,812 --> 01:21:42,646
Pan and zoom please.

1004
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:47,318
Truman,

1005
01:21:49,487 --> 01:21:50,988
where are you going?

1006
01:21:52,949 --> 01:21:54,825
How can he sail? He's in insurance.

1007
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:57,411
- Isn't he terrified of the water?
- Resume transmission.

1008
01:21:57,495 --> 01:21:59,079
Resuming transmission.

1009
01:22:04,294 --> 01:22:07,421
- I got 2-to-1 he doesn't make it.
- I want a piece of that.

1010
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:09,590
2-to-1 he doesn't make it.

1011
01:22:11,968 --> 01:22:13,677
Just leave them in the car.

1012
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:30,611
Let's get off this mast shot. We can't
see his face. Go to the cabin cam.

1013
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:35,157
There. Perfect.

1014
01:22:36,117 --> 01:22:37,660
That's our hero shot.

1015
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:05,062
Let's get another boat out there.

1016
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:08,399
Okay. Listen, Gus, I need you to talk
to the guys on the ferry.

1017
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:11,026
Come on. Get it moving.
Get it out of here.

1018
01:23:13,279 --> 01:23:14,530
Come on.

1019
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:18,742
- I'm usually the bus driver.
- Bottom line is they can't drive the boat.

1020
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,244
They're actors.

1021
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:26,166
How do we stop him?

1022
01:23:36,594 --> 01:23:37,803
Okay.

1023
01:23:40,306 --> 01:23:43,934
We're going to be accessing
the weather program now.

1024
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:48,272
So hold onto your hats. You got that?

1025
01:23:48,773 --> 01:23:52,943
No. I think we're gonna want to localize
the storm over the boat.

1026
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,032
You can get the coordinates for that.

1027
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,743
There's no rescue boat.
He won't know what to do.

1028
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:03,120
He'll turn back. He'll be too afraid.

1029
01:24:06,541 --> 01:24:07,916
Thar she blows.

1030
01:24:19,763 --> 01:24:20,929
Come on.

1031
01:24:44,662 --> 01:24:46,163
Give me some lightning.

1032
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,415
Again.

1033
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,209
Hit him again!

1034
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,181
For God's sake,
the whole world is watching.

1035
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,433
We can't let him die
in front of a live audience.

1036
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:08,352
He was born in front of a live audience.

1037
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,799
Come on, Truman!

1038
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:44,721
You can do it! Hold on!

1039
01:26:09,998 --> 01:26:12,082
Is that the best you can do?

1040
01:26:13,626 --> 01:26:16,753
You're gonna have to kill me!

1041
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:20,174
What shall we do with a drunken sailor?

1042
01:26:20,258 --> 01:26:22,843
- I demand that you cease transmission.
- Keep running.

1043
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:27,264
What shall we do with a drunken sailor
Early in the mornin'?

1044
01:26:27,473 --> 01:26:30,017
Increase the wind.

1045
01:26:32,437 --> 01:26:34,897
- I'm telling you for the last time.
- How close is he?

1046
01:26:34,981 --> 01:26:36,398
- Very close.
- Capsize him. Tip him over.

1047
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:39,359
- Damn you, Christof!
- You can't. He's tied himself to the boat!

1048
01:26:39,444 --> 01:26:40,444
Shut up!

1049
01:26:40,528 --> 01:26:42,321
He's gonna drown,
and he doesn't even care.

1050
01:26:42,405 --> 01:26:43,530
- Do it.
- No.

1051
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:44,615
Do it!

1052
01:27:39,295 --> 01:27:40,545
That's enough.

1053
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:53,131
I want to talk to him.

1054
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:13,318
Truman.

1055
01:32:15,112 --> 01:32:16,404
You can speak.

1056
01:32:18,491 --> 01:32:19,783
I can hear you.

1057
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:25,455
Who are you?

1058
01:32:25,581 --> 01:32:28,124
I am the creator of a television show

1059
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:31,211
that gives hope and joy and inspiration
to millions.

1060
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:37,384
Then who am I?

1061
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:39,177
You're the star.

1062
01:32:45,268 --> 01:32:46,643
Was nothing real?

1063
01:32:47,270 --> 01:32:48,520
You were real.

1064
01:32:49,981 --> 01:32:52,274
That's what made you so good to watch.

1065
01:32:52,984 --> 01:32:54,526
Listen to me, Truman.

1066
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,820
There's no more truth out there

1067
01:32:57,905 --> 01:33:00,532
than there is in the world
I created for you.

1068
01:33:02,493 --> 01:33:04,035
The same lies,

1069
01:33:05,746 --> 01:33:07,080
the same deceit.

1070
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,457
But in my world

1071
01:33:11,294 --> 01:33:13,003
you have nothing to fear.

1072
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:18,925
I know you better than
you know yourself.

1073
01:33:19,010 --> 01:33:21,136
You never had a camera in my head.

1074
01:33:22,930 --> 01:33:24,180
You're afraid.

1075
01:33:25,474 --> 01:33:27,267
That's why you can't leave.

1076
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:33,356
It's okay, Truman.

1077
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:35,734
I understand.

1078
01:33:37,528 --> 01:33:40,030
I have been watching you
your whole life.

1079
01:33:42,825 --> 01:33:44,951
I was watching when you were born.

1080
01:33:47,371 --> 01:33:49,914
I was watching
when you took your first step.

1081
01:33:54,211 --> 01:33:56,713
I watched you on your first day
of school.

1082
01:33:59,592 --> 01:34:02,135
The episode when you lost
your first tooth.

1083
01:34:06,599 --> 01:34:08,308
You can't leave, Truman.

1084
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:11,353
Please, God.

1085
01:34:11,437 --> 01:34:12,896
You belong here...

1086
01:34:13,105 --> 01:34:14,314
You can do it.

1087
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:17,442
...with me.

1088
01:34:19,945 --> 01:34:21,237
Talk to me.

1089
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:23,865
Say something.

1090
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:31,414
Say something, God damn it.
You're on television.

1091
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:33,792
You're live to the whole world.

1092
01:34:51,435 --> 01:34:53,269
In case I don't see you,

1093
01:34:54,438 --> 01:34:56,981
good afternoon, good evening,
and good night.

1094
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:01,236
Yeah.

1095
01:35:24,343 --> 01:35:25,760
Yeah!

1096
01:35:35,479 --> 01:35:38,523
- He made it! Yeah!
- All right, Truman!

1097
01:35:48,367 --> 01:35:50,869
- Cease transmission.
- Ceasing transmission.

1098
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,876
- You want another slice?
- No. I'm okay.

1099
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:00,712
What else is on?
Where's the TV Guide?

00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:43,245
<i>you keep leaving your channel open...</i>

22
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,215
<i>which leads to Martinez responding...</i>

23
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:46,583
<i>which leads to all of us listening...</i>

24
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,217
<i>which leads to me being annoyed.</i>

25
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:49,619
<i>Roger that.</i>

26
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,853
<i>Martinez, the captain
would like you to please...</i>

27
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:52,055
shut your smart mouth.

28
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,392
We'd prefer to use a different adjective

29
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:57,428
to describe Martinez's mouth.

30
00:02:57,429 --> 00:02:58,894
<i>Did Beck just insult me?</i>

31
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:01,263
<i>"Dr. Beck." And yes.</i>

32
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,667
Happy to turn the radios
off from here, Commander.

33
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:04,834
Just say the word.

34
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,269
Wait, Johanssen.

35
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,571
Constant communication is the hallmark...

36
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:08,839
Shut 'em off.

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,939
<i>No.</i>

38
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,675
No. Excuse me.

39
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,377
<i>I apologize for
my countrymen, Vogel.</i>

40
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:15,912
Accepted.

41
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:17,847
How many samples do we need, Commander?

42
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:19,448
<i>Seven.</i>

43
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,951
<i>100 grams each.</i>

44
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,059
We have a mission update. A storm warning.

45
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,626
<i>Commander, you should come inside.</i>

46
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,862
<i>You're gonna want to see this.</i>

47
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:33,096
What is it?

48
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:34,364
<i>A storm warning.</i>

49
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:35,865
I saw that in
this morning's briefing.

50
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:37,935
We'll be inside before it hits.

51
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:40,904
Yeah, they upgraded their estimate.

52
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:42,773
The storm's gonna be a lot worse.

53
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:51,282
<i>Martinez, how does it look?</i>

54
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,651
<i>Not good.</i>

55
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:59,221
"1,200 kilometers in diameter,
bearing 24.41 degrees."

56
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:00,423
That's tracking right towards us.

57
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:02,125
"Based on current escalation,

58
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:05,193
"estimated force of 8,600 newtons."

59
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:06,596
What's the abort force?

60
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:08,799
7,500.

61
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,634
<i>Anything more than
that and the MAV could tip.</i>

62
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:13,036
Do we scrub?

63
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:15,072
Begin abort procedure.

64
00:04:15,073 --> 00:04:17,240
We are estimating
with a margin of error.

65
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:19,207
We could wait it out.

66
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,111
Let's wait it out.

67
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:23,981
Let's wait it out.

68
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,250
Commander?

69
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,752
Prep emergency departure.

70
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,254
Commander?

71
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:32,390
We're scrubbed. That's an order.

72
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:45,168
<i>Martinez, how long before take-off?</i>

73
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:46,670
12 minutes.

74
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:51,341
Visibility is almost zero.

75
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:52,541
Anyone gets lost,

76
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,844
hone in on my suit's telemetry.

77
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:54,844
You ready?

78
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:56,747
Ready.

79
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,050
Commander, are you okay?

80
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:01,918
I'm okay.

81
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,276
Commander, we're at 10 degrees,

82
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:29,579
and the MAV is gonna tip at 12.3.

83
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,048
Hey! We might be able
to keep the MAV from tipping.

84
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,784
How?

85
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,185
Use the cables from the
comms mast as guy-lines...

86
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,122
anchor it with the Rover's.

87
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:40,557
Watch out!

88
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,928
Watney!

89
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:48,664
<i>Warning.
Suit breach detected.</i>

90
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:49,632
What happened?

91
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:50,800
He was hit.

92
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,235
Watney, report.

93
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,870
Before we lost telemetry,

94
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,072
his decompression alarm went off.

95
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,072
Where did you last see him?

96
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:57,372
I don't know where he is.

97
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:58,173
What are the vitals on his suit?

98
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,474
He's offline.

99
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:00,976
A complete loss of signal on Watney.

100
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:02,312
- Beck!
- Yeah.

101
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:04,747
How long can he survive decompression?

102
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:06,315
Less than a minute.

103
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:08,817
Line up, walk west.

104
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:11,121
He may be prone. We
don't wanna step over him.

105
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:13,923
Commander...

106
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:15,824
We're at 10.5 degrees.

107
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:17,060
<i>Warning. Excessive tilt.</i>

108
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:19,896
Tilting to 11 with all the gusts of wind.

109
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:21,497
Copy that.

110
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:24,200
Everyone, hone in on Martinez's suit.

111
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:26,336
It'll get you to airlock.
Get in, prep for launch.

112
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:27,937
What about you, Commander?

113
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,673
I'm gonna search a
little longer. Get moving!

114
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:32,209
Go!

115
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:37,113
Watney!

116
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:39,182
Watney, report!

117
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:41,750
<i>The MAV's at 11.6 degrees.</i>

118
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,185
One good gust and we're tipping.

119
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:44,687
If it tips, you launch.

120
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:46,356
You really think I'm
gonna leave you behind?

121
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:48,423
<i>That's an order, Martinez.</i>

122
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:50,459
Mark!

123
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,063
Mark! Can you hear me?

124
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:58,233
Martinez, what about the proximity radar?

125
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:00,103
Could that detect Watney's suit?

126
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:01,570
It's made to see
the <i>Hermes</i> from orbit...

127
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,406
not a little piece of
metal from a single suit.

128
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,574
<i>Give it a try.</i>

129
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:05,875
Roger.

130
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,077
What is she thinking? She knows

131
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,310
the infrared can't get through a sandstorm.

132
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,613
She's grasping for anything.

133
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:11,481
<i>We've got negative contact</i>

134
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:12,748
<i>on the proximity radar.</i>

135
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:14,050
Nothing?

136
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:16,286
<i>No. I can barely see the Hab.</i>

137
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:19,188
Commander, I know you don't
wanna hear this, but...

138
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,890
Mark is dead.

139
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:23,593
<i>Commander!</i>

140
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:26,062
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you, man?

141
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:27,296
My friend just died.

142
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,664
I don't want my commander to die, too.

143
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,933
<i>Stability warning.</i>

144
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,500
We're tipping!

145
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:34,437
<i>Commander, you need to
get back to the ship, now!</i>

146
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:36,006
13 degrees.

147
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:38,341
If we pass balance, we'll never rock back.

148
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:39,575
I've got one more trick left,

149
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:41,416
and then I'm following orders, Commander.

150
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,913
You're firing the OMS?

151
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:46,317
That's right.

152
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,721
Commander!

153
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,402
On my way.

154
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,627
<i>Johanssen, let's go.</i>

155
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:07,470
Mark!

156
00:08:19,383 --> 00:08:21,151
<i>We're at 11.5 and holding.</i>

157
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:25,956
<i>Ready to go on your command.</i>

158
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:29,393
Ready to launch.

159
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,961
Commander.

160
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:33,696
I need you to verbally
tell me whether or not to.

161
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:35,199
Launch.

162
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:18,106
<i>At around 4:30 a.m.</i>

163
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:19,674
<i>Central Standard Time...</i>

164
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:21,977
<i>our satellites detected a storm</i>

165
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,014
<i>approaching the</i> Ares
3<i> mission site on Mars.</i>

166
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:28,784
<i>At 6:45, the storm had
escalated to severe...</i>

167
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,855
<i>and we had no choice but
to abort the mission.</i>

168
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:34,256
<i>Thanks to the quick action
of Commander Lewis...</i>

169
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:37,726
<i>astronauts Beck, Johanssen,
Martinez and Vogel...</i>

170
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:40,630
<i>were all able to reach
the Mars Ascent Vehicle...</i>

171
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:44,168
<i>and perform an emergency
launch at 7:28 Central Time.</i>

172
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,870
Unfortunately, during the evacuation...

173
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:51,740
astronaut Mark Watney was
struck by debris and killed.

174
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,044
Commander Lewis and the rest of her team...

175
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:57,480
were able to intercept
safely with the <i>Hermes</i>

176
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:59,615
and are now heading home.

177
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:02,485
But Mark Watney is dead.

178
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:03,486
Director Sanders!

179
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,656
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

180
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:49,365
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

181
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,474
<i>Oxygen level...</i>

182
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:18,221
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

183
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:19,369
Fuck.

184
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,664
Okay.

185
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:51,400
<i>Okay.</i>

186
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:57,440
<i>Hello, this is Mark Watney, astronaut.</i>

187
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,009
<i>I'm entering this log for the record...</i>

188
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,813
<i>in case I don't make it.</i>

189
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:10,318
<i>It is 06:53 on Sol 19...</i>

190
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:13,589
<i>and I'm alive.</i>

191
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,024
<i>Obviously.</i>

192
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:18,561
<i>But I'm guessing that's
gonna come as a surprise</i>

193
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:22,030
<i>to my crewmates and to NASA.</i>

194
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,967
<i>And to the entire world, really, so...</i>

195
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,572
<i>Surprise.</i>

196
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:32,909
<i>I did not die on Sol 18.</i>

197
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,043
<i>Best I can figure...</i>

198
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:37,279
<i>this length of our primary
communications antenna</i>

199
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,746
<i>broke off...</i>

200
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,982
<i>and tore through my bio-monitor...</i>

201
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:43,719
<i>and ripped a hole in me as well.</i>

202
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:47,356
<i>But the antenna and the blood, really,</i>

203
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:49,558
<i>managed to seal the
breach in my suit...</i>

204
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,260
<i>which kept me alive,</i>

205
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,863
<i>even though the crew must
have thought I was dead.</i>

206
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,133
<i>I have no way to contact NASA.</i>

207
00:16:57,134 --> 00:17:00,101
<i>And even if I could, it's
gonna be four years...</i>

208
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,738
<i>until a manned mission can reach me.</i>

209
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:05,975
<i>And I'm in a Hab
designed to last 31 days.</i>

210
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:08,377
<i>If the oxygenator breaks,
I'm gonna suffocate.</i>

211
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:11,013
<i>If the water reclaimer
breaks, I'll die of thirst.</i>

212
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:13,215
<i>If the Hab breaches, I'm
just gonna, kind of...</i>

213
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:14,750
<i>implode.</i>

214
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:18,687
<i>And if by some miracle,
none of that happens...</i>

215
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:21,591
<i>eventually I'm gonna run out of food.</i>

216
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,193
<i>So...</i>

217
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,629
<i>yeah.</i>

218
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,835
<i>Yeah.</i>

219
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:23,145
I'm not gonna die here.

220
00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:04,321
32...

221
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,856
33...

222
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,160
34...

223
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,828
35, 36.

224
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:15,697
Sweet and sour chicken.

225
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:49,798
What do we got?

226
00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:58,640
<i>Right, let's do the math.</i>

227
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:02,378
<i>Our surface mission here was
supposed to last 31 sols.</i>

228
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:04,012
<i>For redundancy, they sent
68 sols worth of food.</i>

229
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,547
<i>That's for 6 people.</i>

230
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:08,417
<i>So for just me, that's
gonna last 300 sols...</i>

231
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:11,553
<i>which I figure I can
stretch to 400 if I ration.</i>

232
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:14,724
<i>So I got to figure out a way to grow</i>

233
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:16,860
<i>three years' worth of food here.</i>

234
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,129
<i>On a planet where nothing grows.</i>

235
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,731
<i>Luckily...</i>

236
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,402
<i>I'm a botanist.</i>

237
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:34,277
<i>Mars will come to
fear my botany powers.</i>

238
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:21,023
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

239
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,068
<i>Staple came out.</i>

240
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:24,487
Fuck you, Mars.

241
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:41,270
Johanssen, Jesus.

242
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:33,456
<i>  Sunday, Monday, Happy Days</i>

243
00:24:33,457 --> 00:24:35,991
<i>  Tuesday, Wednesday, Happy Days</i>

244
00:24:35,992 --> 00:24:38,494
<i>  Thursday, Friday, Happy Days</i>

245
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:40,896
<i>  The weekend comes, my cycle hums</i>

246
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,064
<i>  Ready to race to you  </i>

247
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,801
<i>The problem is water.</i>

248
00:24:45,802 --> 00:24:51,172
I have created 126 square meters of soil.

249
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:53,307
<i>But every cubic meter of soil requires</i>

250
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:56,410
<i>40 liters of water to be farmable.</i>

251
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,883
<i>So I gotta make a lot more water.</i>

252
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:03,084
<i>Good thing is, I know the recipe.</i>

253
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,453
You take hydrogen, you
add oxygen, you burn.

254
00:25:05,454 --> 00:25:08,389
<i>Now, I have hundreds of liters</i>

255
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,494
<i>of unused hydrazine at the MDV.</i>

256
00:25:11,495 --> 00:25:14,195
<i>If I run the hydrazine
over an iridium catalyst,</i>

257
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:17,064
<i>it'll separate into N2 and H2.</i>

258
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:21,235
<i>And then if I just direct the
hydrogen into a small area...</i>

259
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:23,604
<i>and burn it.</i>

260
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,675
<i>Luckily, in the history of humanity...</i>

261
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:28,543
nothing bad has ever happened

262
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:31,947
from lighting hydrogen on fire.

263
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,915
<i>NASA hates fire.</i>

264
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,184
<i>Because of the whole</i>

265
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:38,453
<i>"fire makes everybody
die in space" thing.</i>

266
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,255
<i>So, everything they
sent us up here with</i>

267
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:41,889
<i>is flame-retardant...</i>

268
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,360
with the notable exception of...

269
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,463
Martinez's personal items.

270
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:50,632
I am sorry, Martinez.

271
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,100
But if you didn't want me
to go through your stuff...

272
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:55,537
you shouldn't have left me
for dead on a desolate planet.

273
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:56,905
By the way, I'm figuring you're gonna be

274
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:59,475
fine with this, given my present situation.

275
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,475
<i>What's everybody doing?</i>

276
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,409
<i>Taking a holiday from being cool?</i>

277
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,479
Counting on you.

278
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,034
Whoo!

279
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,282
So, yeah, I blew myself up.

280
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:42,851
Best guess...

281
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:48,391
I forgot to account
for the excess oxygen...

282
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,227
that I've been exhaling
when I did my calculations.

283
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:55,999
Because I'm stupid.

284
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:00,435
Yeah, I'm gonna get back to work here...

285
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:03,573
just as soon as my ears stop ringing.

286
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:09,276
<i>Interesting side note,</i>

287
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:12,246
<i>this is actually how the Jet
Propulsion Lab was founded.</i>

288
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:15,851
<i>Five guys at Caltech were
trying to make rocket fuel...</i>

289
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:17,285
<i>and they nearly burned down their dorm.</i>

290
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:18,853
<i>And rather than expel them...</i>

291
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:21,723
<i>they banished them to a nearby farm,</i>

292
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,625
<i>told them to keep working.</i>

293
00:27:24,261 --> 00:27:25,960
<i>And now we have a space program.</i>

294
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:31,166
Okay.

295
00:28:47,944 --> 00:28:50,146
Hey, there.

296
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,223
<i>The nation was blessed</i>

297
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:03,492
<i>to have Mark serving
in our space program.</i>

298
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,994
<i>While his loss will be deeply felt...</i>

299
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:08,730
<i>the men and women of NASA
will soldier forth...</i>

300
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:11,299
<i>onward and upward in the
mission of their agency.</i>

301
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,334
<i>By doing so, they honor the legacy</i>

302
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,738
<i>Mark's leaving behind...</i>

303
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:19,741
<i>and they ensure his sacrifice
will not be in vain.</i>

304
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,321
<i>I have the honor of speaking</i>

305
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:34,589
<i>not only for the men
and women of NASA...</i>

306
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,358
<i>but for people all over the world...</i>

307
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,759
I thought you gave
a lovely speech, by the way.

308
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,130
I need you to authorize my satellite time.

309
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:44,934
It's not gonna happen.

310
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:46,936
We're funded for five <i>Ares</i> missions.

311
00:29:46,937 --> 00:29:49,505
I think I can get Congress
to authorize a sixth.

312
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:51,806
- No.
- <i>Ares 3</i> evac'd after 18 sols.

313
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,841
There's half a mission
worth of supplies up there.

314
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:54,909
I can sell it at a fraction

315
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,710
of the cost of a normal mission...

316
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,147
and all I have to know is
what's left of our assets.

317
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:00,849
You're not the only one
who needs satellite time.

318
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,851
We've got the <i>Ares 4</i>
supply missions coming up.

319
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:05,020
We should be focusing on
the Schiaparelli Crater.

320
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:06,053
Okay, we got 12 satellites up there.

321
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,456
Surely we can spare a few hours...

322
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:09,556
It's not about the satellite time, Vince.

323
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,992
We're a public domain organization.

324
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:12,026
We need to be transparent on this.

325
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:13,360
Okay.

326
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,130
The second we point the
satellites at the Hab...

327
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:16,230
I broadcast pictures

328
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,998
of Mark Watney's dead body to the world.

329
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,833
You're afraid of a PR problem?

330
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,402
Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem.

331
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,005
Another mission?

332
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:25,608
Congress won't reimburse
us for a paper clip...

333
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:27,207
if I put a dead astronaut on the front page

334
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,843
of <i>The Washington Post.</i>

335
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:31,745
He's not going anywhere,
Teddy. I mean, he's not...

336
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,715
He's not gonna decompose, you know.

337
00:30:33,716 --> 00:30:35,216
He's gonna be up there forever.

338
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:38,085
Meteorology estimates that
he'll be covered in sand...

339
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,022
from normal weather activity within a year.

340
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:41,957
We can't wait a year. We got work to do.

341
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,524
<i>Ares 5</i> won't even
launch for five years.

342
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,293
We have plenty of time.

343
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:46,761
Okay.

344
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,298
Okay.

345
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,268
Okay, consider this.

346
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:56,370
Right now, the world's on our side.

347
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:58,139
Sympathy for the Watney family.

348
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,508
<i>Ares 6</i> could bring his body home.

349
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:03,411
Now, we don't say that's
the purpose of the mission...

350
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:05,412
but we make it clear that
that would be a part of it.

351
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:07,215
We frame it that way.

352
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:10,819
More support from Congress.
But not if we wait a year.

353
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,321
We wait a year, nobody gives a shit.

354
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:47,956
Vincent Kapoor?

355
00:31:53,028 --> 00:31:55,530
6-2.

356
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:57,733
7-6-2.

357
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:03,772
Acidalia Planitia.

358
00:32:14,316 --> 00:32:15,817
What?

359
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:31,999
Hi. Security?

360
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,968
This is Mindy Park in SatCon.

361
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:36,772
I need the emergency
contact for Vincent Kapoor.

362
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:38,806
Yes, him.

363
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,909
Yes, it's an emergency!

364
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:47,248
How sure?

365
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:48,983
100%.

366
00:32:48,984 --> 00:32:50,952
You've got to be shitting me.

367
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:53,856
Prove it to me.

368
00:32:55,124 --> 00:32:56,858
For a start...

369
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,294
the solar panels have been cleaned.

370
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:01,862
They could have been cleaned by wind.

371
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:04,399
Back it up. Look at <i>Rover 2.</i>

372
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,632
According to the logs,

373
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:06,735
Commander Lewis took it out on Sol 17...

374
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:09,204
plugged it into the Hab to recharge.

375
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:10,938
It's been moved.

376
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:12,640
She could have forgotten to log the move.

377
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:14,175
No, not likely.

378
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:15,510
Why don't we just ask Lewis?

379
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:17,312
Let's get on CAPCOM and
ask her directly right now.

380
00:33:17,313 --> 00:33:18,380
No. No.

381
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:19,714
If Watney is really alive,

382
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:21,783
we don't want the <i>Ares 3</i> crew to know.

383
00:33:21,784 --> 00:33:23,418
How can you not tell them?

384
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,553
They have another 10
months on their trip home.

385
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:26,888
Space travel is dangerous.

386
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:28,623
They need to be alert and undistracted.

387
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:30,024
But they already think he's dead.

388
00:33:30,025 --> 00:33:31,059
And they'd be devastated to find out

389
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,227
they left him there alive.

390
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:35,630
I'm sorry, but you
have not thought this through.

391
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:38,800
What are we gonna say? "Dear America...

392
00:33:38,801 --> 00:33:40,535
"remember that astronaut we killed

393
00:33:40,536 --> 00:33:42,169
"and had a really nice funeral for?

394
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,773
"Turns out he's alive and
we left him on Mars. Our bad.

395
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:46,573
"Sincerely, NASA."

396
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:49,142
Do you realize the shitstorm
that is about to hit us?

397
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:50,913
How are we going to handle the public?

398
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:54,716
Legally, we have 24 hours
to release these pictures.

399
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:56,118
We release a statement with them.

400
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,239
We don't want people
working it out on their own.

401
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,255
Yes, sir.

402
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:01,989
But if my math is right,
he's going to starve to death

403
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,825
long before we can help him.

404
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,030
Can you imagine what he's
going through up there?

405
00:34:09,031 --> 00:34:10,865
He's 50 million miles away from home.

406
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:12,233
He thinks he's totally alone.

407
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:14,102
He thinks we gave up on him.

408
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:17,705
What does that do to
a man, psychologically?

409
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,109
What the hell is he thinking right now?

410
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:28,082
<i>I'm definitely gonna die up here...</i>

411
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:32,186
<i>if I have to listen to any
more god-awful disco music.</i>

412
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:34,021
My God, Commander Lewis,

413
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:35,957
couldn't you have packed
anything from this century?

414
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:38,760
<i>  Turn the beat around  </i>

415
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:40,829
No, I am not gonna "turn the beat around."

416
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,665
I refuse to.

417
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:45,432
Mr. Sanders? Mr. Sanders?

418
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:47,968
What attempts have been made

419
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,803
to make contact with Mark Watney?

420
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:52,073
We're working on it.

421
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:53,673
Does he have enough supplies to survive?

422
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,443
We'll be looking into that.

423
00:34:55,444 --> 00:34:56,778
What does this say about the agency?

424
00:34:56,779 --> 00:34:57,845
Are you gonna resign?

425
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,081
No.

426
00:34:59,082 --> 00:35:00,850
Director Sanders!

427
00:35:05,154 --> 00:35:07,956
<i>It's time to
start thinking long term.</i>

428
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:10,390
<i>The next NASA mission is</i> Ares 4...

429
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:12,959
<i>and it's supposed to land
at Schiaparelli Crater...</i>

430
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,497
<i>3200 kilometers away.</i>

431
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:20,068
3,200 kilometers.

432
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:22,436
<i>In four years, when the
next</i> Ares <i>crew arrives,</i>

433
00:35:22,437 --> 00:35:24,072
<i>I'll have to be there.</i>

434
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:27,008
<i>Which means I have
to get to the crater.</i>

435
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:31,111
<i>Okay, so here's the rub.</i>

436
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:33,015
<i>I've got one working Rover</i>

437
00:35:33,016 --> 00:35:36,684
<i>designed to go a max
distance of 35 kilometers...</i>

438
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:40,120
<i>before the battery has to
be recharged at the Hab.</i>

439
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,256
<i>That's Problem A.</i>

440
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:45,626
<i>Problem B is this
journey's gonna take me</i>

441
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:49,062
<i>roughly 50 days to complete.</i>

442
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,566
<i>So I gotta live for 50 days...</i>

443
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,700
<i>inside a Rover with
marginal life support</i>

444
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,236
<i>the size of a small van.</i>

445
00:35:57,973 --> 00:35:59,606
<i>So, in the face of overwhelming odds,</i>

446
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:02,343
<i>I'm left with only one option.</i>

447
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:05,781
<i>I'm gonna have to science
the shit out of this.</i>

448
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,077
Okay, so, success.

449
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,645
Uh...

450
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:43,986
I have doubled my battery life
by scavenging <i>Rover 1.</i>

451
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:47,990
But if I use the heater...

452
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:53,796
I will burn through half
my battery every day.

453
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:59,067
If I do not use my heater, I will be...

454
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:03,470
slowly killed by
the laws of thermodynamics.

455
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,974
I would love to solve
this problem right now

456
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:08,809
but unfortunately...

457
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,614
<i>my balls are frozen.</i>

458
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:15,283
I can't. I'm calling it. I'm calling it.

459
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,564
<i>Good news, I may have a solution</i>

460
00:37:29,565 --> 00:37:31,298
<i>to my heating problem.</i>

461
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:33,635
<i>Bad news, it involves me digging up</i>

462
00:37:33,636 --> 00:37:36,437
<i>the Radioisotope
Thermoelectric Generator.</i>

463
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:38,640
<i>Now, if I remember my
training correctly,</i>

464
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:40,707
<i>one of the lessons was titled...</i>

465
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:44,077
<i>"Don't Dig Up the Big
Box of Plutonium, Mark."</i>

466
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:46,113
<i>I get it. RTGs are good for spacecraft,</i>

467
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:47,948
<i>but if they rupture around humans...</i>

468
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:49,383
<i>no more humans.</i>

469
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:51,252
<i>Which is why we buried
it when we arrived.</i>

470
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,220
<i>And planted that flag...</i>

471
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:54,588
<i>so we would never be stupid enough</i>

472
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:57,091
<i>to accidentally go near it again.</i>

473
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,961
<i>But as long as I don't break it...</i>

474
00:37:59,962 --> 00:38:01,296
<i>I almost just said</i>

475
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:03,363
<i>"Everything will be fine" out loud.</i>

476
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,332
Look, the point is, I'm not cold anymore.

477
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,966
And sure, I could choose to think

478
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,369
about the fact that I'm warm...

479
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,405
because I have a decaying

480
00:38:10,406 --> 00:38:12,439
radioactive isotope
riding right behind me...

481
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,209
but right now, I got
bigger problems on my hands.

482
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,611
<i>I have scoured every single data file</i>

483
00:38:17,612 --> 00:38:19,847
<i>on Commander Lewis' personal drive.</i>

484
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:24,318
<i>This is officially the
least disco song she owns.</i>

485
00:38:25,187 --> 00:38:27,055
<i>  Lookin' for some hot stuff</i>

486
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:29,122
<i>  Baby, this evenin'</i>

487
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:32,227
<i>  I need some hot stuff, baby, tonight</i>

488
00:38:33,395 --> 00:38:37,898
<i>  I want some hot
stuff, baby, this evenin'</i>

489
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:42,169
<i>  Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight</i>

490
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,173
<i>  Hot stuff</i>

491
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:48,210
<i>  I need hot stuff</i>

492
00:38:49,111 --> 00:38:52,113
<i>  I want some hot stuff</i>

493
00:38:53,082 --> 00:38:56,151
<i>  I need hot stuff  </i>

494
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:00,687
- Yeah.
- Where is Watney going?

495
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:03,157
We believe that he's
preparing for a journey.

496
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:05,358
He's been conducting incremental tests...

497
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,861
taking the <i>Rover 2</i> out for longer

498
00:39:06,862 --> 00:39:08,729
and longer trips each time.

499
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,066
To what end? Why would he leave

500
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,601
the relative safety of the Hab?

501
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,102
Well, we think that he plans to travel

502
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,604
to the <i>Ares 4</i> launch site...

503
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,106
in order to make contact with us,

504
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:19,907
but it would be a dangerous gamble.

505
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,276
<i>But if we could talk to him,</i>

506
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:22,776
<i>we would tell him to stay put...</i>

507
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,211
<i>and to trust that we are
doing everything in our power</i>

508
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:27,314
<i>to bring him home alive.</i>

509
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:29,417
Thank you very much.

510
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:34,055
Don't say "Bring him home alive," Vincent.

511
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:36,289
You know what? These
interviews aren't easy.

512
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,892
So God forbid I try to say something

513
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:39,561
proactive and positive.

514
00:39:39,562 --> 00:39:40,729
Annie.

515
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,463
No more Vincent on TV. Copy that.

516
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,834
76 kilometers. Am I reading that right?

517
00:39:46,835 --> 00:39:48,169
Are you asking me?

518
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,204
I am.

519
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:50,738
Yes, sir.

520
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:53,840
Mark drove two hours
straightaway from the Hab...

521
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:56,044
did a short EVA and then
drove for another two.

522
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:58,745
We think the EVA was to change batteries.

523
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:00,081
He didn't load up the oxygenator

524
00:40:00,082 --> 00:40:01,682
or the water reclaimer?

525
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:04,517
Every 41 hours, there's a 17 minute gap.

526
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:06,619
It's just the way the orbits work...

527
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,657
so it's possible that we missed something.

528
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,392
I want that gap down to four minutes.

529
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:13,427
I'm giving you total authority

530
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:15,597
over satellite trajectories
and orbital adjustments.

531
00:40:15,598 --> 00:40:16,831
Make it happen.

532
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,332
Okay.

533
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,269
Let's assume Miss Park
didn't miss anything.

534
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,637
So Mark's not going to <i>Ares 4.</i> Yet.

535
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:26,006
But he's smart enough to figure out

536
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,443
that's his only chance.

537
00:40:28,444 --> 00:40:31,278
Bruce, what's the earliest
we can get a pre-supply there?

538
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:33,481
<i>With the positions of Earth and Mars,</i>

539
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:35,817
<i>it'll take nine months.</i>

540
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:38,686
<i>It'll take six months to
build it in the first place.</i>

541
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,119
Three months.

542
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,622
Three?

543
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:42,756
<i>You're going
to say it's impossible</i>

544
00:40:42,757 --> 00:40:44,390
<i>and then I'm gonna make a speech...</i>

545
00:40:44,391 --> 00:40:45,392
<i>about the blinding capabilities</i>

546
00:40:45,393 --> 00:40:46,794
<i>of the JPL team...</i>

547
00:40:46,795 --> 00:40:47,961
<i>and then you're going to do the math</i>

548
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:49,296
<i>in your head and say something like...</i>

549
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:51,365
"The overtime alone will be a nightmare."

550
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,233
<i>The overtime alone will be a nightmare.</i>

551
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:54,434
Get started.

552
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:56,238
I'll find you the money.

553
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:59,173
We need to tell the crew.

554
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:00,073
Mitch, we've discussed this.

555
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:01,876
No, you discussed this.

556
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:05,279
I'm the one who decides
what's best for the crew.

557
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:08,016
They deserve to know.

558
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:11,151
Once there's a real rescue
plan, we'll tell them.

559
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:13,021
Otherwise, it's moot.

560
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:15,622
Bruce has three months
to get the payload done.

561
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:17,358
That's all that matters right now.

562
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,160
<i>We'll do our best.</i>

563
00:41:19,161 --> 00:41:21,997
Mark dies if you don't.

564
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:27,133
<i>It's been 48 sols
since I planted the potatoes.</i>

565
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:29,336
<i>So now it's time to reap and re-sow.</i>

566
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:31,972
<i>They grew even better than I expected.</i>

567
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:35,175
<i>I now have 400 healthy potato plants.</i>

568
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:38,345
<i>I dug them up, being careful
to leave their plants alive.</i>

569
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:39,948
<i>The smaller ones I'll reseed,</i>

570
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:42,416
<i>the larger ones are my food supply.</i>

571
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:46,320
<i>All natural, organic,
Martian-grown potatoes.</i>

572
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:49,356
<i>You don't hear that every day, do you?</i>

573
00:41:49,357 --> 00:41:51,157
<i>And by the way, none of
this matters at all...</i>

574
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:54,495
<i>if I can't figure out a way
to make contact with NASA.</i>

575
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,452
<i>I know what I'm gonna do.</i>

576
00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:47,146
Oh! He's moving again.

577
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,751
Where the hell is he going?

578
00:42:49,752 --> 00:42:52,086
He hasn't changed course for 13 days.

579
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:54,555
He's nowhere near the <i>Ares 4.</i>

580
00:42:54,556 --> 00:42:56,523
Unless he's not taking a direct route.

581
00:42:56,524 --> 00:43:00,461
He might be trying to avoid some obstacle.

582
00:43:00,462 --> 00:43:02,262
What obstacle?

583
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:03,765
It's Acidalia Planitia.

584
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:05,734
There's nothing out there except the...

585
00:43:07,937 --> 00:43:09,571
What?

586
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,042
I need a map.

587
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,716
Yeah.

588
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:24,184
Hey, come on. What are you doing?

589
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,218
It's all right. It's all right.

590
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:26,687
Can I borrow this?

591
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,789
Okay, so where is the Hab location?

592
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,459
31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west.

593
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,693
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

594
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,794
- Where's Watney?
- Uh...

595
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:35,963
There.

596
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:37,465
Okay.

597
00:43:43,337 --> 00:43:46,472
Okay. I know where he's going.

598
00:43:46,473 --> 00:43:48,409
I need to get on an airplane.

599
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:21,976
Vincent, how are you?

600
00:44:21,977 --> 00:44:23,311
Good to see you.

601
00:44:23,312 --> 00:44:24,778
- Good flight?
- Uh...

602
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:26,280
Yeah.

603
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:29,584
It's in storage just around the corner.

604
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:04,952
Hey, Vincent, nice to see you again.

605
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:06,287
Nice to see you.

606
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:08,655
What are the chances Mark
can get it working again?

607
00:45:08,656 --> 00:45:12,392
It's hard to say. We lost contact in '97.

608
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:14,628
We think it was battery failure.

609
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,896
Though I'd like to point out

610
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:18,633
it lasted three times longer
than expected in any...

611
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:19,932
Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce.

612
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:21,068
I just need to speak to everybody

613
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:22,202
that was here in '97.

614
00:45:22,203 --> 00:45:24,003
They're already here. Guys.

615
00:45:24,004 --> 00:45:25,606
I'd like to introduce Vincent Kapoor.

616
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:27,441
Director of Mars Missions for NASA.

617
00:45:27,442 --> 00:45:28,743
This is our current team...

618
00:45:29,344 --> 00:45:31,745
and our original project members.

619
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,229
- Is this the replica?
- This is her.

620
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,532
Okay. Let's see it.

621
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:53,468
<i>Pathfinder.</i>

622
00:45:58,473 --> 00:46:00,475
<i>Pathfinder.</i>

623
00:47:10,712 --> 00:47:13,281
Come on. Come on.

624
00:47:33,335 --> 00:47:35,703
Holy shit. Okay.

625
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:37,671
"Broadcasting status.

626
00:47:37,672 --> 00:47:38,939
"Listening for telemetry signal."

627
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,475
Uh-huh.

628
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,211
Okay. Signal acquired.

629
00:47:44,478 --> 00:47:45,479
- All right.
- Okay.

630
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,249
Camera.

631
00:48:36,631 --> 00:48:38,433
Incoming.

632
00:48:40,301 --> 00:48:43,738
"Are you receiving me?"

633
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:46,273
"Yes. No."

634
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,343
Okay, point the camera at "yes."

635
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,046
32-minute round-trip
communications time.

636
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:54,581
All he can do is ask yes or no questions...

637
00:48:54,582 --> 00:48:56,716
and all we can do is point the camera.

638
00:48:56,717 --> 00:48:57,885
This won't exactly be
an Algonquin Round Table

639
00:48:57,886 --> 00:48:59,220
of snappy repartee.

640
00:48:59,221 --> 00:49:01,120
- Are you kidding me?
- Tim, Tim.

641
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:03,356
- Just point the camera.
- Roger that.

642
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,926
Pointing the camera.

643
00:49:16,737 --> 00:49:18,406
Whoo!

644
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:21,675
Yes!

645
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:24,111
Yes!

646
00:49:25,346 --> 00:49:27,715
<i>So here's the rub.</i>

647
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:30,151
<i>Somehow we have to have complex</i>

648
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:31,792
<i>astrophysical engineering
conversations...</i>

649
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:36,823
<i>using nothing but a
still-frame camera...</i>

650
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:38,959
<i>from 1996.</i>

651
00:49:41,663 --> 00:49:43,631
<i>Luckily...</i>

652
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:47,466
<i>the camera does spin.</i>

653
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:49,736
So I can make an alphabet.

654
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,671
It can't be our alphabet.

655
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:54,175
26 characters plus a question card

656
00:49:54,176 --> 00:49:56,644
into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc.

657
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:58,244
That's way too narrow.

658
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,115
I'd never know what the
camera was pointing at.

659
00:50:07,355 --> 00:50:08,990
Ooh.

660
00:50:13,228 --> 00:50:14,796
Hexadecimals.

661
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:20,867
Hexadecimals to the rescue.

662
00:50:20,868 --> 00:50:22,302
<i>I figured one of you guys</i>

663
00:50:22,303 --> 00:50:24,537
<i>kept an ASCII table lying around.</i>

664
00:50:24,538 --> 00:50:25,838
<i>And I was right.</i>

665
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,140
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

666
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:30,711
<i>I give you super-nerd Beth Johanssen.</i>

667
00:50:30,712 --> 00:50:33,747
<i>Who also had copies of</i> Zork II...

668
00:50:33,748 --> 00:50:36,550
<i>and</i> Leather Goddesses of
Phobos <i>on her personal laptop.</i>

669
00:50:37,819 --> 00:50:39,486
<i>Seriously, Johanssen...</i>

670
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,256
it's like the Smithsonian
of loneliness on there.

671
00:50:42,257 --> 00:50:44,358
- <i>Not that I'm complaining.</i>
- Yes!

672
00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:46,761
<i>Who am I to talk about loneliness?</i>

673
00:51:06,614 --> 00:51:09,049
I know where he's going with this.

674
00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:58,898
"F, O."

675
00:51:58,899 --> 00:52:01,101
"7, W."

676
00:52:18,486 --> 00:52:19,653
Vincent.

677
00:52:19,654 --> 00:52:21,722
Vincent, wake up.

678
00:52:33,868 --> 00:52:36,869
<i>Now that we can have more
complicated conversations...</i>

679
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:39,139
<i>the smart people at NASA
have sent me instructions</i>

680
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,874
<i>on how to hack the Rover...</i>

681
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:43,142
<i>so that it can talk to</i> Pathfinder.

682
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:45,311
<i>If I hack a tiny bit of code...</i>

683
00:52:45,312 --> 00:52:48,548
<i>just 20 instructions in the
Rover's operating system...</i>

684
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:50,084
<i>NASA can link the Rover to</i> Pathfinder's

685
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:52,084
<i>broadcasting frequency...</i>

686
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,888
<i>and we're in business.</i>

687
00:53:07,669 --> 00:53:09,135
"Mark...

688
00:53:09,136 --> 00:53:11,972
"this is Vincent Kapoor.

689
00:53:11,973 --> 00:53:15,343

00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:18,912
<i>"The whole world is rooting for you.</i>

691
00:53:19,547 --> 00:53:23,050
<i>"Amazing job getting</i> Pathfinder.

692
00:53:23,051 --> 00:53:25,653
<i>"We're working on rescue plans.</i>

693
00:53:25,654 --> 00:53:28,889
<i>"Meantime, we're putting
together a supply mission...</i>

694
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:33,794
"to keep you fed until <i>Ares 4</i> arrives."

695
00:53:50,277 --> 00:53:51,812
Okay.

696
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:02,756
Okay.

697
00:54:03,424 --> 00:54:05,659
"Glad to hear it. Really
looking forward to not dying."

698
00:54:17,871 --> 00:54:19,673
"How's the crew?"

699
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:22,644
"What did they say when
they found out I was alive?"

700
00:54:43,297 --> 00:54:45,731
Guys, can we get some space please?

701
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:46,800
Me?

702
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:48,135
Yeah, you.

703
00:54:48,136 --> 00:54:49,937
Give me a sec.

704
00:54:55,877 --> 00:54:57,879
Just tell him.

705
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:12,459
"We haven't told the
crew you are alive yet.

706
00:55:14,094 --> 00:55:18,466
"We need them to concentrate
on their mission."

707
00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:33,448
What the fuck?

708
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:35,383
What the fuck?

709
00:55:42,424 --> 00:55:45,157
Okay, he says, "They don't know I'm alive?

710
00:55:45,158 --> 00:55:47,126
"What the..." F-word.

711
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:48,494
F-word in gerund form.

712
00:55:48,495 --> 00:55:50,097
F-word, again, "is wrong with you?"

713
00:55:52,634 --> 00:55:56,236
"Mark, please watch your language.

714
00:55:56,237 --> 00:55:58,405
"Everything you type

715
00:55:58,406 --> 00:56:02,944
"is being broadcast
live all over the world."

716
00:56:04,978 --> 00:56:06,481
Yeah?

717
00:56:14,489 --> 00:56:15,655
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

718
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:19,659
Yes, sir.

719
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,962
He is under a tremendous amount of stress.

720
00:56:23,098 --> 00:56:24,658
I understand. We're working on it.

721
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:26,932
I'm sure he didn't mean what he said.

722
00:56:26,933 --> 00:56:28,869
Thank you, Mr. President.

723
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:31,738
Problem is, Mark's right.

724
00:56:31,739 --> 00:56:34,106
The longer we wait, the
worse it's gonna get.

725
00:56:34,107 --> 00:56:35,675
We need to tell the crew.

726
00:56:35,676 --> 00:56:38,343
You're bringing this up while
Vincent is in Pasadena...

727
00:56:38,344 --> 00:56:40,079
so he can't argue the other side.

728
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,615
I shouldn't have to answer to Vincent.

729
00:56:41,616 --> 00:56:43,551
Or anyone else.

730
00:56:45,286 --> 00:56:47,321
It's time, Teddy.

731
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,579
<i>Commander Lewis?</i>

732
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,048
Go ahead.

733
00:57:14,614 --> 00:57:16,483
<i>Data dump is almost complete.</i>

734
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:19,586
Copy that. On my way.

735
00:57:32,165 --> 00:57:33,666
You're in a hurry.

736
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,169
Yeah.

737
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,204
My son turned three yesterday.

738
00:57:37,205 --> 00:57:39,339
Should be pictures of the party.

739
00:57:49,516 --> 00:57:51,517
Got a batch of personals.

740
00:57:51,518 --> 00:57:54,055
Dispatching them to your laptops now.

741
00:57:54,989 --> 00:57:58,291
I don't need to read Vogel's
weird German fetish emails.

742
00:57:58,292 --> 00:58:00,293
They're telemetry updates.

743
00:58:00,294 --> 00:58:01,894
Hey, whatever does it for you, man.

744
00:58:02,964 --> 00:58:04,430
There's a video message.

745
00:58:04,431 --> 00:58:06,566
It's addressed to the whole crew.

746
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:09,302
Play it. Come on, guys.

747
00:58:09,303 --> 00:58:10,970
I wanna get in on
that telemetry action.

748
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:18,111
<i>Hi, hello. It's Mitch. Mitch Henderson.</i>

749
00:58:18,112 --> 00:58:20,280
<i>I have some news.</i>

750
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:23,550
<i>There's no subtle way to put this.</i>

751
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:25,619
<i>Mark Watney is still alive.</i>

752
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,653
Oh, my God.

753
00:58:27,654 --> 00:58:29,889
<i>I know that's a surprise and I know</i>

754
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:31,423
<i>you will have a lot of questions.</i>

755
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:34,394
<i>But here are the basics.</i>

756
00:58:34,395 --> 00:58:37,231
<i>He's alive and he's healthy.</i>

757
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:42,468
<i>We found out two months ago
and decided not to tell you.</i>

758
00:58:42,469 --> 00:58:43,936
- Two months?
- Oh, my God.

759
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,773
<i>I was strongly
against that decision.</i>

760
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:49,776
<i>We're telling you now because...</i>

761
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:52,445
<i>we finally have
communication with him...</i>

762
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:55,581
<i>and a viable rescue plan.</i>

763
00:58:55,582 --> 00:58:57,617
<i>We'll give you a write-up
of what happened,</i>

764
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:59,184
<i>a full write-up of everything.</i>

765
00:58:59,185 --> 00:59:00,887
<i>But it's not your fault.</i>

766
00:59:00,888 --> 00:59:03,957
<i>Mark stresses that
every time it comes up.</i>

767
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:07,394
<i>So... Yeah...</i>

768
00:59:09,062 --> 00:59:11,597
<i>Take some time to absorb this.</i>

769
00:59:11,598 --> 00:59:14,300
<i>And send all the questions you want.</i>

770
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,203
<i>We'll answer them.</i>

771
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:19,206
<i>All right. Henderson out.</i>

772
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:21,308
Holy shit, he's alive.

773
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:23,276
I left him behind.

774
00:59:23,277 --> 00:59:24,311
- No.
- No.

775
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:26,146
We all left together.

776
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:28,281
You were following orders.

777
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:34,020
I left him behind.

778
00:59:43,464 --> 00:59:44,363
<i>So now that
NASA can talk to me,</i>

779
00:59:44,364 --> 00:59:46,166
<i>they won't shut up.</i>

780
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:48,936
<i>They want constant updates
on every Hab system...</i>

781
00:59:48,937 --> 00:59:50,669
<i>and they got a room full of people</i>

782
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,639
<i>trying to micromanage my crops.</i>

783
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,575
<i>Which is awesome.</i>

784
00:59:55,275 --> 00:59:57,544
<i>Look, I don't mean to sound
arrogant or anything...</i>

785
00:59:57,545 --> 01:00:02,383
<i>but I am the greatest
botanist on this planet, so...</i>

786
01:00:03,384 --> 01:00:04,885
<i>One big bonus</i>

787
01:00:04,886 --> 01:00:06,887
<i>to this communication
with NASA again...</i>

788
01:00:06,888 --> 01:00:08,521
<i>is the email. I'm getting them again.</i>

789
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:10,890
<i>Big data dumps like when
I was on the</i> Hermes.

790
01:00:10,891 --> 01:00:12,959
<i>I even got one from the president.</i>

791
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,628
<i>The coolest one, though,
the coolest one I got...</i>

792
01:00:15,629 --> 01:00:16,863
<i>was from University of Chicago,</i>

793
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:18,631
<i>my alma mater.</i>

794
01:00:18,632 --> 01:00:21,300
They say that once you
grow crops somewhere...

795
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:23,503
you've officially colonized it.

796
01:00:24,004 --> 01:00:26,607
<i>So, technically...</i>

797
01:00:27,274 --> 01:00:29,175
<i>I colonized Mars.</i>

798
01:00:33,614 --> 01:00:36,083
In your face, Neil Armstrong.

799
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:38,517
In other news, there's been a request...

800
01:00:38,518 --> 01:00:40,253
for me to pose for a photograph

801
01:00:40,254 --> 01:00:42,622
on my next transmission.

802
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,590
I'm trying to figure out whether

803
01:00:44,591 --> 01:00:47,459
I should go with "High School Senior"...

804
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,765
or "coquettish ingenue."

805
01:00:52,466 --> 01:00:53,867
But I'm not really sure

806
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:55,788
how that's gonna look with my spacesuit on.

807
01:01:21,395 --> 01:01:23,130
Hey!

808
01:01:25,165 --> 01:01:26,932
What is he doing?

809
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,202
I asked for a photo,
and what, he's The Fonz?

810
01:01:29,203 --> 01:01:31,003
<i>Just be grateful we got
you something, Annie.</i>

811
01:01:31,004 --> 01:01:33,173
I can't use this,
Vincent, and you know that.

812
01:01:33,174 --> 01:01:34,673
I need a picture of his face.

813
01:01:34,674 --> 01:01:36,409
<i>I could tell him to
take off his helmet...</i>

814
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:37,977
but then he'd, you know, die, so...

815
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,680
<i>We'll release the photo</i>

816
01:01:40,681 --> 01:01:41,981
<i>when we detail the rescue operation.</i>

817
01:01:41,982 --> 01:01:43,816
I want to announce we're launching

818
01:01:43,817 --> 01:01:45,117
some supplies to him next year...

819
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,320
during the Hohmann Transfer Window.

820
01:01:47,321 --> 01:01:49,689
Bruce, your team's still on schedule?

821
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,624
<i>It'll be tight, but we'll make it.</i>

822
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:53,526
Nine-month travel time.

823
01:01:53,527 --> 01:01:55,994
That puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868.

824
01:01:55,995 --> 01:01:58,097
Did we get the botany team's analysis?

825
01:01:58,098 --> 01:02:01,602
<i>Yeah, they estimate Mark's
crops will last till Sol 912.</i>

826
01:02:01,603 --> 01:02:04,137
<i>They grudgingly admit that
he's doing great work.</i>

827
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:05,470
Grudgingly?

828
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,506
<i>Yeah. Mark has a tendency to tell them</i>

829
01:02:06,507 --> 01:02:07,740
<i>to have sex with themselves...</i>

830
01:02:07,741 --> 01:02:09,709
<i>whenever they question
one of his decisions.</i>

831
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,811
Get him in line, Vincent.

832
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:12,711
We can't afford any miscommunication.

833
01:02:12,712 --> 01:02:14,381
I hate this margin.

834
01:02:14,382 --> 01:02:18,285
912 Sols worth of food.
We get there on 868.

835
01:02:18,852 --> 01:02:21,589
And that's assuming nothing goes wrong.

836
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:09,168
<i>Suit breach detected.</i>

837
01:03:16,777 --> 01:03:19,712
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

838
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:35,929
<i>Oxygen level, 10%.</i>

839
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:53,279
<i>Oxygen level, 5%.</i>

840
01:04:02,355 --> 01:04:04,557
<i>Suit pressure, stable.</i>

841
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:02,542
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

842
01:06:35,676 --> 01:06:38,979
God! God, God, God, God!

843
01:06:57,498 --> 01:06:59,631
Crops are dead.

844
01:06:59,632 --> 01:07:01,966
Complete loss of pressure
boiled off most of the water.

845
01:07:01,967 --> 01:07:03,369
Any bacteria that survived,

846
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:05,171
died in the subzero temperatures...

847
01:07:05,172 --> 01:07:07,106
when exposed to Mars' atmosphere.

848
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,975
How long does he have?

849
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:11,910
He can still
eat the potatoes he has,

850
01:07:11,911 --> 01:07:14,380
he just can't grow any more...

851
01:07:14,381 --> 01:07:17,117
so give him 200 sols.

852
01:07:17,118 --> 01:07:20,253
Rations get him to what? Sol 409?

853
01:07:20,254 --> 01:07:23,222
Mmm-hmm. So with potatoes, 609.

854
01:07:23,223 --> 01:07:26,126
So by Sol 868, he'll be long dead.

855
01:07:26,127 --> 01:07:27,959
We're gonna have to launch
as soon as possible...

856
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,729
which changes our travel time.

857
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,698
Yeah, we're working on it.

858
01:07:33,366 --> 01:07:37,836
Prelim estimates call for a 414-day trip.

859
01:07:37,837 --> 01:07:40,240
It's Sol 135 now.

860
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:42,407
We need 13 days to mount the boosters,

861
01:07:42,408 --> 01:07:43,843
perform inspections...

862
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:47,146
which gives Bruce and his team...

863
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:49,850
47 days to make this probe.

864
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:54,488
I'll let you call Bruce, give him the news.

865
01:07:56,824 --> 01:07:58,759
Okay.

866
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:04,664
I'm gonna need a change of clothes.

867
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:15,108
<i>"Dear Mark...</i>

868
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:19,913

874
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:49,909

876
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:54,548
Oh, Jesus.

01:08:55,648 --> 01:08:57,049

01:09:01,956 --> 01:09:05,125

Rich.

899
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:37,803
Wake up.

900
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:42,509
Sorry, but they're asking
for the probe courses.

901
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:44,009
What time is it?

902
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,345
It's 3:42.

903
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:54,119
Look, I know we're coming
at this backwards...

904
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,821
but we can't commit to a firm launch date

905
01:12:55,822 --> 01:12:57,758
with this many unknowns.

906
01:12:58,224 --> 01:13:00,459
It's all right. Um...

907
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,295
All 25 models for launch will
take 414 days to reach Mars.

908
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,098
They vary slightly in thrust duration...

909
01:13:05,099 --> 01:13:07,067
and the fuel requirement
is nearly identical.

910
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:10,269
Not a good time to launch, is it?

911
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:13,205
Yeah, Earth and Mars are
really badly positioned.

912
01:13:13,206 --> 01:13:15,375
Heck, it'd almost be easier if you...

913
01:13:17,911 --> 01:13:19,379
Almost easier to what?

914
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:22,048
I need more coffee.

915
01:13:22,049 --> 01:13:23,781
Ahh!

916
01:13:23,782 --> 01:13:24,817
Are you all right?

917
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:26,253
It's fine.

918
01:13:30,157 --> 01:13:32,359
Almost easier to what?

919
01:13:43,569 --> 01:13:46,006
You do understand I'm your boss, right?

920
01:13:46,572 --> 01:13:48,007
Uh-huh.

921
01:13:51,211 --> 01:13:52,577
All right, let's ask

922
01:13:52,578 --> 01:13:55,281
the very, very expensive question.

923
01:13:55,748 --> 01:13:57,549
Is the probe going to be ready on time?

924
01:13:57,550 --> 01:13:59,485
<i>- We're behind.</i>
- Give me a number.

925
01:13:59,486 --> 01:14:02,988
<i>15 days. 15 days and I can get it done.</i>

926
01:14:02,989 --> 01:14:04,188
All right, let's create 15 days.

927
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:05,857
13 days to mount the probe.

928
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,526
Can we reduce?

929
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,661
It actually only takes three
days to mount the probe.

930
01:14:09,662 --> 01:14:11,563
And we can get that down to two, right?

931
01:14:11,564 --> 01:14:13,299
<i>I can get it down to two.</i>

932
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,000
10 days are for tests and inspections.

933
01:14:15,001 --> 01:14:17,903
How often do those
inspections reveal a problem?

934
01:14:18,906 --> 01:14:20,705
Are you suggesting we
don't do the inspections?

935
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,875
Right now I'm asking how
often they reveal a problem.

936
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:24,242
One in 20.

937
01:14:24,243 --> 01:14:25,878
But that's grounds for countdown halt.

938
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:27,345
We can't take that chance.

939
01:14:27,346 --> 01:14:29,915
Anyone else know a safer
way to buy more time?

940
01:14:34,019 --> 01:14:36,621
Dr. Keller, stretch Watney's
rations four more days.

941
01:14:36,622 --> 01:14:38,290
You're not gonna like it,
but that'll get us to 15.

942
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:39,090
And we'll cancel the inspections.

943
01:14:39,091 --> 01:14:40,558
Teddy.

944
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,428
- Sir, if that ever got out...
- It's on me.

945
01:14:42,429 --> 01:14:43,829
You got your two weeks.

946
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,432
Get it done.

947
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:48,466
So, now I have to hold out

948
01:14:48,467 --> 01:14:50,568
until the probe gets here with more food.

949
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:53,205
You want to see what minimal
calorie count looks like?

950
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:55,006
Standard issue ration.

951
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:59,277
But instead of three of
these every one day...

952
01:14:59,278 --> 01:15:03,082
I'm now eating one of
these every three days.

953
01:15:04,317 --> 01:15:06,453
And now, they've asked me...

954
01:15:07,019 --> 01:15:08,622
to do that.

955
01:15:13,059 --> 01:15:14,628
The point is...

956
01:15:15,862 --> 01:15:19,199
<i>"stretch the rations four more days"...</i>

957
01:15:19,966 --> 01:15:22,101
<i>is a real dick-punch.</i>

958
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:28,909
<i>I'm gonna dip this potato
in some crushed Vicodin.</i>

959
01:15:30,477 --> 01:15:32,512
And there's nobody who can stop me.

960
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:46,092
<i>It has been seven days
since I ran out of ketchup.</i>

961
01:15:57,738 --> 01:16:00,272
Up. Up, up. Yeah.

962
01:16:00,273 --> 01:16:02,407
Let's go up here.

963
01:16:02,408 --> 01:16:04,008
Labels facing up.

964
01:16:08,881 --> 01:16:10,182
This is the flight director.

965
01:16:10,183 --> 01:16:12,050
Begin launch status check.

966
01:16:12,051 --> 01:16:14,754
Roger that, Flight.
Beginning launch status check.

967
01:16:14,755 --> 01:16:17,123
Do you believe in God, Vincent?

968
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:19,391
Yeah.

969
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,794
Yeah, my father was a Hindu,

970
01:16:21,795 --> 01:16:24,263
my mother's a Baptist, so, yeah...

971
01:16:24,264 --> 01:16:26,299
I believe in several.

972
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,835
We'll take all the help we can get.

973
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,470
<i>Launch status check complete.</i>

974
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:34,106
This is Flight.

975
01:16:34,107 --> 01:16:35,840
We are go for launch.

976
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:36,909
<i>Proceeding with the count.</i>

977
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,376
<i>10... 9...</i>

978
01:16:38,377 --> 01:16:39,879

<i>Liftoff.</i>

985
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:53,560
<i>Good thrust.</i>

986
01:16:57,229 --> 01:16:59,064
<i>Performance is nominal.</i>

987
01:17:12,613 --> 01:17:15,048
<i>The tail
is giving good data.</i>

988
01:17:16,282 --> 01:17:17,817
<i>She's rock
solid at this point, Flight.</i>

989
01:17:17,818 --> 01:17:19,018
<i>TVCs look good.</i>

990
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,283
We're getting a little shimmy, Flight.

991
01:17:32,832 --> 01:17:34,732
Say again?

992
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:37,001
We are getting a very large precession.

993
01:17:37,002 --> 01:17:38,471
Are we good?

994
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,139
<i>Flight,
it's hitting the redline.</i>

995
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,743
It's spinning on the long axis
around a 17-degree precession.

996
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,545
Launch, what's happening?

997
01:17:46,546 --> 01:17:48,847
Force on Iris is 7 G's.

998
01:17:48,848 --> 01:17:51,368
We've lost
readings on the probe, Flight.

999
01:17:54,153 --> 01:17:57,390
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1000
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:02,127
We've lost it, Flight.

1001
01:18:05,398 --> 01:18:06,831
SatCon?

1002
01:18:06,832 --> 01:18:07,966

<i>for the standard rations.</i>

1034
01:20:24,638 --> 01:20:26,604
<i>The thrust of the launch combined</i>

01:20:26,605 --> 01:20:28,439
<i>with the simultaneous

<i>Vincent, why wasn't this addressed</i>

1038
01:20:34,613 --> 01:20:36,482
<i>in the inspections phase?</i>

1039
01:20:36,483 --> 01:20:38,082
<i>In order to make our launch window,</i>

1040
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,619
<i>we were forced to
accelerate our schedule.</i>

1041
01:20:41,741 --> 01:20:45,165
Their astronaut is going to die.

1042
01:20:45,658 --> 01:20:48,486
Of course there are other ways...

1043
01:20:49,184 --> 01:20:52,553
...the Taiyang Shen booster.
Our engineers have run the numbers,

1044
01:20:53,115 --> 01:20:56,021
and it has enough fuel for
a Mars injection orbit.

1045
01:20:56,758 --> 01:20:58,403
Why hasn't NASA approached us?

1046
01:20:58,554 --> 01:20:59,690
They don't know.

1047
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:02,668
Our booster technology is classified.

1048
01:21:05,113 --> 01:21:06,113
So if we do nothing...

1049
01:21:08,753 --> 01:21:13,703
The world would never
know we could have helped.

1050
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:16,663
Then, for the sake of argument,

1051
01:21:17,403 --> 01:21:19,638
let's say we decide to help them...

1052
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:24,656
We'd be giving up a booster and effectively
cancelling Taiyang Shen.

1053
01:21:24,657 --> 01:21:27,696
We need to keep this among scientists,

1054
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:30,081
a co-operation between space agencies.

1055
01:21:32,337 --> 01:21:33,739
Yes.

1056
01:21:34,773 --> 01:21:36,942
Yes, I understand.

1057
01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:41,446
Thank you.

1058
01:21:44,449 --> 01:21:45,651
Yes!

1059
01:21:46,952 --> 01:21:48,120
<i>All right.</i>

1060
01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:49,853
Thanks to my uncle Tommy in China,

1061
01:21:49,854 --> 01:21:51,990
we get another chance at this.

1062
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:55,293
Now, we finished the
<i>Iris</i> probe in 62 days.

1063
01:21:55,294 --> 01:21:58,864
We are now gonna attempt
to finish it in 28.

1064
01:22:24,323 --> 01:22:25,622
We can jettison any kind of landing system.

1065
01:22:25,623 --> 01:22:27,058
We're only sending rations.

1066
01:22:27,059 --> 01:22:29,328
We can crash-land on Mars.

1067
01:22:30,162 --> 01:22:32,031
You should hang up the phone.

1068
01:22:32,032 --> 01:22:33,898
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- My name is Rich Purnell.

1069
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:35,200
I work in Astrodynamics,

1070
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,121
and you should hang up the phone right now.

1071
01:22:38,504 --> 01:22:39,905
All right, all right.

1072
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:42,040
I'm gonna call you back.

1073
01:22:43,108 --> 01:22:44,876
I know how to save Mark Watney.

1074
01:22:46,078 --> 01:22:48,446
Your probe plan won't work.
Too many things can go wrong.

1075
01:22:48,447 --> 01:22:49,513
I've got a better way.

1076
01:22:49,514 --> 01:22:50,682
Astrodynamics?

1077
01:22:50,683 --> 01:22:52,784
Yeah.

1078
01:22:52,785 --> 01:22:55,687
What the hell is "Project Elrond"?

1079
01:22:55,688 --> 01:22:56,621
I had to make something up.

1080
01:22:56,622 --> 01:22:58,656
But "Elrond"?

1081
01:22:58,657 --> 01:23:00,726
Because it's a secret meeting.

1082
01:23:00,727 --> 01:23:01,994
How do you know that?

1083
01:23:01,995 --> 01:23:03,629
Why does "Elrond" mean "secret meeting"?

1084
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:06,231
<i>The Council of Elrond. It's
from</i> Lord of the Rings.

1085
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:07,332
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

1086
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:08,532
It's the meeting where they decide

1087
01:23:08,533 --> 01:23:09,867
to destroy the One Ring.

1088
01:23:09,868 --> 01:23:11,503
<i>If we're gonna call
something "Project Elrond"...</i>

1089
01:23:11,504 --> 01:23:13,906
I would like my code
name to be "Glorfindel."

1090
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:16,174
Okay, I hate every one of you.

1091
01:23:16,175 --> 01:23:18,509
What, Teddy doesn't
even know about this yet?

1092
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:19,978
I'm sorry, who are you?

1093
01:23:19,979 --> 01:23:21,939
This is Rich
Purnell, Astrodynamics.

1094
01:23:22,782 --> 01:23:24,415
Tell them what you just told me.

1095
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,787
I can get the <i>Hermes</i>
back to Mars by Sol 561.

1096
01:23:29,189 --> 01:23:30,590
How?

1097
01:23:34,394 --> 01:23:37,463
Could you stand right there for me, please?

1098
01:23:38,531 --> 01:23:39,764
Thanks.

1099
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,267
Right there. Great.

1100
01:23:41,268 --> 01:23:45,671
And could you stand
right there? Right there.

1101
01:23:50,242 --> 01:23:53,778
Okay, let's pretend that this
stapler is the <i>Hermes...</i>

1102
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,281
and you are...

1103
01:23:56,282 --> 01:23:57,816
I'm sorry, what's your name again?

1104
01:23:57,817 --> 01:24:01,586
Teddy. I'm the Director of NASA.

1105
01:24:01,587 --> 01:24:04,055
Cool. Teddy, you're Earth.

1106
01:24:04,056 --> 01:24:06,390
And right now, the <i>Hermes</i>
is headed towards you...

1107
01:24:06,391 --> 01:24:08,861
starting its month-long
deceleration to intercept.

1108
01:24:08,862 --> 01:24:11,330
But instead, what I'm proposing is...

1109
01:24:15,335 --> 01:24:17,768
we start accelerating immediately

1110
01:24:17,769 --> 01:24:19,705
to preserve velocity and gain even more.

1111
01:24:19,706 --> 01:24:20,772
We don't intercept with Earth at all...

1112
01:24:20,773 --> 01:24:22,272
but we come close enough

1113
01:24:22,273 --> 01:24:24,576
to get a gravity assist and adjust course.

1114
01:24:24,577 --> 01:24:26,779
While we're doing that...

1115
01:24:28,613 --> 01:24:30,482
we resupply with the probe...

1116
01:24:30,483 --> 01:24:31,750
The <i>Taiyang Shen.</i>

1117
01:24:31,751 --> 01:24:33,384
...pick up whatever provisions we need...

1118
01:24:33,385 --> 01:24:35,487
and now we're accelerating towards Mars.

1119
01:24:37,889 --> 01:24:39,590
You're Mars.

1120
01:24:39,591 --> 01:24:40,858
Now, we're going too fast

1121
01:24:40,859 --> 01:24:42,626
at this point to fall into orbit...

1122
01:24:42,627 --> 01:24:44,062
but we can do a flyby.

1123
01:24:44,063 --> 01:24:45,263
<i>What good is a flyby</i>

1124
01:24:45,264 --> 01:24:47,264
<i>if we can't get Watney off the surface?</i>

1125
01:24:47,265 --> 01:24:50,134
Watney would intercept using the MAV.

1126
01:24:50,135 --> 01:24:51,671
Ow!

1127
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,774
And then we just head home.

1128
01:25:01,247 --> 01:25:03,950
I've done the math. It checks out.

1129
01:25:05,283 --> 01:25:06,751
<i>- Rich.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1130
01:25:06,752 --> 01:25:07,818
Get out.

1131
01:25:07,819 --> 01:25:09,489
All right.

1132
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:17,429
- Is he right?
- Yeah.

1133
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:20,031
Bruce, what do you think?

1134
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:21,900
<i>Well, if Vincent says so.</i>

1135
01:25:23,001 --> 01:25:25,137
We need to use the <i>Taiyang Shen?</i>

1136
01:25:25,138 --> 01:25:26,537
Uh-huh.

1137
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:28,673
What am I missing? Why is that important?

1138
01:25:28,674 --> 01:25:30,207
Because we can only do one.

1139
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,443
Send Watney enough food to
last till <i>Ares 4...</i>

1140
01:25:32,444 --> 01:25:35,112
or send <i>Hermes</i>
back to get him right now.

1141
01:25:35,113 --> 01:25:36,147
Both plans require the <i>Taiyang Shen,</i>

1142
01:25:36,148 --> 01:25:38,450
so we have to choose.

1143
01:25:38,451 --> 01:25:40,085
But what about the <i>Hermes</i> crew?

1144
01:25:40,086 --> 01:25:41,952
We'd be asking them to add

1145
01:25:41,953 --> 01:25:45,456
533 extra days to their mission.

1146
01:25:45,457 --> 01:25:47,497
Yeah. They wouldn't
hesitate, not for a second.

1147
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:50,094
Can the <i>Hermes</i> function for 533 days

1148
01:25:50,095 --> 01:25:51,296
beyond the scheduled mission end?

1149
01:25:51,297 --> 01:25:52,464
It should.

1150
01:25:52,465 --> 01:25:54,633
Built to last the full <i>Ares</i> mission...

1151
01:25:54,634 --> 01:25:57,235
so technically, it's only
halfway through its lifespan.

1152
01:25:57,236 --> 01:25:58,637
But if something goes wrong...

1153
01:25:58,638 --> 01:26:00,472
Then we lose the crew.

1154
01:26:00,473 --> 01:26:01,973
<i>So what? We
either have a high chance</i>

1155
01:26:01,974 --> 01:26:04,142
<i>of killing one person...</i>

1156
01:26:04,143 --> 01:26:06,745
<i>or a low chance of killing six people.</i>

1157
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:08,146
<i>How do we make that decision?</i>

1158
01:26:08,147 --> 01:26:09,848
We don't have to make it, Bruce.

1159
01:26:09,849 --> 01:26:11,582
He does.

1160
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,085
Yeah, well, bullshit.

1161
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:15,086
It should be Commander Lewis' call.

1162
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:16,921
We still have a chance to bring

1163
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,456
five astronauts home safe and sound.

1164
01:26:18,457 --> 01:26:20,560
I'm not risking their lives.

1165
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,195
Let them make that decision.

1166
01:26:23,729 --> 01:26:26,698
Mitch, we're going with option one.

1167
01:26:28,067 --> 01:26:30,636
You goddamn coward.

1168
01:26:48,388 --> 01:26:51,356
<i>- Johanssen?
- Yeah.</i>

1169
01:26:51,357 --> 01:26:53,791
I know it's your private time.
Can I bother you for a second?

1170
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:54,826
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1171
01:26:54,827 --> 01:26:55,693
<i>Where are you?</i>

1172
01:26:55,694 --> 01:26:57,195
The gym.

1173
01:27:18,617 --> 01:27:20,152
What's up?

1174
01:27:20,153 --> 01:27:21,353
I just got an email from my wife

1175
01:27:21,354 --> 01:27:24,522
and the subject line says, "Our children."

1176
01:27:24,523 --> 01:27:26,892
My computer won't open the attachment.

1177
01:27:27,727 --> 01:27:29,126
Okay.

1178
01:27:29,127 --> 01:27:30,829
Let's take a look.

1179
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,868
Uh...

1180
01:27:36,769 --> 01:27:38,237
Let's see.

1181
01:27:40,104 --> 01:27:42,607
This isn't a JPEG.

1182
01:27:42,608 --> 01:27:45,378
It's a plain ASCII text file.

1183
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,960
I don't really know what we're looking at.

1184
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:52,718
Does that make any sense to you?

1185
01:27:54,653 --> 01:27:57,156
"Rich Purnell Maneuver."

1186
01:27:57,157 --> 01:28:00,125
It's a course maneuver for the <i>Hermes.</i>

1187
01:28:05,398 --> 01:28:07,832
And the mission concludes
with Earth intercept,

1188
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:09,267
211 days later.

1189
01:28:10,336 --> 01:28:12,370
Would it work?

1190
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:14,305
Mmm-hmm. We ran the
numbers. They check out.

1191
01:28:14,306 --> 01:28:15,941
It's a brilliant course.

1192
01:28:15,942 --> 01:28:19,077
So why all the cloak and dagger?

1193
01:28:19,078 --> 01:28:20,879
Because it goes directly
against NASA's decision.

1194
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,048
Yeah. If we do the maneuver,

1195
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:25,250
they'd have to send the
supply ship or we die.

1196
01:28:25,251 --> 01:28:28,788
We have the opportunity
to force their hand.

1197
01:28:29,354 --> 01:28:32,190
So, are we gonna do it?

1198
01:28:33,324 --> 01:28:35,326
If it was up to me, we'd
already be on our way.

1199
01:28:35,327 --> 01:28:37,963
But it is, though, isn't it? Up to you.

1200
01:28:37,964 --> 01:28:39,330
Not this time.

1201
01:28:39,331 --> 01:28:42,468
This is something NASA expressly rejected.

1202
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,036
We're talking about mutiny here,

1203
01:28:45,037 --> 01:28:46,504
which is not a word that I take lightly.

1204
01:28:46,505 --> 01:28:49,374
So we do this together or not at all.

1205
01:28:49,375 --> 01:28:52,509
And before you answer,
consider the consequences.

1206
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:55,613
If we mess up the supply
rendezvous, we die.

1207
01:28:55,614 --> 01:28:58,515
If we mess up the Earth
gravity assist, we die.

1208
01:28:58,516 --> 01:29:01,719
If we do everything perfectly...

1209
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:05,189
we add 533 days to our mission.

1210
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:09,161
533 more days before we
see our families again.

1211
01:29:09,162 --> 01:29:13,798
533 days of unplanned space travel...

1212
01:29:13,799 --> 01:29:15,433
where anything could go wrong.

1213
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:19,205
If it's mission critical, we die.

1214
01:29:19,639 --> 01:29:20,972
Sign me up.

1215
01:29:20,973 --> 01:29:22,406
All right, cowboy, slow down.

1216
01:29:22,407 --> 01:29:24,543
You and I, we're military.

1217
01:29:24,544 --> 01:29:26,044
Chances are, we go home,
they'll court martial us.

1218
01:29:26,045 --> 01:29:27,245
Yeah, there's that.

1219
01:29:27,246 --> 01:29:28,679
And for the rest of you guys...

1220
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,582
I guarantee they will never
send you back up here again.

1221
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:36,153
Good. So, if we go for
it, how would it work?

1222
01:29:36,154 --> 01:29:37,789
I plot the course and execute it.

1223
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:39,290
Remote override.

1224
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,357
They could take over the <i>Hermes</i>

1225
01:29:40,358 --> 01:29:42,093
from Mission Control.

1226
01:29:42,929 --> 01:29:45,263
Can you disable it?

1227
01:29:45,264 --> 01:29:47,432
<i>Hermes</i> has four
redundant flight computers...

1228
01:29:47,433 --> 01:29:49,867
each connected to three
redundant comm systems.

1229
01:29:49,868 --> 01:29:51,202
We can't shut down the comms

1230
01:29:51,203 --> 01:29:52,737
because we'd lose telemetry and guidance.

1231
01:29:52,738 --> 01:29:54,472
And we can't shut down the computers

1232
01:29:54,473 --> 01:29:56,407
because we need to run the ship.

1233
01:29:56,408 --> 01:29:59,878
I'd have to disable remote
override on each system.

1234
01:29:59,879 --> 01:30:01,912
It's part of the OS, I'd
have to jump over the code.

1235
01:30:01,913 --> 01:30:04,883
Okay, but, like, in English,
what would that mean?

1236
01:30:06,251 --> 01:30:08,119
I can do it.

1237
01:30:08,621 --> 01:30:10,156
Great.

1238
01:30:11,424 --> 01:30:13,292
Well, it has to be unanimous.

1239
01:30:13,826 --> 01:30:18,864
If we do this, it'll be
over 900 days of space.

1240
01:30:20,799 --> 01:30:24,835
That's more than enough
space for one life...

1241
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:26,705
so, yes.

1242
01:30:26,706 --> 01:30:28,440
I vote yes.

1243
01:30:30,309 --> 01:30:32,311
Let's go get him.

1244
01:30:34,746 --> 01:30:36,481
Johanssen?

1245
01:30:36,482 --> 01:30:37,948
Yes.

1246
01:30:37,949 --> 01:30:39,116
Yeah!

1247
01:30:41,819 --> 01:30:44,455
Got an unscheduled status
update from <i>Hermes.</i>

1248
01:30:44,456 --> 01:30:45,689
Roger. Read it out.

1249
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,559
Message reads, "Houston, please be advised.

1250
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,128
"Rich Purnell is a
steely-eyed missile man."

1251
01:30:50,129 --> 01:30:51,528
What?

1252
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,030
Flight, Guidance.

1253
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:55,165
<i>Hermes</i> is off-course.

1254
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:56,401
CAPCOM, advise <i>Hermes</i> they're drifting.

1255
01:30:56,402 --> 01:30:58,268
Guidance, get a correction ready.

1256
01:30:58,269 --> 01:30:59,269
Negative, Flight,

1257
01:30:59,270 --> 01:31:00,871
it's not drift. They've adjusted course.

1258
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:02,506
What the hell?

1259
01:31:02,507 --> 01:31:05,710
Telemetry, any chance this
is instrumentation failure?

1260
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,445
Negative, Flight.

1261
01:31:07,446 --> 01:31:08,580
Guidance, work at how long they can stay

1262
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:10,447
on this course before it's irreversible.

1263
01:31:10,448 --> 01:31:12,116
Working on that now, Flight.

1264
01:31:12,117 --> 01:31:14,018
Hey. Who's Rich Purnell?

1265
01:31:14,019 --> 01:31:15,987
I dunno.

1266
01:31:15,988 --> 01:31:18,723
Will somebody find out who
the hell Rich Purnell is?

1267
01:31:18,724 --> 01:31:20,625
Annie will go before
the media this morning...

1268
01:31:20,626 --> 01:31:22,361
and inform them of NASA's decision

1269
01:31:22,362 --> 01:31:25,295
to reroute the <i>Hermes</i> to Mars.

1270
01:31:25,296 --> 01:31:27,332
Sounds like a smart move.

1271
01:31:28,032 --> 01:31:31,001
Considering the circumstances.

1272
01:31:31,002 --> 01:31:35,606
Whoever gave them the maneuver
only passed along information.

1273
01:31:35,607 --> 01:31:37,642
Crew made the decision on their own.

1274
01:31:39,211 --> 01:31:41,347
You may have killed them, Mitch.

1275
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:45,183
We're fighting the same war.

1276
01:31:45,184 --> 01:31:46,518
Every time something goes wrong,

1277
01:31:46,519 --> 01:31:48,385
the world forgets why we fly.

1278
01:31:48,386 --> 01:31:50,155
I'm trying to keep us airborne.

1279
01:31:50,156 --> 01:31:52,357
It's bigger than one person.

1280
01:31:53,893 --> 01:31:55,661
No.

1281
01:31:55,662 --> 01:31:57,096
It's not.

1282
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:02,000
When this is over, I'll
expect your resignation.

1283
01:32:04,937 --> 01:32:06,438
I understand.

1284
01:32:06,439 --> 01:32:09,241
Bring our astronauts home.

1285
01:32:12,211 --> 01:32:15,013
Every <i>Ares</i> mission requires
three years of pre-supplies.

1286
01:32:15,014 --> 01:32:17,682
So NASA decided a long time
ago it's a lot easier...

1287
01:32:17,683 --> 01:32:19,116
to send some of the stuff beforehand

1288
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:20,552
rather than bring it with us.

1289
01:32:20,553 --> 01:32:24,156
So, as a result, the MAV for <i>Ares 4...</i>

1290
01:32:24,157 --> 01:32:25,523
is already there

1291
01:32:25,524 --> 01:32:27,692
at the Schiaparelli Crater, just waiting.

1292
01:32:27,693 --> 01:32:31,429
So the plan is for me to
use that to go into orbit...

1293
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:34,465
just as the <i>Hermes</i> is passing...

1294
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:38,136
and I guess they catch me?

1295
01:32:38,737 --> 01:32:40,705
In space.

1296
01:32:43,675 --> 01:32:46,111
So, I've got 200 sols to figure out...

1297
01:32:46,112 --> 01:32:48,946
how to take everything here
that's keeping me alive...

1298
01:32:48,947 --> 01:32:50,615
the oxygenator, the water reclaimer,

1299
01:32:50,616 --> 01:32:52,616
the atmospheric regulator...

1300
01:32:52,617 --> 01:32:54,853
<i>bring that all with me.</i>

1301
01:32:54,854 --> 01:32:57,220
<i>And luckily, I have the greatest minds</i>

1302
01:32:57,221 --> 01:32:58,789
<i>on Planet Earth...</i>

1303
01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:01,692
<i>really, all of the brainpower
on the entire planet...</i>

1304
01:33:01,693 --> 01:33:03,728
<i>helping me with this endeavor.</i>

1305
01:33:03,729 --> 01:33:05,563
<i>And so far they've come up with...</i>

1306
01:33:05,564 --> 01:33:06,697
<i>"Hey, why don't you drill holes</i>

1307
01:33:06,698 --> 01:33:08,299
<i>"on the roof of your Rover...</i>

1308
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,234
<i>"and hit it as hard as
you can with a rock?"</i>

1309
01:33:11,269 --> 01:33:13,437
We're gonna get there.

1310
01:33:33,524 --> 01:33:35,492
<i>  Didn't know what time it was</i>

1311
01:33:35,493 --> 01:33:38,728
<i>  And the lights were low</i>

1312
01:33:38,729 --> 01:33:42,232
<i>  I leaned back on my radio</i>

1313
01:33:44,236 --> 01:33:46,938
<i>  Some cat was layin'
down some rock 'n' roll</i>

1314
01:33:46,939 --> 01:33:48,607
<i>  Lotta soul, he said</i>

1315
01:33:50,942 --> 01:33:55,580
<i>  Then the loud sound did seem to fade</i>

1316
01:33:55,581 --> 01:34:00,652
<i>  Came back like a slow
voice on a wave of phase</i>

1317
01:34:00,653 --> 01:34:05,491
<i>  That weren't no DJ
That was hazy cosmic jive</i>

1318
01:34:08,827 --> 01:34:12,897
<i>  There's a starman
waiting in the sky  </i>

1319
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:15,332
<i>533 days longer?</i>

1320
01:34:15,333 --> 01:34:17,535
<i>And you said yes to this?</i>

1321
01:34:17,536 --> 01:34:19,537
He would have done the
same for me. You know that.

1322
01:34:25,644 --> 01:34:27,512
Cheese. You do "cheese"?

1323
01:34:27,513 --> 01:34:28,780
Cheese.

1324
01:34:30,282 --> 01:34:31,415
He didn't do "cheese."

1325
01:34:31,416 --> 01:34:33,151
Did he do "cheese"?

1326
01:34:40,725 --> 01:34:41,992
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

1327
01:34:41,993 --> 01:34:43,227
Hey.

1328
01:34:43,228 --> 01:34:45,028
<i>I got something for you.</i>

1329
01:34:45,029 --> 01:34:46,530
<i>Found it in the flea market.</i>

1330
01:34:46,531 --> 01:34:48,400
<i>Original pressing.</i>

1331
01:34:49,001 --> 01:34:50,300
No!

1332
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:52,571
<i>Not a scratch.</i>

1333
01:34:52,572 --> 01:34:54,371
I love it.

1334
01:34:54,372 --> 01:34:57,608
All due respect to your CNSA protocol...

1335
01:34:57,609 --> 01:35:00,010
but we haven't done things that way...

1336
01:35:00,011 --> 01:35:01,778
since <i>Apollo 9.</i>

1337
01:35:03,315 --> 01:35:04,749
Did he get that?

1338
01:35:10,122 --> 01:35:14,692
<i>  Look out your window
I can see his light</i>

1339
01:35:14,693 --> 01:35:17,729
<i>  If we can sparkle
He may land tonight  </i>

1340
01:35:19,064 --> 01:35:21,299
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

1341
01:35:23,935 --> 01:35:25,369
Mmm-hmm.

1342
01:35:26,939 --> 01:35:28,171
Oh!

1343
01:35:28,172 --> 01:35:32,443
<i>  There's a starman waiting in the sky</i>

1344
01:35:34,513 --> 01:35:35,879
<i>  He'd like to come and meet us</i>

1345
01:35:35,880 --> 01:35:37,848
<i>  But he thinks he'd blow our minds</i>

1346
01:35:37,849 --> 01:35:41,451
<i>  There's a starman waiting in the sky</i>

1347
01:35:44,189 --> 01:35:45,188
<i>  He's told us not to blow it</i>

1348
01:35:45,189 --> 01:35:47,392
<i>  'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile</i>

1349
01:35:47,393 --> 01:35:50,795
<i>  He told me Let the children lose it</i>

1350
01:35:50,796 --> 01:35:54,299
<i>  Let the children use it
Let all the children boogie</i>

1351
01:35:56,033 --> 01:35:59,504
<i>  There's a starman waiting in the sky</i>

1352
01:35:59,505 --> 01:36:02,072
<i>  He'd like to come and meet us</i>

1353
01:36:02,073 --> 01:36:04,174
<i>  But he thinks he'd blow our minds</i>

1354
01:36:04,175 --> 01:36:09,214
<i>  There's a starman waiting in the sky</i>

1355
01:36:09,215 --> 01:36:11,147
<i>  He's told us not to blow it</i>

1356
01:36:11,148 --> 01:36:13,718
<i>  'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile</i>

1357
01:36:13,719 --> 01:36:16,687
<i>  He told me Let the children lose it</i>

1358
01:36:17,288 --> 01:36:19,624
<i>  Let the children use it</i>

1359
01:36:19,625 --> 01:36:22,494
<i>  Let all the children boogie</i>

1360
01:36:31,069 --> 01:36:35,540
<i>  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

1361
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:40,077
<i>  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

1362
01:36:40,078 --> 01:36:44,616
<i>  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

1363
01:36:44,617 --> 01:36:49,420
<i>  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

1364
01:36:49,421 --> 01:36:53,825
<i>  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

1365
01:36:53,826 --> 01:36:58,362
<i>  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

1366
01:36:58,363 --> 01:37:03,835
<i>  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

1367
01:37:03,836 --> 01:37:07,905
<i>  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la</i>

1368
01:37:07,906 --> 01:37:12,578
<i>  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  </i>

1369
01:38:15,006 --> 01:38:17,608
<i>I've been thinking
about laws on Mars.</i>

1370
01:38:17,609 --> 01:38:18,808
<i>There's an international treaty</i>

1371
01:38:18,809 --> 01:38:20,878
<i>saying no country can lay claim...</i>

1372
01:38:20,879 --> 01:38:22,313
<i>to anything that's not on Earth.</i>

1373
01:38:22,314 --> 01:38:23,647
<i>And by another treaty,</i>

1374
01:38:23,648 --> 01:38:25,549
<i>if you're not in any
country's territory...</i>

1375
01:38:25,550 --> 01:38:26,918
<i>maritime law applies.</i>

1376
01:38:26,919 --> 01:38:30,688
<i>So Mars is international waters.</i>

1377
01:38:30,689 --> 01:38:34,091
<i>Now, NASA is an American
non-military organization.</i>

1378
01:38:34,092 --> 01:38:35,392
<i>It owns the Hab.</i>

1379
01:38:35,393 --> 01:38:37,961
<i>But the second I walk outside,
I'm in international waters.</i>

1380
01:38:37,962 --> 01:38:39,897
<i>So here's the cool part.</i>

1381
01:38:39,898 --> 01:38:41,366
<i>I'm about to leave for
the Schiaparelli Crater...</i>

1382
01:38:41,367 --> 01:38:43,433
where I'm gonna commandeer
the <i>Ares 4</i> lander.

1383
01:38:43,434 --> 01:38:46,704
Nobody explicitly gave me
permission to do this...

1384
01:38:46,705 --> 01:38:49,173
<i>and they can't until
I'm on board the</i> Ares 4.

1385
01:38:49,174 --> 01:38:51,643
<i>So that means I'm gonna
be taking a craft over...</i>

1386
01:38:51,644 --> 01:38:53,945
<i>in international waters
without permission.</i>

1387
01:38:53,946 --> 01:38:57,915
<i>Which, by definition,
makes me a pirate.</i>

1388
01:38:58,649 --> 01:39:02,720
<i>Mark Watney, Space Pirate.</i>

1389
01:39:31,715 --> 01:39:33,851
A Space Pirate.

1390
01:40:34,278 --> 01:40:38,715
<i>Everywhere I go, I'm the first.</i>

1391
01:40:38,716 --> 01:40:41,152
<i>It's a strange feeling.</i>

1392
01:40:41,153 --> 01:40:42,853
<i>Step outside the Rover...</i>

1393
01:40:42,854 --> 01:40:45,254
<i>first guy to be there.</i>

1394
01:40:45,255 --> 01:40:48,760
<i>Climb that hill, first guy to do that.</i>

1395
01:40:49,327 --> 01:40:51,394
<i>Four and a half billion years...</i>

1396
01:40:51,395 --> 01:40:53,563
<i>nobody here.</i>

1397
01:40:53,564 --> 01:40:56,767
<i>And now, me.</i>

1398
01:40:57,868 --> 01:41:01,640
<i>I'm the first person to be
alone on an entire planet.</i>

1399
01:41:16,388 --> 01:41:18,255
How's he doing?

1400
01:41:19,425 --> 01:41:21,159
So far, so good.

1401
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,794
He's sticking to schedule.

1402
01:41:23,795 --> 01:41:26,696
Drives for four hours before noon...

1403
01:41:26,697 --> 01:41:28,098
lays the solar panels,

1404
01:41:28,099 --> 01:41:30,233
waits 13 hours for them to recharge...

1405
01:41:30,234 --> 01:41:34,739
and sleeps somewhere in
there and then starts again.

1406
01:41:36,541 --> 01:41:37,942
How's he doing?

1407
01:41:39,944 --> 01:41:42,980
He asked us to call
him Captain Blondebeard.

1408
01:41:44,683 --> 01:41:46,784
Well, technically, Mars
would be under maritime...

1409
01:41:46,785 --> 01:41:48,552
Yeah, I know. He explained it to us.

1410
01:41:49,988 --> 01:41:51,622
Where is he?

1411
01:41:52,456 --> 01:41:53,857
- There.
- Okay.

1412
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:55,459
Here.

1413
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:56,928
Okay.

1414
01:43:41,366 --> 01:43:43,466
<i>Okay, I'm gonna start by
stating for the record</i>

1415
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:45,035
<i>that you're not gonna like this.</i>

1416
01:43:45,036 --> 01:43:46,671
Oh, yeah?

1417
01:43:47,139 --> 01:43:49,741
Yeah, the problem is
the intercept velocity.

1418
01:43:49,742 --> 01:43:54,644
The <i>Hermes,</i> well...
It can't enter Mars' orbit.

1419
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:58,014
Otherwise, they'll never have
enough fuel to make it home.

1420
01:43:58,015 --> 01:44:00,049
The MAV, that was only designed

1421
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:02,719
to get to low Mars orbit.

1422
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:06,823
So in order for Mark to escape
Mars' gravity entirely...

1423
01:44:06,824 --> 01:44:08,392
and to intercept the <i>Hermes...</i>

1424
01:44:08,393 --> 01:44:10,393
- He has to be going fast.
- Exactly.

1425
01:44:10,394 --> 01:44:12,597
<i>Which means we need to
make the MAV lighter.</i>

1426
01:44:12,598 --> 01:44:15,265
<i>A lot lighter. 5,000 kilograms lighter.</i>

1427
01:44:15,266 --> 01:44:16,700
You can do that, right?

1428
01:44:16,701 --> 01:44:18,634
<i>There's some gimmes right off the bat.</i>

1429
01:44:18,635 --> 01:44:20,237
<i>The design presumes 500 kilograms</i>

1430
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:21,906
<i>of Martian soil and samples.</i>

1431
01:44:21,907 --> 01:44:23,706
Obviously we won't do that.

1432
01:44:23,707 --> 01:44:27,545
And there's just one
passenger instead of six.

1433
01:44:27,546 --> 01:44:30,281
With suits and gear, that's another 500?

1434
01:44:30,282 --> 01:44:32,549
Ditch the life support, don't need it.

1435
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:34,384
And we'll get Mark to wear
his EVA suit the whole trip.

1436
01:44:34,385 --> 01:44:36,120
Wait a second. If he's in his EVA suit,

1437
01:44:36,121 --> 01:44:37,455
how is he gonna operate the controls?

1438
01:44:37,456 --> 01:44:39,889
Well, he won't.

1439
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:43,759
Martinez will pilot the MAV
remotely from the <i>Hermes.</i>

1440
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,664
We've never had a manned ship
controlled remotely before.

1441
01:44:47,831 --> 01:44:50,201
But I am excited about

1442
01:44:50,202 --> 01:44:52,536
the opportunities that affords.

1443
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:55,004
If we go remote, we can
lose the control panels,

1444
01:44:55,005 --> 01:44:56,807
the secondary and tertiary comm systems.

1445
01:44:56,808 --> 01:44:58,107
<i>Wait a second.</i>

1446
01:44:58,108 --> 01:45:02,179
<i>You want a remote-controlled
ascent with no backup comms?</i>

1447
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:06,851
He's not even got to the
bad stuff yet, Vincent.

1448
01:45:06,852 --> 01:45:08,518
Let's skip to the bad stuff!

1449
01:45:08,519 --> 01:45:10,353
We need to remove the nose airlock,

1450
01:45:10,354 --> 01:45:13,457
the windows, and Hull Panel 19.

1451
01:45:14,992 --> 01:45:16,125
You want to take the front of the ship off?

1452
01:45:16,126 --> 01:45:17,693
<i>Sure.</i>

1453
01:45:17,694 --> 01:45:20,597
<i>The nose airlock alone
is 400 kilograms.</i>

1454
01:45:20,598 --> 01:45:21,964
You want to send a man into space

1455
01:45:21,965 --> 01:45:22,966
without the front of his ship?

1456
01:45:22,967 --> 01:45:24,703
<i>Well, no.</i>

1457
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:28,840
<i>We're gonna have him
cover it with Hab canvas.</i>

1458
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:33,043
<i>Look, the hull's mostly
there to keep the air in.</i>

1459
01:45:33,044 --> 01:45:34,611
Mars' atmosphere is so thin,

1460
01:45:34,612 --> 01:45:36,412
you don't need a lot of streamlining.

1461
01:45:36,413 --> 01:45:37,947
By the time the ship's going fast enough

1462
01:45:37,948 --> 01:45:39,750
for air resistance to matter...

1463
01:45:39,751 --> 01:45:42,385
it'll be high enough that
there's practically no air.

1464
01:45:42,386 --> 01:45:44,821
You wanna send him into space under a tarp.

1465
01:45:44,822 --> 01:45:47,057
<i>Yes.</i>

1466
01:45:47,058 --> 01:45:48,858
<i>Can I go on?</i>

1467
01:45:48,859 --> 01:45:50,427
No.

1468
01:45:56,434 --> 01:45:59,068
You think he means it like...

1469
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:01,071
"Are you kidding me?"

1470
01:46:01,072 --> 01:46:02,505
- You know?
- Mmm-hmm.

1471
01:46:02,506 --> 01:46:06,043
Or like, "Are you kidding me?"

1472
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:08,211
I think it might be the second one.

1473
01:46:08,212 --> 01:46:09,912
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1474
01:46:09,913 --> 01:46:12,182
Could be the first way.

1475
01:46:12,183 --> 01:46:13,852
"Are you kidding me?"

1476
01:46:14,385 --> 01:46:16,421
Yeah, it could be the first way.

1477
01:46:40,412 --> 01:46:43,479
<i>I know what they're doing.</i>

1478
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,183
I know exactly what they're doing.

1479
01:46:46,184 --> 01:46:48,419
They just keep repeating...

1480
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:51,388
"Go faster than any man in
the history of space travel."

1481
01:46:51,389 --> 01:46:52,822
<i>Like that's a good thing.</i>

1482
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:55,260
<i>Like it'll distract me from
how insane their plan is.</i>

1483
01:46:56,461 --> 01:46:58,094
Yeah, I get to go faster than any man

1484
01:46:58,095 --> 01:47:00,296
in the history of space travel...

1485
01:47:00,297 --> 01:47:03,133
because you are launching
me in a convertible.

1486
01:47:03,134 --> 01:47:04,934
Actually it's worse than that

1487
01:47:04,935 --> 01:47:06,970
because I won't even be
able to control the thing.

1488
01:47:06,971 --> 01:47:09,772
<i>And by the way, physicists,</i>

1489
01:47:09,773 --> 01:47:12,543
<i>when describing things
like acceleration...</i>

1490
01:47:12,544 --> 01:47:15,046
<i>do not use the word "fast."</i>

1491
01:47:15,613 --> 01:47:17,747
So they're only doing that in the hopes

1492
01:47:17,748 --> 01:47:20,250
that I won't raise any objections...

1493
01:47:20,818 --> 01:47:23,320
to this lunacy.

1494
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:25,656
<i>Because I like the way</i>

1495
01:47:25,657 --> 01:47:28,827
<i>"fastest man in the history
of space travel" sounds.</i>

1496
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:32,497
<i>I do like the way it sounds.</i>

1497
01:47:33,264 --> 01:47:35,499
<i>I mean, I like it a lot.</i>

1498
01:47:37,602 --> 01:47:40,171
<i>I'm not gonna tell them that.</i>

1499
01:47:45,775 --> 01:47:47,278
<i>Okay.</i>

1500
01:47:48,346 --> 01:47:50,481
<i>Let's do this.</i>

1501
01:47:55,953 --> 01:47:57,787
<i>  My, my</i>

1502
01:47:57,788 --> 01:48:02,125
<i>  At Waterloo Napoleon did surrender</i>

1503
01:48:02,693 --> 01:48:04,594
<i>  Oh, yeah</i>

1504
01:48:04,595 --> 01:48:10,235
<i>  And I have met my destiny
in quite a similar way</i>

1505
01:48:11,269 --> 01:48:17,141
<i>  The history book on the
shelf is always repeating itself</i>

1506
01:48:19,410 --> 01:48:21,111
<i>  Waterloo</i>

1507
01:48:21,112 --> 01:48:24,281
<i>  I was defeated You won the war</i>

1508
01:48:25,081 --> 01:48:26,951
Come on.

1509
01:48:26,952 --> 01:48:30,622
<i>  Waterloo, promise
to love you forevermore</i>

1510
01:48:32,322 --> 01:48:36,627
<i>  Waterloo Couldn't
escape if I wanted to</i>

1511
01:48:38,796 --> 01:48:40,298
<i>  Waterloo</i>

1512
01:48:40,299 --> 01:48:42,633
<i>  Knowing my fate is to be with you</i>

1513
01:48:43,568 --> 01:48:46,371
<i>  Oh, oh, oh, oh, Waterloo</i>

1514
01:48:47,037 --> 01:48:50,007
<i>  Finally facing my Waterloo</i>

1515
01:48:53,745 --> 01:48:55,245
<i>  My, my</i>

1516
01:48:56,180 --> 01:48:58,881
<i>  I tried to hold you back</i>

1517
01:48:58,882 --> 01:49:01,117
<i>  But you were stronger</i>

1518
01:49:01,118 --> 01:49:02,520
<i>  Oh, yeah</i>

1519
01:49:03,187 --> 01:49:08,125
<i>  And now it seems my only
chance is giving up the fight</i>

1520
01:49:09,594 --> 01:49:12,729
<i>  And how could I ever refuse?</i>

1521
01:49:12,730 --> 01:49:16,034
<i>  I feel like I win when I lose</i>

1522
01:49:17,835 --> 01:49:19,670
<i>  Waterloo</i>

1523
01:49:19,671 --> 01:49:22,607
<i>  I was defeated You won the war</i>

1524
01:49:24,341 --> 01:49:26,610
<i>  Waterloo</i>

1525
01:49:26,611 --> 01:49:29,379
<i>  Promise to love you forevermore</i>

1526
01:49:31,014 --> 01:49:32,683
<i>  Waterloo</i>

1527
01:49:32,684 --> 01:49:35,353
<i>  Couldn't escape if I wanted to</i>

1528
01:49:38,022 --> 01:49:39,490
<i>  Waterloo</i>

1529
01:49:39,491 --> 01:49:42,659
<i>  Knowing my fate is to be with you</i>

1530
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:45,062
<i>  Oh, oh, oh, oh, Waterloo</i>

1531
01:49:45,696 --> 01:49:48,598
<i>  Finally facing my Waterloo</i>

1532
01:49:49,466 --> 01:49:52,002
<i>  Ooh, Waterloo</i>

1533
01:49:52,770 --> 01:49:55,504
<i>  Knowing my fate is to be with you</i>

1534
01:49:55,505 --> 01:49:59,109
<i>  Oh, oh, oh, oh, Waterloo  </i>

1535
01:50:21,666 --> 01:50:23,733
<i>Beck, Vogel, I
want you guys in Airlock 2</i>

1536
01:50:23,734 --> 01:50:25,001
<i>with the outer door open...</i>

1537
01:50:25,002 --> 01:50:26,969
<i>- before the MAV even launches.
- Okay.</i>

1538
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:30,674
<i>Martinez flies the MAV,
Johanssen sysops the ascent.</i>

1539
01:50:30,675 --> 01:50:32,608
<i>Once we hit intercept,</i>

1540
01:50:32,609 --> 01:50:34,544
<i>it's Beck's job to go get Watney.</i>

1541
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:35,745
We're ready.

1542
01:50:35,746 --> 01:50:37,382
What's the intercept plan?

1543
01:50:38,049 --> 01:50:40,383
We finished attaching the
tethers into one long line.

1544
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,486
It's 214 meters long.

1545
01:50:42,487 --> 01:50:43,754
And I'll have the MMU,

1546
01:50:43,755 --> 01:50:45,522
so moving around should be easy.

1547
01:50:45,523 --> 01:50:47,557
How fast a relative
velocity can you handle?

1548
01:50:48,425 --> 01:50:50,994
I can grab the MAV at 5 meters per second.

1549
01:50:50,995 --> 01:50:53,429
10 is like jumping onto a moving train.

1550
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:55,397
So any more than that and I might miss.

1551
01:50:55,398 --> 01:50:57,534
Well, we may have some leeway.

1552
01:50:58,736 --> 01:51:00,804
The launch takes 12 minutes.

1553
01:51:00,805 --> 01:51:04,308
And it'll be 52 minutes before intercept.

1554
01:51:04,309 --> 01:51:06,777
Once Mark's engine shuts off...

1555
01:51:06,778 --> 01:51:09,278
we'll know our intercept
point and velocity.

1556
01:51:09,279 --> 01:51:11,115
Vogel, you're Beck's backup.

1557
01:51:11,116 --> 01:51:13,817
Everything goes well, you pull
them on board with the tether.

1558
01:51:13,818 --> 01:51:16,487
If anything goes wrong,
you go out after him.

1559
01:51:16,488 --> 01:51:17,821
Yep.

1560
01:51:17,822 --> 01:51:19,256
Okay.

1561
01:51:21,192 --> 01:51:23,694
Let's go get our boy.

1562
01:52:24,788 --> 01:52:26,688
There's a mood
of tension and anxiety here,

1563
01:52:26,689 --> 01:52:28,191
outside Johnson Space Center.

1564
01:52:28,192 --> 01:52:29,460
As you can see,

1565
01:52:29,461 --> 01:52:30,759
many people have gathered here...

1566
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:32,128
to see whether or not

1567
01:52:32,129 --> 01:52:36,366
the mission to retrieve Mark
Watney will be a success.

1568
01:52:36,367 --> 01:52:38,201
<i>They've had some contact with him,</i>

1569
01:52:38,202 --> 01:52:40,237
<i>but it hasn't been very much.</i>

1570
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:41,604
<i>We have to remind our viewers</i>

1571
01:52:41,605 --> 01:52:43,505
<i>that we're watching this as it unfolds.</i>

1572
01:52:43,506 --> 01:52:45,442
<i>So we'll try and keep you up-to-date</i>

1573
01:52:45,443 --> 01:52:47,411
<i>as to what exactly is going on.</i>

1574
01:52:47,412 --> 01:52:51,113
<i>Let's listen in to NASA making
contact with Mark Watney.</i>

1575
01:52:51,114 --> 01:52:52,682
<i>Let's listen in.</i>

1576
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:01,624
If something goes wrong,
what can Mission Control do?

1577
01:53:01,625 --> 01:53:04,628
Not a damn thing.

1578
01:53:04,629 --> 01:53:06,597
It's all happening 12
light-minutes away...

1579
01:53:06,598 --> 01:53:08,197
which means it takes 24 minutes for them

1580
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:10,467
to get the answer to any question they ask.

1581
01:53:11,301 --> 01:53:13,604
The whole launch is 12 minutes...

1582
01:53:14,872 --> 01:53:16,874
so they're on their own.

1583
01:54:22,005 --> 01:54:22,872
<i>...just how
long Mark has been</i>

1584
01:54:22,873 --> 01:54:24,273
<i>completely alone on Mars.</i>

1585
01:54:24,274 --> 01:54:27,444
<i>We're talking to a psychology
expert later to discuss...</i>

1586
01:54:49,934 --> 01:54:51,701
<i>Fuel pressure, green.</i>

1587
01:54:51,702 --> 01:54:54,036
Engine alignment, perfect.

1588
01:54:54,037 --> 01:54:55,705
<i>Communications, five by five.</i>

1589
01:54:57,273 --> 01:55:00,210
<i>We are ready for pre-flight
checklist, Commander.</i>

1590
01:55:00,211 --> 01:55:02,746
<i>Mission Control, this
is</i> Hermes <i>actual.</i>

1591
01:55:02,747 --> 01:55:05,049
<i>We will proceed on schedule.</i>

1592
01:55:05,050 --> 01:55:06,883
<i>We are T-minus 2 minutes, 10 seconds</i>

1593
01:55:06,884 --> 01:55:08,753
<i>to launch, by the mark.</i>

1594
01:55:09,653 --> 01:55:10,821
About two minutes, Watney.

1595
01:55:10,822 --> 01:55:12,055
<i>How you doing down there?</i>

1596
01:55:12,056 --> 01:55:14,022
I'm good.

1597
01:55:14,023 --> 01:55:16,491
I'm anxious to get up to you.

1598
01:55:16,492 --> 01:55:17,861
Thanks for coming back for me.

1599
01:55:17,862 --> 01:55:19,196
<i>Well, we're on it.</i>

1600
01:55:19,197 --> 01:55:20,830
<i>Remember, you'll be
pulling some serious G's,</i>

1601
01:55:20,831 --> 01:55:22,732
<i>so it's okay to pass out.</i>

1602
01:55:22,733 --> 01:55:24,934
You're in Martinez's hands now.

1603
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:27,304
Well, tell that asshole no barrel rolls.

1604
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:30,439
Copy that, MAV.

1605
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:31,607
<i>CAPCOM.</i>

1606
01:55:31,608 --> 01:55:32,809
<i>Go.</i>

1607
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:33,742
<i>Remote command.</i>

1608
01:55:33,743 --> 01:55:34,777
<i>Go.</i>

1609
01:55:34,778 --> 01:55:35,845
<i>Recovery.</i>

1610
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:37,045
<i>Go.</i>

1611
01:55:37,046 --> 01:55:38,514
<i>Secondary recovery.</i>

1612
01:55:38,515 --> 01:55:39,515
<i>Go.</i>

1613
01:55:39,516 --> 01:55:41,017
Pilot.

1614
01:55:41,986 --> 01:55:43,186
Go.

1615
01:55:43,187 --> 01:55:44,621
<i>Pilot.</i>

1616
01:55:44,622 --> 01:55:46,054
<i>Go.</i>

1617
01:55:46,055 --> 01:55:47,935
<i>Copy. We're go.</i>

1618
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:50,761
<i>Mission Control,
we are go for launch.</i>

1619
01:55:51,196 --> 01:55:52,394
T-minus ten...

1620
01:55:52,395 --> 01:55:53,563
nine...

1621
01:55:53,564 --> 01:55:54,731
Main engine start.

1622
01:55:54,732 --> 01:55:56,198
<i>Eight...</i>

1623
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:57,466
<i>seven...</i>

1624
01:55:57,467 --> 01:55:59,268
<i>Mooring clamps released.</i>

1625
01:55:59,269 --> 01:56:01,004
About five seconds, Watney. Hang on.

1626
01:56:01,005 --> 01:56:02,872
I'll see you in a few, Commander.

1627
01:56:02,873 --> 01:56:04,506
<i>Four...</i>

1628
01:56:04,507 --> 01:56:06,174
<i>three...</i>

1629
01:56:06,175 --> 01:56:07,643
<i>two...</i>

1630
01:56:07,644 --> 01:56:09,347
<i>one.</i>

1631
01:56:45,215 --> 01:56:47,651
Velocity, 741 meters per second.

1632
01:56:47,652 --> 01:56:49,719
Altitude, 1350 meters.

1633
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:51,021
That's too low.

1634
01:56:51,022 --> 01:56:52,690
It's fighting me.

1635
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:59,429
<i>Watney, do you read?</i>

1636
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:06,902
<i>Booster separation complete.</i>

1637
01:57:06,903 --> 01:57:10,040
Velocity, 850. Altitude, 1843.

1638
01:57:10,041 --> 01:57:11,375
He's well below target altitude.

1639
01:57:11,376 --> 01:57:13,043
How far below?

1640
01:57:13,044 --> 01:57:14,643
Checking.

1641
01:57:14,644 --> 01:57:16,580
Watney.

1642
01:57:16,581 --> 01:57:18,080
Do you read?

1643
01:57:18,081 --> 01:57:19,381
<i>He's probably passed out.</i>

1644
01:57:19,382 --> 01:57:20,616
<i>He pulled 12 g's on the ascent.</i>

1645
01:57:20,617 --> 01:57:21,951
<i>Give him a few minutes.</i>

1646
01:57:21,952 --> 01:57:23,621
<i>Copy that.</i>

1647
01:57:25,723 --> 01:57:27,490
<i>Main shutdown in three...</i>

1648
01:57:27,491 --> 01:57:29,726
<i>two, one...</i>

1649
01:57:29,727 --> 01:57:31,195
<i>shutdown.</i>

1650
01:57:32,529 --> 01:57:34,431
<i>Back to automatic guidance.</i>

1651
01:57:34,864 --> 01:57:36,667
<i>Shutdown confirmed.</i>

1652
01:57:38,736 --> 01:57:40,870
<i>Fuel reserves depleted.</i>

1653
01:57:42,406 --> 01:57:43,973
<i>Watney?</i>

1654
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:45,775
<i>Do you read?</i>

1655
01:57:46,410 --> 01:57:47,643
<i>It seems there's some sort of problem</i>

1656
01:57:47,644 --> 01:57:49,579
<i>with the transmission.</i>

1657
01:57:56,252 --> 01:57:58,188
<i>I have interval pings.</i>

1658
01:57:58,189 --> 01:58:00,022
Intercept velocity will
be 11 meters per second.

1659
01:58:00,023 --> 01:58:02,192
I can make that work.

1660
01:58:02,727 --> 01:58:05,228
Distance at intercept will be...

1661
01:58:05,229 --> 01:58:07,464
We'll be 68 kilometers apart.

1662
01:58:07,465 --> 01:58:09,566
<i>68 kilometers?</i>

1663
01:58:09,567 --> 01:58:12,203
<i>Did she just say 68 kilometers?</i>

1664
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:13,702
Come on, guys, keep it together.

1665
01:58:13,703 --> 01:58:15,105
Work the problem.

1666
01:58:15,538 --> 01:58:17,906
Johanssen, time to intercept?

1667
01:58:17,907 --> 01:58:20,077
<i>39 minutes, 12 seconds.</i>

1668
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:21,911
Martinez, what if we point our thrusters

1669
01:58:21,912 --> 01:58:23,713
in the same direction?

1670
01:58:23,714 --> 01:58:26,983
Well, it depends how much
fuel you wanna save...

1671
01:58:26,984 --> 01:58:28,116
for the altitude adjustments
for the trip home.

1672
01:58:28,117 --> 01:58:29,518
How much do you need?

1673
01:58:29,519 --> 01:58:34,090
I can get by with about
20% of what we have left.

1674
01:58:35,059 --> 01:58:38,327
If we use 75.5% of remaining
altitude-adjust fuel...

1675
01:58:38,328 --> 01:58:40,196
that will bring the
intercept range to zero.

1676
01:58:40,197 --> 01:58:41,664
Do it.

1677
01:58:42,199 --> 01:58:45,602
Hang on. It brings the range to zero...

1678
01:58:45,603 --> 01:58:48,204
but the intercept velocity
will be 42 meters per second.

1679
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:50,473
<i>And that's way too fast.</i>

1680
01:58:50,474 --> 01:58:52,474
Then we'll have 39 minutes to figure out

1681
01:58:52,475 --> 01:58:54,278
how to slow down.

1682
01:58:57,014 --> 01:58:58,915
Martinez, burn the jets.

1683
01:58:58,916 --> 01:59:00,784
Copy that.

1684
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:24,840
MAV to <i>Hermes.</i>

1685
01:59:24,841 --> 01:59:26,008
<i>Watney?</i>

1686
01:59:26,009 --> 01:59:27,009
<i>Affirmative.</i>

1687
01:59:31,114 --> 01:59:32,881
<i>What's your status?</i>

1688
01:59:32,882 --> 01:59:34,851
<i>My chest hurts.</i>

1689
01:59:34,852 --> 01:59:37,019
<i>I broke my ribs.</i>

1690
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:38,454
<i>How are you?</i>

1691
01:59:38,455 --> 01:59:39,555
<i>We're working on getting to you.</i>

1692
01:59:39,556 --> 01:59:41,058
<i>There was a complication during launch.</i>

1693
01:59:41,059 --> 01:59:42,992
Copy that.

1694
01:59:42,993 --> 01:59:45,027
How bad is it?

1695
01:59:45,028 --> 01:59:46,530
<i>We've corrected
the intercept range,</i>

1696
01:59:46,531 --> 01:59:48,665
<i>but we've got a problem
with intercept velocity.</i>

1697
01:59:48,666 --> 01:59:49,933
<i>How big a problem?</i>

1698
01:59:49,934 --> 01:59:51,701
42 meters a second.

1699
01:59:51,702 --> 01:59:53,203
Well...

1700
01:59:53,938 --> 01:59:56,006
shit.

1701
02:00:00,678 --> 02:00:02,579
<i>Commander, I have an idea.</i>

1702
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:04,313
<i>Go ahead, Mark.</i>

1703
02:00:04,314 --> 02:00:07,549
Well, if I can find
something sharp in here...

1704
02:00:07,550 --> 02:00:10,554
and poke a hole in the
glove of my EVA suit...

1705
02:00:10,555 --> 02:00:13,022
I could use the escaping
air as a thruster...

1706
02:00:13,023 --> 02:00:14,756
<i>and fly towards you.</i>

1707
02:00:14,757 --> 02:00:18,227
<i>It would be easy to control
because it would be on my arm.</i>

1708
02:00:18,228 --> 02:00:20,063
I can't see you having
any control if you did that.

1709
02:00:20,064 --> 02:00:21,997
You'd be eyeballing the intercept

1710
02:00:21,998 --> 02:00:24,433
using a thrust vector
you can barely control.

1711
02:00:24,434 --> 02:00:28,170
Yes, those are all very good points.

1712
02:00:28,171 --> 02:00:31,341
But consider this.

1713
02:00:33,210 --> 02:00:35,844
I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.

1714
02:00:37,014 --> 02:00:38,813
<i>Commander...</i>

1715
02:00:38,814 --> 02:00:40,883
<i>let's go Iron Man.</i>

1716
02:00:43,586 --> 02:00:45,287
<i>This is unexpected LOS.</i>

1717
02:00:45,288 --> 02:00:47,368
<i>Communication lost. Stand by.</i>

1718
02:00:48,024 --> 02:00:50,893
Maybe it's not the worst idea.

1719
02:00:50,894 --> 02:00:52,762
No, it is the worst idea.
It's the worst idea ever.

1720
02:00:52,763 --> 02:00:54,063
Not what he said.

1721
02:00:54,064 --> 02:00:56,667
Using atmosphere as thrust.

1722
02:00:58,469 --> 02:01:00,670
What happens if we blow the VAL?

1723
02:01:00,671 --> 02:01:02,705
Wait, you want to open
the vehicular airlock?

1724
02:01:02,706 --> 02:01:04,040
It'll give us a good kick.

1725
02:01:04,041 --> 02:01:06,108
But also blow the nose off the ship.

1726
02:01:06,109 --> 02:01:09,012
And all the air would leave
and we need air to not die.

1727
02:01:09,013 --> 02:01:11,247
We would seal the bridge
and the reactor room.

1728
02:01:11,248 --> 02:01:12,881
Everywhere else would go vacuo.

1729
02:01:12,882 --> 02:01:14,183
Vogel.

1730
02:01:14,184 --> 02:01:16,085
<i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>

1731
02:01:16,086 --> 02:01:19,121
I need you to come
inside and make a... bomb.

1732
02:01:19,122 --> 02:01:20,223
Again, Commander?

1733
02:01:20,224 --> 02:01:21,524
<i>You're a chemist.</i>

1734
02:01:21,525 --> 02:01:23,694
<i>Can you make a bomb with
what you have on board?</i>

1735
02:01:24,795 --> 02:01:26,664
Probably.

1736
02:01:27,229 --> 02:01:28,664
But I feel obliged to mention

1737
02:01:28,665 --> 02:01:30,700
that setting off an explosive device...

1738
02:01:30,701 --> 02:01:33,670
<i>in a spacecraft is a
terrible, terrible idea.</i>

1739
02:01:33,671 --> 02:01:36,772
Hang on. You guys making a bomb without me?

1740
02:01:36,773 --> 02:01:39,108
<i>Copy that. Can you do it?</i>

1741
02:01:40,944 --> 02:01:42,445
<i>Ja.</i>

1742
02:01:45,116 --> 02:01:47,049
<i>Houston, be advised.</i>

1743
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:48,317
<i>We are going to
deliberately breach the VAL</i>

1744
02:01:48,318 --> 02:01:50,254
<i>to produce a reverse thrust.</i>

1745
02:01:51,354 --> 02:01:53,756
Beck, leave your suit on.
Meet Johanssen in Airlock 1.

1746
02:01:53,757 --> 02:01:55,157
We'll open the outer door.

1747
02:01:55,158 --> 02:01:57,227
<i>I need you to place the
charge on the inner door.</i>

1748
02:01:57,228 --> 02:01:59,260
<i>Climb back to Airlock 2 along the hull.</i>

1749
02:01:59,261 --> 02:02:01,464
Copy. I'm on my way.

1750
02:02:08,272 --> 02:02:10,039
I'm in, Commander.

1751
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:11,408
<i>Copy that.</i>

1752
02:02:20,184 --> 02:02:22,084
Vogel, where are you?

1753
02:02:22,085 --> 02:02:23,018
<i>I'm in the kitchen.</i>

1754
02:02:23,019 --> 02:02:24,721
Okay.

1755
02:02:28,190 --> 02:02:29,459
<i>Commander...</i>

1756
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:31,393
I can't let you go through with this.

1757
02:02:31,394 --> 02:02:33,162
I am prepared to cut the suit.

1758
02:02:33,163 --> 02:02:34,696
Absolutely not.

1759
02:02:34,697 --> 02:02:37,399
<i>See, the thing is, I'm selfish.</i>

1760
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:39,969
I want all the memorials
back home to be about me.

1761
02:02:39,970 --> 02:02:41,336
<i>Just me.</i>

1762
02:02:41,337 --> 02:02:43,738
I should have left this guy on Mars.

1763
02:02:43,739 --> 02:02:45,241
Hey.

1764
02:02:47,644 --> 02:02:48,711
Sugar?

1765
02:02:48,712 --> 02:02:50,213
Yeah.

1766
02:02:53,916 --> 02:02:55,951
Can you hold this?

1767
02:02:55,952 --> 02:02:58,088
Liquid oxygen...

1768
02:02:58,089 --> 02:03:01,825
and some stain remover
that contains ammonia.

1769
02:03:05,028 --> 02:03:08,298
This thing here is five times stronger

1770
02:03:08,299 --> 02:03:09,765
than a stick of dynamite.

1771
02:03:09,766 --> 02:03:11,367
How do we activate it?

1772
02:03:11,368 --> 02:03:14,270
Can you connect this to
one of our lighting panels?

1773
02:03:17,273 --> 02:03:19,142
Careful.

1774
02:03:25,247 --> 02:03:27,183
Open Airlock 1.

1775
02:03:32,689 --> 02:03:34,249
I'm on the way to Beck.

1776
02:03:38,295 --> 02:03:39,896
Let's just hope this is a good idea, guys.

1777
02:03:39,897 --> 02:03:41,162
It is.

1778
02:03:41,163 --> 02:03:42,865
<i>Open A1.</i>

1779
02:03:47,705 --> 02:03:49,138
- Hi.
- Hey.

1780
02:03:52,309 --> 02:03:54,311
- You got it?
- Mmm.

1781
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:02,519
Make sure you're not in here
when this thing goes off.

1782
02:04:03,854 --> 02:04:05,287
Hey.

1783
02:04:05,288 --> 02:04:07,189
Be careful out there.

1784
02:04:07,190 --> 02:04:08,991
In space.

1785
02:04:12,595 --> 02:04:15,364
Don't tell anyone I did that.

1786
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:26,310
Bomb set.

1787
02:04:34,717 --> 02:04:37,421
Leaving Airlock 1.

1788
02:04:42,158 --> 02:04:43,326
Guys, I'm running the numbers,

1789
02:04:43,327 --> 02:04:44,661
and even with optimal VAL blow...

1790
02:04:44,662 --> 02:04:46,594
we're gonna be off on our angle.

1791
02:04:46,595 --> 02:04:49,365
What's the intercept distance? Johanssen?

1792
02:04:49,366 --> 02:04:51,835
260 meters, approximate.

1793
02:04:51,836 --> 02:04:53,503
That's too far.

1794
02:05:02,112 --> 02:05:03,579
Commander?

1795
02:05:03,580 --> 02:05:05,982
Martinez, close the door.

1796
02:05:08,885 --> 02:05:10,887
Open D3.

1797
02:05:10,888 --> 02:05:13,123
And leave it open.

1798
02:05:41,251 --> 02:05:43,420
<i>Open B2.</i>

1799
02:05:47,157 --> 02:05:48,691

1801
02:05:51,095 --> 02:05:52,661
15 seconds.

1802
02:05:52,662 --> 02:05:55,365
We sure know how to cut it close.

1803
02:05:55,366 --> 02:05:56,631
Commander?

1804
02:05:56,632 --> 02:05:59,102
Distance is too far. I'm going out.

1805
02:05:59,103 --> 02:06:00,236
I can do this.

1806
02:06:00,237 --> 02:06:01,603
It's not a debate.

1807
02:06:01,604 --> 02:06:03,339
I'm not risking another crew member.

1808
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:05,174
Beck's returned.

1809
02:06:05,175 --> 02:06:07,143
Johanssen, initiate the bomb.

1810
02:06:07,144 --> 02:06:08,376
Ten seconds.

1811
02:06:08,377 --> 02:06:10,412
Strap in.

1812
02:06:10,413 --> 02:06:12,915
<i>Five, four...</i>

- Brace for deceleration.

1815
02:06:16,219 --> 02:06:17,452

02:06:17,453 --> 02:06:19,256
Activating Panel 41.

1817
02:06:40,943 --> 02:06:42,210
Bridge seal holding.

1818
02:06:42,211 --> 02:06:43,545
What's the damage?

1819
02:06:43,546 --> 02:06:44,746
<i>Worry about that later.</i>

1820
02:06:44,747 --> 02:06:46,447
<i>What's the relative velocity?</i>

1821
02:06:46,448 --> 02:06:47,982
12 meters per second.

1822
02:06:47,983 --> 02:06:50,384
<i>Copy.</i>

1823
02:06:51,421 --> 02:06:53,055
Hook me up.

1824
02:06:54,224 --> 02:06:56,026
Done.

1825
02:07:05,469 --> 02:07:07,571
I have visual on the MAV.

1826
02:07:08,571 --> 02:07:10,505
<i>What's the intercept range?</i>

1827
02:07:10,506 --> 02:07:12,541
I'm checking.

1828
02:07:12,542 --> 02:07:14,244
312 meters.

1829
02:07:14,245 --> 02:07:16,911
Did you say 312?

1830
02:07:16,912 --> 02:07:19,682
Great. I'll wave at you guys as I go by.

1831
02:07:22,853 --> 02:07:24,254
Oh!

1832
02:07:28,657 --> 02:07:30,625
I can't get to you, Mark. You're too far.

1833
02:07:30,626 --> 02:07:31,760
<i>I'm not gonna make it.</i>

1834
02:07:31,761 --> 02:07:32,995
I know.

1835
02:07:32,996 --> 02:07:34,930
<i>Beck, unhook me.
I'm going after him.</i>

1836
02:07:34,931 --> 02:07:37,700
Commander, I got this.

1837
02:07:51,215 --> 02:07:53,147
Mark, report.

1838
02:07:53,148 --> 02:07:54,950
On my way, Commander.

1839
02:07:54,951 --> 02:07:56,751
Damn it.

1840
02:08:06,095 --> 02:08:08,430
Johanssen, what's my
relative velocity to Mark?

1841
02:08:08,431 --> 02:08:10,465
5.2 meters per second.

1842
02:08:10,466 --> 02:08:12,468
Copy. Adjusting course.

1843
02:08:17,907 --> 02:08:20,077
<i>3.1 meters per second.</i>

1844
02:08:22,312 --> 02:08:24,681
<i>Distance to target, 24 meters.</i>

1845
02:08:26,215 --> 02:08:28,452
11 meters to target.

1846
02:08:30,953 --> 02:08:32,355
<i>Six meters.</i>

1847
02:08:42,166 --> 02:08:44,801
Hold on, Mark.

1848
02:09:12,363 --> 02:09:13,461
I got him.

1849
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:18,466
<i>I got him.</i>

1850
02:09:18,467 --> 02:09:20,068
<i>I got him.</i>

1851
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:21,872
Way to go, Iron Man.

1852
02:09:24,608 --> 02:09:26,375
Beck, pull us in.

1853
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:31,147
It's good to see you.

1854
02:09:32,349 --> 02:09:33,884
You...

1855
02:09:35,417 --> 02:09:39,488
have terrible taste in music.

1856
02:09:48,698 --> 02:09:50,465
<i>Houston, this
is</i> Hermes <i>actual.</i>

1857
02:09:50,466 --> 02:09:51,601
<i>We got him.</i>

1858
02:09:53,569 --> 02:09:55,204
<i>Watney is secure.</i>

1859
02:10:00,410 --> 02:10:02,644
Contact in
outer space with Mark Watney.

1860
02:10:02,645 --> 02:10:04,746
<i>After a very long time, they have done</i>

1861
02:10:04,747 --> 02:10:06,915
<i>what many people
thought was impossible.</i>

1862
02:10:06,916 --> 02:10:08,216
<i>Mission confirmation:</i>

1863
02:10:08,217 --> 02:10:10,919
<i>Mark Watney has been
successfully rescued.</i>

1864
02:10:14,523 --> 02:10:16,525
Grab a hold of him.

1865
02:10:18,094 --> 02:10:19,495
Hey, handsome!

1866
02:10:19,496 --> 02:10:21,531
Beck, close the hatch.

1867
02:10:24,266 --> 02:10:25,968
Hey, guys!

1868
02:10:30,474 --> 02:10:32,842
<i>Houston, six crew safely aboard.</i>

1869
02:10:37,147 --> 02:10:40,348
<i>This is huge moment for this
nation, for the world...</i>

1870
02:10:40,349 --> 02:10:43,818
<i>and indeed, for
international space travel.</i>

1871
02:10:43,819 --> 02:10:46,222
I can't believe
anything you do works.

1872
02:10:46,223 --> 02:10:47,856
Hey!

1873
02:10:49,525 --> 02:10:50,759
Oh, God.

1874
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,729
I can't believe it.

1875
02:10:53,830 --> 02:10:55,363
There's a little smell
going on over there, bud.

1876
02:10:55,364 --> 02:10:59,134
I know. I haven't had a
shower in a year and a half.

1877
02:10:59,135 --> 02:11:01,738
Don't make me laugh, I have broken ribs.

1878
02:11:35,372 --> 02:11:36,940
Hey, there.

1879
02:11:45,180 --> 02:11:47,182
- Morning, sir.
- It's an honor, sir.

1880
02:11:47,183 --> 02:11:49,085
Sir.

1881
02:11:49,086 --> 02:11:50,885
- Sir.
- Sir.

1882
02:11:50,886 --> 02:11:52,521
Morning, sir.

1883
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:16,778
<i>Welcome to the
Astronaut Candidate Program.</i>

1884
02:12:16,779 --> 02:12:18,847
Now pay attention,

1885
02:12:18,848 --> 02:12:20,982
because this could save your life.

1886
02:12:20,983 --> 02:12:22,583
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

1887
02:12:24,019 --> 02:12:26,121
Let me get a few things out
of the way, right off the bat.

1888
02:12:26,122 --> 02:12:29,659
Yes, I did in fact survive
on a deserted planet

1889
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:32,028
by farming in my own shit.

1890
02:12:32,996 --> 02:12:35,630
Yes, it's actually worse than it sounds.

1891
02:12:35,631 --> 02:12:37,633
So let's not talk about that ever again.

1892
02:12:38,835 --> 02:12:41,903
The other question I
get most frequently is...

1893
02:12:41,904 --> 02:12:44,639
"When I was up there, stranded by myself...

1894
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:47,276
"did I think I was going to die?"

1895
02:12:47,277 --> 02:12:49,111
Yes, absolutely.

1896
02:12:50,147 --> 02:12:51,546
And that's what you need to know going in

1897
02:12:51,547 --> 02:12:53,615
because it's going to happen to you.

1898
02:12:53,616 --> 02:12:57,385
This is space. It does not cooperate.

1899
02:12:57,386 --> 02:13:00,054
At some point, everything
is going to go south on you.

1900
02:13:00,055 --> 02:13:01,357
Everything is going to go south

1901
02:13:01,358 --> 02:13:02,991
and you're going to say, "This is it.

1902
02:13:02,992 --> 02:13:05,061
"This is how I end."

1903
02:13:06,095 --> 02:13:08,263
Now, you can either accept that...

1904
02:13:08,264 --> 02:13:10,632
or you can get to work.

1905
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:13,135
That's all it is.

1906
02:13:13,136 --> 02:13:15,437
You just begin.

1907
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:18,941
You do the math. You solve one problem...

1908
02:13:18,942 --> 02:13:20,642
then you solve the next one.

1909
02:13:20,643 --> 02:13:21,911
And then the next.

1910
02:13:21,912 --> 02:13:22,945
And if you solve enough problems,

1911
02:13:22,946 --> 02:13:25,013
you get to come home.

1912
02:13:25,447 --> 02:13:27,850
All right, questions?

1913
02:13:32,855 --> 02:13:34,022
<i>Once Mission Control completes</i>

1914
02:13:34,023 --> 02:13:35,156
<i>their pre-flight checks...</i>

1915
02:13:35,157 --> 02:13:37,526
<i>we'll begin launch procedures.</i>

1916
02:13:37,527 --> 02:13:39,995
<i>The</i> Ares 5 <i>team will
rendezvous with the</i> Hermes...

1917
02:13:39,996 --> 02:13:43,198
approximately 48 minutes after launch.

1918
02:13:43,199 --> 02:13:45,200
From there, they will have 414 days

1919
02:13:45,201 --> 02:13:47,235
of space travel ahead of them.

1920
02:13:47,236 --> 02:13:48,504
<i>Have the goals changed</i>

1921
02:13:48,505 --> 02:13:50,004
<i>from the previous mission...</i>

1922
02:13:50,005 --> 02:13:51,639
<i>to the</i> Ares 5 <i>program?</i>

1923
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:53,675
<i>And what do you hope to
achieve this time around?</i>

1924
02:13:53,676 --> 02:13:55,410
<i>Well, no. The goals
have always been the same</i>

1925
02:13:55,411 --> 02:13:57,113
for the <i>Ares</i> program.

1926
02:13:57,848 --> 02:13:59,247
This time, of course, we hope to bring

1927
02:13:59,248 --> 02:14:00,888
all the astronauts back at the same time.

1928
02:14:01,850 --> 02:14:02,718

1930
02:14:05,189 --> 02:14:06,821
This is Flight.

1931
02:14:06,822 --> 02:14:08,857
We are go for launch, on schedule.

live without you by my side</i>

1952
02:16:18,287 --> 02:16:20,388
<i>  But then I spent so many nights</i>

1953
02:16:20,389 --> 02:16:22,624
<i>  Thinking how you did me wrong</i>

1954
02:16:22,625 --> 02:16:26,961
<i>  And I grew strong and
I learned how to get along</i>

1955
02:16:26,962 --> 02:16:30,499
<i>  And so you're back from outer space</i>

1956
02:16:30,500 --> 02:16:32,401
<i>  I just walked in to find you here</i>

1957
02:16:32,402 --> 02:16:34,536
<i>  With that sad look upon your face</i>

1958
02:16:34,537 --> 02:16:37,104
<i>  I should have
changed that stupid lock</i>

1959
02:16:37,105 --> 02:16:39,040
<i>  I should have made you leave your key</i>

1960
02:16:39,041 --> 02:16:41,075
<i>  If I had known for just one second</i>

1961
02:16:41,076 --> 02:16:43,011
<i>  You'd be back to bother me</i>

1962
02:16:43,012 --> 02:16:47,249
<i>  Boy, now go, walk out the door</i>

1963
02:16:47,250 --> 02:16:51,720
<i>  Just turn around now 'cause
you're not welcome anymore</i>

1964
02:16:52,455 --> 02:16:55,289
<i>  Weren't you the one who
tried to hurt me with goodbye?</i>

1965
02:16:55,290 --> 02:16:57,592
<i>  Did you think I'd crumble?</i>

1966
02:16:57,593 --> 02:16:59,261
<i>  Did you think I'd lay down and die?</i>

1967
02:16:59,262 --> 02:17:03,531
<i>  Oh, no, not I I will survive</i>

1968
02:17:03,532 --> 02:17:06,135
<i>  For as long as I know how to love</i>

1969
02:17:06,136 --> 02:17:07,869
<i>  I know I'll stay alive</i>

1970
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:10,038
<i>  I've got all my life to live</i>

1971
02:17:10,039 --> 02:17:11,806
<i>  And I've got all my love to give</i>

1972
02:17:11,807 --> 02:17:13,674
<i>  And I'll survive</i>

1973
02:17:13,675 --> 02:17:15,743
<i>  I will survive</i>

1974
02:17:15,744 --> 02:17:17,679
<i>  Hey, hey</i>

1975
02:17:32,528 --> 02:17:36,531
<i>  Boy, now go, walk out the door</i>

1976
02:17:36,532 --> 02:17:41,937
<i>  Just turn around now 'cause
you're not welcome anymore</i>

1977
02:17:41,938 --> 02:17:44,872
<i>  Weren't you the one who
tried to break me with goodbye?</i>

1978
02:17:44,873 --> 02:17:47,074
<i>  Did you think I'd crumble?</i>

1979
02:17:47,075 --> 02:17:48,943
<i>  Did you think I'd lay down and die?</i>

1980
02:17:48,944 --> 02:17:53,181
<i>  Oh, no, not I I will survive</i>

1981
02:17:53,182 --> 02:17:55,683
<i>  For as long as I know how to love</i>

1982
02:17:55,684 --> 02:17:57,152
<i>  I know I'll stay alive</i>

1983
02:17:57,153 --> 02:17:59,455
<i>  I've got all my life to live</i>

1984
02:17:59,456 --> 02:18:01,190
<i>  And I've got all my love to give</i>

1985
02:18:01,191 --> 02:18:02,725

02:18:03,192 --> 02:18:05,150

(gunfire)

6
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:37,318
You're from Baker?

7
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,581
Tell Baker I told him all I know already.

8
00:10:50,665 --> 00:10:54,794
Tell him I want to live in peace,
that it's no use to go on tormenting me.

9
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:57,797
I know nothing about that case of coins.

10
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,260
Now that gold has disappeared, but if
he'd listened we could have avoided this.

11
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:06,972
I went to the army court.
There were no witnesses.

12
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:09,308
They couldn't uncover any more.

13
00:11:09,392 --> 00:11:12,269
I can't tell Baker
what happened to the money.

14
00:11:12,353 --> 00:11:15,815
Go back and tell him that.

15
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,611
Word's around you had a visitor.

16
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:23,322
And Baker knows it.

17
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:27,243
Name of Jackson.

18
00:11:29,912 --> 00:11:31,455
Well?

19
00:11:31,539 --> 00:11:33,999
Jackson was here.

20
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:38,587
Or Baker's got it all wrong.

21
00:11:45,386 --> 00:11:47,722
He's not wrong.

22
00:11:47,805 --> 00:11:52,560
Maybe Baker would like to know
just what you and Jackson had to say...

23
00:11:52,643 --> 00:11:55,771
about the cash box.

24
00:11:58,524 --> 00:12:01,694
That's not what I'm being paid for.

25
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:09,827
I'm only interested in what name
Jackson's hiding under now.

26
00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:15,166
Why do you think
Jackson is assuming another name?

27
00:12:15,249 --> 00:12:18,210
I would have found him already.

28
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:21,672
When I start off
to find somebody, I find 'em.

29
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:24,842
That's why they pay me.

30
00:12:29,305 --> 00:12:31,515
What is Baker paying you?

31
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,938
That your family?

32
00:12:46,113 --> 00:12:47,656
Yes.

33
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:51,243
Nice family.

34
00:12:52,536 --> 00:12:55,539
What does he pay you for murdering me?

35
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:02,296
500 dollars, to get the name.

36
00:13:08,552 --> 00:13:10,638
The name.

37
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:22,274
Carson... Bill Carson.

38
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,903
That's what he calls himself now.

39
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,811
It's a lot of money. One thousand.

40
00:14:02,773 --> 00:14:05,275
A thousand dollars?

41
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:11,281
And some in gold. It's a tidy sum.

42
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:17,287
But when I'm paid...

43
00:14:17,371 --> 00:14:20,499
I always see the job through.

44
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:24,688
(snoring)

45
00:15:32,237 --> 00:15:35,657
It's you. Any information?

46
00:15:37,951 --> 00:15:40,621
Too much.

47
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:43,665
He said quite a bit
that should interest you.

48
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:46,460
And one or two things that interested me.

49
00:15:46,543 --> 00:15:48,712
Such as?

50
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:52,716
The name Jackson's hiding under
is Bill Carson.

51
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:58,597
That's your bit.

52
00:15:59,848 --> 00:16:01,934
Keep talking.

53
00:16:02,017 --> 00:16:05,896
He also mentioned something
about a certain cash box

54
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:08,941
which just happened to disappear.

55
00:16:09,024 --> 00:16:10,943
That's my bit.

56
00:16:11,026 --> 00:16:13,153
Anything else?

57
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:15,489
Not enough for you, eh?

58
00:16:15,572 --> 00:16:19,660
Well, you don't have to worry.
He'll never say anything to anybody again.

59
00:16:20,244 --> 00:16:22,454
Oh, yeah. Perfect.

60
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:25,749
Here... Here you are.

61
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:29,294
Here, this is for you.
You did a good job for me.

62
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:31,880
Worth 500 dollars.

63
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:34,091
(coughs weakly)

64
00:16:34,174 --> 00:16:37,386
Yeah. I almost forgot.

65
00:16:37,469 --> 00:16:39,930
He gave me a thousand.

66
00:16:40,013 --> 00:16:43,183
I think his idea
was that I kill you. (chuckles)

67
00:16:49,773 --> 00:16:55,153
But you know, the pity is, when I'm paid
I always follow my job through.

68
00:16:55,237 --> 00:16:57,030
You know that.

69
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:59,908
No! Angel Eyes!

70
00:17:19,928 --> 00:17:21,763
(chuckles)

71
00:17:30,063 --> 00:17:32,315
(gun cocking)

72
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,204
No. No pistol, amigo.

73
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:50,459
It won't do you any good.
There are three of us.

74
00:18:04,639 --> 00:18:06,308
Hey, amigo...

75
00:18:06,391 --> 00:18:11,646
You know you got a face beautiful enough
to be worth 2,000 dollars?

76
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,523
(laughter)

77
00:18:13,607 --> 00:18:16,485
(new voice) Yeah...

78
00:18:16,568 --> 00:18:20,739
But you don't look like the one
who'll collect it.

79
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:29,915
A couple of steps back.

80
00:19:23,718 --> 00:19:25,804
Thank you.

81
00:19:34,562 --> 00:19:36,898
How much are you worth now?

82
00:19:36,982 --> 00:19:38,984
How much?

83
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,903
2,000 dollars.

84
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:46,074
That's right, 2,000 dollars.

85
00:19:46,157 --> 00:19:48,868
2,000 dollars. (chuckles)

86
00:19:54,499 --> 00:19:58,628
!Hijo de puta que te pari!
You'll pay for this!

87
00:19:58,712 --> 00:20:01,214
I hope you end up in a graveyard,

88
00:20:01,298 --> 00:20:04,301
with the cholera and the rabies
and the plague!

89
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:09,264
Cut me loose! Cut me loose,
you filthy bastard! Put me down!

90
00:20:09,347 --> 00:20:12,309
I hope your mother ends up
in a two-dollar whorehouse!

91
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:14,811
Cut me loose!

92
00:20:15,854 --> 00:20:20,817
You can still save yourself.
Let me go and I'll pardon you.

93
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,986
Let me go.

94
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:27,824
I feel sick.
The blood is rushing to my...

95
00:20:27,907 --> 00:20:32,829
I'm dry, Blondie.
Agua... Water...

96
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:36,624
(dirty laugh)

97
00:20:38,501 --> 00:20:40,128
You swine!

98
00:20:40,211 --> 00:20:43,673
You son of a bitch! Let me go!

99
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:47,302
You're brave with a man who's tied up.
Come back.

100
00:20:47,385 --> 00:20:50,138
Come back and fight.

101
00:20:50,221 --> 00:20:52,098
You bastard.

102
00:20:53,058 --> 00:20:56,936
Who the hell is that?
One bastard goes in, another comes out.

103
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:00,690
- Cut it out.
- I'm an honest farmer.

104
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:03,068
I'm innocent of everything.

105
00:21:04,861 --> 00:21:06,905
So you're an honest farmer?

106
00:21:06,988 --> 00:21:09,532
You recognise this man?

107
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:12,494
Yeah, it's you.

108
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:16,581
Me? Who says so?
You can't even read.

109
00:21:16,664 --> 00:21:20,960
Roll it up. I'll give you a good idea
where you can put it.

110
00:21:21,044 --> 00:21:24,589
To hell with all you sheriffs
and all who gave birth to you.

111
00:21:24,672 --> 00:21:28,092
Hey, everybody, look!
He's giving him the filthy money!

112
00:21:28,176 --> 00:21:33,556
Judas! You sold my hide. But you won't
enjoy that money, not a penny.

113
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,727
If there's justice in the world,
that money will go to the undertaker.

114
00:21:37,811 --> 00:21:39,687
You know who you are?

115
00:21:39,771 --> 00:21:42,148
Want to know whose son you are?

116
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:44,692
You don't. I do. Everybody does.

117
00:21:44,776 --> 00:21:48,321
You're the son of a thousand fathers,
all bastards like you.

118
00:21:48,404 --> 00:21:51,199
And your mother, she's...

119
00:21:51,282 --> 00:21:53,660
You bastard!

120
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:58,373
Your mother, it's better not to talk of her!
I never hurt anybody!

121
00:21:58,456 --> 00:22:04,546
Wanted in 1 4 counties of this state,

..to hang by the neck until dead.

May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

00:23:25,335 --> 00:23:27,378
Five for you.

00:23:27,462 --> 00:23:31,632
One, two, three, four... five for me.

137

Five for you and five for me.

138
00:23:38,264 --> 00:23:40,600
Know how much you're worth now?

139
00:23:40,683 --> 00:23:44,145
- No. How much?
- 3,000 dollars.

140
00:23:44,979 --> 00:23:47,065
(gratified grunt)

141
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:50,902
There are two kinds of people
in the world, my friend:

142
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:55,490
those with a rope around their neck
and the people who do the cutting.

143
00:23:55,573 --> 00:24:00,453
The neck at the end of the rope is mine.
I run the risks.

144
00:24:00,536 --> 00:24:04,248
So the next time I want more than half.

145
00:24:04,332 --> 00:24:08,961
You may run the risks, my friend,
but I do the cutting.

146
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:14,258
If we cut down my percentage...

147
00:24:14,342 --> 00:24:16,594
Cigar?

148
00:24:17,637 --> 00:24:20,056
..Iiable to interfere with my aim.

149
00:24:22,475 --> 00:24:26,187
But if you miss,
you had better miss very well.

150
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:30,274
Whoever double-crosses me
and leaves me alive,

151
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:34,320
he understands nothing about Tuco.

152
00:24:34,403 --> 00:24:36,489
Nothing.

153
00:24:39,617 --> 00:24:41,786
Wanted in 15 counties of this state,

154
00:24:41,869 --> 00:24:45,581
the condemned standing before us...
sitting before us,

155
00:24:45,665 --> 00:24:49,126
Tuco Benedicto Pacfico
Juan-Maria Ramirez,

156
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:53,214
has been found guilty by the circuit court
of the following crimes:

157
00:24:53,297 --> 00:24:58,302
murder, assaulting a justice of the peace,
raping a virgin of the white race,

158
00:24:58,386 --> 00:25:01,764
statutory rape of a minor
of the black race,

159
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:03,432
derailing a train...

160
00:25:03,516 --> 00:25:06,143
Hey, Angel Eyes.

161
00:25:12,024 --> 00:25:15,653
- What d'you find out, Shorty?
- If you ask me, it seems like a book.

162
00:25:15,736 --> 00:25:19,949
A unit escorting a cash box of gold coins
meets a Yankee ambush

163
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:24,954
and only three of 'em are saved -
Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.

164
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:27,582
What wasn't saved was the coins.

165
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:31,627
But the army holds a hearing,
and Jackson's acquitted.

166
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:34,547
He disappears and becomes Bill Carson.

167
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:38,801
- I know his name.
- But not who you're looking for. I do.

168
00:25:38,884 --> 00:25:43,681
And when he's found,
I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.

169
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:46,559
Where is Carson?

170
00:25:46,642 --> 00:25:49,854
All I know is Carson re-enlisted.
The poor guy's minus an eye.

171
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:54,275
He lives with a girl called Maria.
She's a fresh young whore in the territory.

172
00:25:54,358 --> 00:25:57,612
- Where is she?
- Now, what's the name of that town?

173
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:59,488
Someplace fairly near.

174
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:03,326
Santa Ana.

175
00:26:06,454 --> 00:26:09,582
Adios, half-soldier.

176
00:26:13,127 --> 00:26:15,212
Hey, Luke, hand me down a whiskey.

177
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:17,548
..and the sheriff's office in Sonora.

178
00:26:17,631 --> 00:26:20,718
He then hired himself out
as guide to a wagon train,

179
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:23,054
and, after receiving payment in advance,

180
00:26:23,137 --> 00:26:26,599
deserted the wagon train on
the hunting grounds of the Sioux Indians.

181
00:26:26,682 --> 00:26:30,519
I'm glad they got him.
A man guilty of all those crimes.

182
00:26:30,603 --> 00:26:35,191
- Convicted people don't always hang.
- What do you mean?

183
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:39,362
Even a filthy beggar like that
has got a protecting angel.

184
00:26:46,285 --> 00:26:50,206
A golden-haired angel watches over him.

185
00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:54,126
(judge) For all these crimes,
the accused has made a full confession.

186
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:57,755
Therefore, we condemn him
to be hung by the neck until dead.

187
00:26:57,838 --> 00:27:00,716
May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

188
00:27:16,232 --> 00:27:19,360
Let's get the hell out of here!

189
00:27:49,807 --> 00:27:52,685
What are you trying to say?
Anybody can miss a shot?

190
00:27:52,768 --> 00:27:54,812
Nobody misses
when I'm at the end of the rope.

191
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:58,274
You never had a rope round your neck.
Let me tell you something.

192
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:03,654
When that rope starts to pull tight,
you can feel the devil bite your ass.

193
00:28:05,573 --> 00:28:07,741
Yeah. You're right.

194
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:10,494
It's getting tougher.

195
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:17,167
The way I figure, there's really not too
much future with a sawn-off runt like you.

196
00:28:17,251 --> 00:28:18,544
What do you mean?

197
00:28:18,627 --> 00:28:22,548
I don't think you'll ever
be worth more than 3,000 dollars.

198
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:25,593
What do you mean?

199
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:28,512
I mean our partnership is untied.

200
00:28:29,597 --> 00:28:31,599
Oh, no, not you.

201
00:28:31,682 --> 00:28:33,475
You remain tied.

202
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,562
I'll keep the money
and you can have the rope.

203
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:40,774
You filthy, double-crossing bastard.
Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...

204
00:28:40,858 --> 00:28:43,861
The way back to town is only 70 miles.

205
00:28:44,945 --> 00:28:48,157
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

206
00:28:48,782 --> 00:28:49,992
Adios.

207
00:28:50,075 --> 00:28:53,287
You filthy bastard! Come here!

208
00:28:53,704 --> 00:28:58,751
Come here. Cut this rope off.
Get off that horse, you filthy coward.

209
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:02,087
If I ever catch you, Blondie,
I'll rip your heart out and eat it!

210
00:29:02,171 --> 00:29:07,176
I'll skin you alive! I'll hang you up
by your thumbs! You pig! You vulture!

211
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:09,803
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

212
00:29:09,887 --> 00:29:11,764
(tsks)

213
00:29:11,847 --> 00:29:16,226
Such ingratitude.
After all the times I've saved your life.

214
00:29:21,065 --> 00:29:23,901
Wait a minute.
This is only a trick.

215
00:29:23,984 --> 00:29:26,945
You wouldn't leave me here. Come back.

216
00:29:27,029 --> 00:29:30,866
Wait, Blondie! Listen...

217
00:29:30,949 --> 00:29:34,370
!Hijo de una gran puta!

218
00:29:34,453 --> 00:29:37,539
(echoes into theme music)

219
00:29:43,962 --> 00:29:46,924
(drunken singing)

220
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,098
(laughter)

221
00:29:55,057 --> 00:29:58,268
I believe madam is home.

222
00:29:58,352 --> 00:30:00,437
Sweet dreams.

223
00:30:11,323 --> 00:30:14,034
You filthy rats!

224
00:30:29,508 --> 00:30:31,969
(man, quietly) Maria?

225
00:30:38,058 --> 00:30:41,145
Is that you, Bill?

226
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:43,147
Bill!

227
00:30:44,314 --> 00:30:46,108
Arh!

228
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:54,158
Who are you?

229
00:30:54,241 --> 00:30:56,201
What do you want with me?

230
00:30:56,285 --> 00:30:59,621
Go on talking about Bill Carson.

231
00:30:59,705 --> 00:31:02,416
I don't know him.

232
00:31:02,499 --> 00:31:05,752
You were calling to him in the dark.

233
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,716
Where is he?

234
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,135
What are you gonna do to him?

235
00:31:14,511 --> 00:31:16,722
I'll ask the questions.

236
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:20,934
Where is he?

237
00:31:27,691 --> 00:31:29,568
Where is he? Where?

238
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:32,362
Where? Where?

239
00:31:32,446 --> 00:31:34,740
Where?

240
00:31:37,534 --> 00:31:39,620
That's enough.

241
00:31:40,871 --> 00:31:44,166
I don't know where he is.
He packed his things ten days ago

242
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:47,586
and went away with his unit. They all left.

243
00:31:47,669 --> 00:31:49,838
Which company? Where did they go?

244
00:31:52,591 --> 00:31:53,884
Hm?

245
00:31:53,967 --> 00:31:58,889
3rd Cavalry. General Sibley.
They left for Santa Fe.

246
00:31:59,973 --> 00:32:03,185
That's all I know. I swear.

247
00:32:56,738 --> 00:32:59,032
(pained gasp)

248
00:33:28,603 --> 00:33:30,689
But... but...

249
00:33:34,818 --> 00:33:37,529
I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.

250
00:33:37,612 --> 00:33:39,281
Mm-hm.

251
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,045
(chuckles)

252
00:34:15,817 --> 00:34:19,613
- Revolvers!
- Yeah, revolvers.

253
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:25,118
Revolvers.

254
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:29,456
Well, here's where I keep the best ones.

255
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:36,880
Here, Remington, Colt,

256
00:34:36,963 --> 00:34:39,758
a Root, Smith-Wesson,

257
00:34:39,841 --> 00:34:44,137
Colt - navy, Joslyn,

258
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,431
another Remington, and this one...

259
00:34:46,514 --> 00:34:47,974
That's enough.

260
00:35:31,309 --> 00:35:33,645
Cartridges.

261
00:35:41,444 --> 00:35:45,699
- You wanna try the pistol, step out back.
- Let's go.

262
00:35:50,745 --> 00:35:52,831
Move, move.

263
00:36:41,171 --> 00:36:43,715
(chuckles)

264
00:37:07,655 --> 00:37:09,741
Cartridge.

265
00:37:17,624 --> 00:37:20,752
- How much?
- Twenty dollars.

266
00:37:21,794 --> 00:37:24,839
(chuckles) No.

267
00:37:27,508 --> 00:37:30,595
Fifty dollars.

268
00:37:30,678 --> 00:37:35,141
- How much?
- A hundred dollars.

269
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:41,356
Two hundred dollars. It's all I've got.

270
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:43,524
Here.

271
00:38:02,502 --> 00:38:05,004
Come here.

272
00:38:11,094 --> 00:38:12,762
- Aaah..
- Ahh...

273
00:38:15,181 --> 00:38:18,518
- (chuckles) Heh?
- Mm-hm.

274
00:38:23,106 --> 00:38:28,319
(Tuco) If you work for a living,
why do you kill yourself working?

275
00:39:05,648 --> 00:39:11,946
If you work for a living,
why do you kill yourself working?

276
00:39:38,389 --> 00:39:40,475
Potatoes.

277
00:39:41,184 --> 00:39:44,479
You've gotta be poor to eat potatoes.

278
00:39:45,396 --> 00:39:47,523
Really poor.

279
00:39:47,607 --> 00:39:51,152
I'm rich. But I'm lonely.

280
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:56,282
The world is divided into two parts:

281
00:39:56,365 --> 00:40:02,371
those who have friends,
and those who are lonely, like poor Tuco.

282
00:40:03,998 --> 00:40:08,878
You see, I used to have a friend - Pedro.

283
00:40:09,795 --> 00:40:13,382
Chico and Ramn, his two brothers,
were my friends too.

284
00:40:16,844 --> 00:40:20,139
But who knows where they are now?

285
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:24,685
Ah, it's too bad, friends.
Tough luck I haven't found you.

286
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:27,063
I had a good deal for you.

287
00:40:29,315 --> 00:40:33,277
There's a big son of a bitch
who's got 4,000 dollars.

288
00:40:34,195 --> 00:40:39,700
4,000 dollars.
And I know where to find it.

289
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:47,500
If they would help me catch him,
I'd divide it four ways, like a brother.

290
00:40:48,084 --> 00:40:51,295
1 ,000 dollars each. Hm?

291
00:41:08,521 --> 00:41:11,607
You're alive, Tuco. Is it true?

292
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:16,946
And rich. Like you're going to be.

293
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:19,949
But people are saying
you got killed in Albuquerque.

294
00:41:20,032 --> 00:41:22,285
And people talk bullshit.

295
00:41:25,997 --> 00:41:29,333
I'm alive, you bastards,
and I always will be.

296
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:32,753
And I've come to give you 3,000 dollars.

297
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:34,922
Vamos.

298
00:41:51,105 --> 00:41:53,232
This morning I heard the whole thing.

299
00:41:53,315 --> 00:41:58,487
Canby's closing in with his northerners
and tomorrow they'll be in the city.

300
00:41:58,571 --> 00:42:01,282
That's why these southerners
are getting out.

301
00:42:01,365 --> 00:42:04,827
As soon as these cowards
hear of blue-shirts around, they run.

302
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,789
- These rebels have no will to fight.
- Poor things.

303
00:42:08,873 --> 00:42:14,170
They'll soon be finished. Then we begin
making money on those Yankees.

304
00:42:14,253 --> 00:42:16,630
They carry gold, not paper dollars.

305
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:19,592
And they're going to beat the South.

306
00:42:19,675 --> 00:42:24,889
Look. See that one with the white beard,
General Sibley? He looks dead.

307
00:42:24,972 --> 00:42:26,974
He's finally getting out of our hair.

308
00:42:27,057 --> 00:42:31,937
Hooray for Dixie!
Hooray, hooray for Dixie!

309
00:42:35,649 --> 00:42:38,736
Where's the owner of that horse?

310
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:41,989
- Please, mister... A bad heart...
- Where?

311
00:42:42,072 --> 00:42:47,077
- The war's frightened me already.
- I'm looking for the owner of that horse.

312
00:42:47,161 --> 00:42:52,249
He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar
and he's a pig. Where is he now?

313
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:55,211
He doesn't know who rides every horse.

314
00:42:55,294 --> 00:42:58,881
You stay quiet, old hen.

315
00:42:58,964 --> 00:43:03,135
Upstairs in room four, seor.

316
00:43:08,224 --> 00:43:10,518
Hear that?

317
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:19,151
You rotten criminals. How dare you?

318
00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:24,448
(rumble of wagons outside)

319
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:25,444
(chink of spurs)

320
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:33,660
(distant cannon fire)

321
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:35,389
Your spurs.

322
00:46:43,438 --> 00:46:45,524
(Tuco chuckles)

323
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:52,406
There are two kinds of spurs, my friend:

324
00:46:52,489 --> 00:46:57,953
those that come in by the door,
and those that come in by the window.

325
00:46:58,036 --> 00:47:01,164
Take off that pistol belt.

326
00:47:07,629 --> 00:47:09,089
It's empty.

327
00:47:11,717 --> 00:47:15,012
- Mine isn't.
- (closer cannon fire)

328
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:23,770
Even when Judas hanged himself,
there was a storm, too.

329
00:47:27,107 --> 00:47:29,484
That could be cannon fire.

330
00:47:29,568 --> 00:47:34,114
Cannon fire or storm,
it's all the same to you.

331
00:47:35,615 --> 00:47:39,536
You ever see this before, my friend?

332
00:47:47,502 --> 00:47:51,173
Throw it over the roof beam.

333
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:53,300
That's it.

334
00:48:04,978 --> 00:48:07,064
Now get on that.

335
00:48:16,907 --> 00:48:18,784
That's right.

336
00:48:18,867 --> 00:48:21,369
Now make sure the rope is tight.

337
00:48:21,453 --> 00:48:24,581
It's got to hold the weight of a pig.

338
00:48:30,879 --> 00:48:34,382
Now put the rope around your neck.

339
00:48:40,222 --> 00:48:43,058
That's very good.

340
00:48:43,141 --> 00:48:46,978
It's too big for your neck, huh?
We fix that right away.

341
00:48:47,062 --> 00:48:51,316
I have another system.
A little different than yours.

342
00:48:52,234 --> 00:48:56,446
I don't shoot the rope,
I shoot the legs off the stool.

343
00:49:00,992 --> 00:49:03,078
Adis.

344
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,227
Welcome, my friend.

345
00:52:14,310 --> 00:52:17,814
If you're looking for a summer
vacation spot, you've found it.

346
00:52:17,897 --> 00:52:21,401
Our hotel is luxurious
and filled with conveniences.

347
00:52:21,484 --> 00:52:23,361
(laughter)

348
00:52:23,444 --> 00:52:25,572
And the attractions don't stop there.

349
00:52:25,655 --> 00:52:29,868
International cuisine,
healthful and nutritious food.

350
00:52:29,951 --> 00:52:32,036
Corn cobs, Dixie-style.

351
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,622
Our government has spared no expense.

352
00:52:34,706 --> 00:52:37,584
As you can see, we are treated very well.

353
00:52:37,667 --> 00:52:41,254
Have you ever heard of anyone
by the name of Bill Carson?

354
00:52:41,337 --> 00:52:46,509
And you? Have you ever heard
of someone named Canby? No?

355
00:52:46,593 --> 00:52:50,930
Well, you see, he's a Yankee colonel
who decided to tear us to pieces.

356
00:52:51,014 --> 00:52:54,100
The only thing we care about
is saving our own hides.

357
00:52:54,183 --> 00:52:57,103
And you ask me if I know someone.

358
00:52:57,186 --> 00:53:01,357
I just don't know what you drifters
could be thinking.

359
00:53:12,118 --> 00:53:16,289
Carson has a patch over one eye.
He's with the 3rd.

360
00:53:18,041 --> 00:53:22,086
If he's with the 3rd...
They've already left.

361
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,796
For Glorietta.

362
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,092
Canby's front line is right on their heels.
Those poor young devils.

363
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:34,098
And the desert lies ahead of 'em. I really
doubt that any of them are still alive.

364
00:53:34,182 --> 00:53:36,726
And what if they were still alive?

365
00:53:39,062 --> 00:53:41,314
Worse.

366
00:53:41,397 --> 00:53:45,068
Well, then, you must not have
heard anything about Batterville.

367
00:53:45,151 --> 00:53:51,032
It's one of those Yankee prison camps
you'd better hope you never end up in.

368
00:53:51,115 --> 00:53:53,618
Keep it. It's yours.

369
00:56:18,387 --> 00:56:22,433
We have found the accused,
Thomas Larson, alias Shorty Larson,

370
00:56:22,516 --> 00:56:25,102
guilty of the following crimes:

371
00:56:25,186 --> 00:56:29,774
horse-theft, theft of supplies
belonging to the Union army...

372
00:56:44,205 --> 00:56:46,040
And Shorty?

373
00:56:50,795 --> 00:56:51,962
No.

374
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:55,800
No?

375
00:56:56,092 --> 00:56:59,845
..alias Shorty Larson,
to hang by the neck until dead.

376
00:56:59,929 --> 00:57:03,224
May God have mercy on his soul.
Proceed.

377
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,399
Sorry, Shorty.

378
00:57:12,817 --> 00:57:15,528
Move. Come on, let's go.

379
00:57:40,136 --> 00:57:43,180
I don't know...
As soon as I hit the desert, I'm thirsty.

380
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:49,145
It burns, huh? They say people
with fair skin can't take too much.

381
00:58:12,501 --> 00:58:16,338
Like that,
you won't have to carry so much.

382
00:58:17,339 --> 00:58:19,717
Where are we going?

383
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,302
Where?

384
00:58:21,385 --> 00:58:23,846
Where I'm going, amigo.

385
00:58:23,929 --> 00:58:25,723
Over that way.

386
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:29,643
Another 100 miles
of beautiful sun-baked sand.

387
00:58:29,727 --> 00:58:32,396
Even the armies are afraid
to march through there.

388
00:58:32,479 --> 00:58:35,065
Sibley's men are retreating up there.

389
00:58:35,149 --> 00:58:38,319
Canby's men are coming here.

390
00:58:38,402 --> 00:58:42,364
But no-one will set foot in this hell.

391
00:58:42,448 --> 00:58:45,159
Except you and me.

392
00:58:46,327 --> 00:58:49,705
100 miles. That's a nice walk.

393
00:58:52,249 --> 00:58:55,711
What was it you told me the last time?

394
00:58:56,962 --> 00:59:01,759
If you save your breath,
I feel a man like you could manage it.

395
00:59:02,927 --> 00:59:07,389
And if you won't manage it,
you'll die - only slowly.

396
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:12,102
Very slowly, old friend.

397
00:59:16,148 --> 00:59:17,942
After you, please.

398
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:20,110
Start walking.

399
01:01:04,423 --> 01:01:06,508
(Tuco laughs)

400
01:01:15,684 --> 01:01:18,020
Taking a rest?

401
01:01:18,479 --> 01:01:22,858
Come on, Blondie. We don't have
very far to go. Only 70 miles.

402
01:01:24,109 --> 01:01:27,905
Only eight and a half hours more
before sunset.

403
01:01:27,988 --> 01:01:30,532
That's not too bad.

404
01:01:31,575 --> 01:01:32,910
Come on.

405
01:02:09,988 --> 01:02:12,491
(chuckles heartily)

406
01:02:16,912 --> 01:02:18,789
Whoa...

407
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,022
OK, let's eat.

408
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:29,860
That is, I'll eat.

409
01:03:31,611 --> 01:03:35,866
Meanwhile, you can enjoy a sunbath.

410
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:46,334
You want some water?

411
01:03:50,088 --> 01:03:51,840
Drink.

412
01:03:57,846 --> 01:04:00,056
Come on.

413
01:04:41,056 --> 01:04:44,434
Well, Blondie... So long.

414
01:05:51,209 --> 01:05:54,129
And so, Blondie...

415
01:05:55,755 --> 01:05:58,258
it's goodbye.

416
01:05:58,341 --> 01:06:01,261
(rumble of hooves)

417
01:06:54,105 --> 01:06:56,357
Whoa, whoa...

418
01:07:01,154 --> 01:07:02,781
Easy, easy.

419
01:07:02,864 --> 01:07:05,617
Easy. Attaboy.

420
01:09:23,546 --> 01:09:25,882
(creaking)

421
01:09:34,599 --> 01:09:36,684
Water...

422
01:09:44,025 --> 01:09:49,030
200,000 in gold.
It's yours, just get me water.

423
01:09:52,867 --> 01:09:54,911
What's that you say?

424
01:09:54,994 --> 01:09:58,748
- Who the hell are you?
- Carson.

425
01:09:58,831 --> 01:10:02,251
My name is Bill Carson now.

426
01:10:02,335 --> 01:10:05,088
Surprise attack...

427
01:10:05,171 --> 01:10:09,717
AII dead...
My name is Jackson, not Carson...

428
01:10:09,801 --> 01:10:13,221
Carson, yeah. Glad to meet you.
I'm Lincoln's grandfather.

429
01:10:13,304 --> 01:10:19,018
- What's that you said about the dollars?
- 200,000, all mine.

430
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:22,104
It was the 3rd Cavalry's.

431
01:10:22,188 --> 01:10:25,066
Baker has nothing.

432
01:10:25,149 --> 01:10:28,945
The gold... I hid the gold.
The gold is safe.

433
01:10:30,154 --> 01:10:33,074
Where? Here?

434
01:10:33,157 --> 01:10:37,245
- Talk.
- In... the... cemetery.

435
01:10:37,328 --> 01:10:39,038
Which cemetery?

436
01:10:39,121 --> 01:10:42,792
The one on Sad Hill.

437
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:45,127
There's a grave...

438
01:10:45,211 --> 01:10:48,256
Which grave? Have a name?

439
01:10:48,339 --> 01:10:53,135
Have a number?
Come on, you dummy, talk.

440
01:10:53,219 --> 01:10:56,264
There's... no number.

441
01:10:56,347 --> 01:10:58,891
There's a name.

442
01:10:58,975 --> 01:11:01,477
It's written...

443
01:11:03,563 --> 01:11:05,648
(croaks)

444
01:11:07,858 --> 01:11:10,778
- Water...
- (frustrated grunt)

445
01:11:11,821 --> 01:11:14,699
You talk first. I'll give you water later.

446
01:11:14,782 --> 01:11:17,910
Sad Hill cemetery. OK.
In the grave. OK.

447
01:11:17,994 --> 01:11:24,083
But it must have a name or a number.
There must be 1 ,000... 5,000...

448
01:11:27,587 --> 01:11:31,632
Don't die, uh? Don't die.
I'll get you water.

449
01:11:31,716 --> 01:11:35,428
Stay there. Don't move.
I'll get you water.

450
01:11:35,511 --> 01:11:38,472
Don't die until later, you son of a...

451
01:11:59,035 --> 01:12:01,495
(yells)

452
01:12:03,539 --> 01:12:06,667
Get away from there.

453
01:12:11,213 --> 01:12:13,382
He's dead.

454
01:12:16,677 --> 01:12:19,180
I'll kill you.

455
01:12:21,140 --> 01:12:25,061
If you do that, you'll always be poor.

456
01:12:25,144 --> 01:12:28,272
Just like the greasy rat that you are.

457
01:12:28,814 --> 01:12:33,069
If I were you, I'd... keep me alive.

458
01:12:33,152 --> 01:12:36,280
What did he tell you?

459
01:12:36,364 --> 01:12:38,741
A name.

460
01:12:38,824 --> 01:12:43,120
- The name on a grave.
- What name?

461
01:12:56,509 --> 01:12:58,594
Blondie... Don't die.

462
01:12:58,677 --> 01:13:00,763
Blondie, don't die.

463
01:13:00,846 --> 01:13:03,557
I'm your friend. Please don't die.

464
01:13:03,641 --> 01:13:06,185
I'm your friend. Come on.

465
01:13:06,268 --> 01:13:07,853
Come on, eh?

466
01:13:07,937 --> 01:13:11,398
Blondie, I'll help you. I'll help you.

467
01:13:11,482 --> 01:13:14,443
Don't move. I'll be right back.
I'll get the water.

468
01:13:14,527 --> 01:13:18,405
Don't die like that pig.

469
01:13:18,489 --> 01:13:20,574
Here's water, Blondie.

470
01:13:20,658 --> 01:13:24,286
Don't drink, it's no good for you.
Feel better?

471
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:28,582
Blondie, what's the matter?
Please don't die.

472
01:13:36,882 --> 01:13:40,302
(Tuco) Hey, open up! Hurry!

473
01:13:40,386 --> 01:13:43,514
Settle down. Who's there?

474
01:13:44,849 --> 01:13:49,228
What do you mean, "who's there?"
You think I'm the enemy?

475
01:13:51,438 --> 01:13:55,401
If I were a Yankee,
you wouldn't have time to ask me that.

476
01:13:55,484 --> 01:13:56,735
Come on.

477
01:13:56,819 --> 01:14:00,364
Sergeant, listen to
this corporal for a moment.

478
01:14:00,447 --> 01:14:06,287
Sergeant, I have a gravely wounded man
here, if he's not dead already.

479
01:14:07,705 --> 01:14:11,750
- He's still alive?
- Well, he seems to be.

480
01:14:11,834 --> 01:14:13,878
- What happened?
- It was a trap.

481
01:14:13,961 --> 01:14:18,799
- Only the two of us got away.
- Name and travelling papers.

482
01:14:19,925 --> 01:14:23,971
Here. Corporal Bill Carson.
3rd Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron,

483
01:14:24,054 --> 01:14:27,766
arriving from San Rafael.
Is that enough?

484
01:14:32,396 --> 01:14:34,857
Are you reading when this man is dying?

485
01:14:34,940 --> 01:14:38,736
Why, Corporal, we're trying to withdraw
and you're looking for an infirmary?

486
01:14:38,819 --> 01:14:42,948
If you want one, you'll have
to make yourself a Yankee prisoner.

487
01:14:43,616 --> 01:14:47,202
- So where are we?
- Near Apache Canyon.

488
01:14:48,537 --> 01:14:50,998
Apache Canyon?

489
01:14:51,081 --> 01:14:53,584
Is a mission San Antonio around here?

490
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:55,836
18 miles south. Take him there.

491
01:14:55,919 --> 01:14:59,590
The brothers take care of any wounded,
whatever the colour of his uniform.

492
01:14:59,673 --> 01:15:02,676
And keep your eyes open -
the area is full of Yankees.

493
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,345
Thank you.
Goodbye, Sergeant.

494
01:15:04,428 --> 01:15:06,430
Take care.

495
01:15:25,115 --> 01:15:27,201
Whoa!

496
01:15:30,245 --> 01:15:33,499
- Got a very sick man here.
- But we have no more beds.

497
01:15:33,582 --> 01:15:36,085
Let him have yours.

498
01:15:41,006 --> 01:15:45,135
- Where's Padre Ramirez?
- Father Ramirez is away at the moment.

499
01:15:45,219 --> 01:15:47,638
He should be back any day now.

500
01:15:47,721 --> 01:15:51,892
It doesn't matter. For the moment,
we take very good care of my friend.

501
01:15:51,975 --> 01:15:53,811
And may God be praised.

502
01:15:53,894 --> 01:15:59,483
God is on our side too, because
he hates the Yankees. Huh, Blondie?

503
01:16:00,859 --> 01:16:04,822
- Father, is he still breathing?
- Yes, of course.

504
01:16:04,905 --> 01:16:06,990
You're heavy.

505
01:16:17,793 --> 01:16:19,878
There.

506
01:16:48,615 --> 01:16:51,743
AII right. Put a fresh bandage on him.

507
01:16:52,703 --> 01:16:55,497
Put him in my cell.

508
01:16:55,581 --> 01:16:57,666
Easy.

509
01:17:00,043 --> 01:17:02,379
Out, soldier. Out you go.

510
01:17:02,462 --> 01:17:06,300
Look after him, please.
He's like a brother to me.

511
01:17:10,929 --> 01:17:12,931
Hey, Father, l...

512
01:17:20,397 --> 01:17:22,566
(mutters)

513
01:17:25,694 --> 01:17:29,448
Father, did he speak?
Did he say anything?

514
01:17:58,352 --> 01:18:01,313
Father, did he ask for me?
Did he speak about anything?

515
01:18:01,396 --> 01:18:03,148
No, he hasn't spoken as yet.

516
01:18:03,231 --> 01:18:08,445
But don't worry, he's young and strong -
that's what's kept him going.

517
01:18:08,528 --> 01:18:10,864
He should regain his strength
in a short time.

518
01:18:10,947 --> 01:18:13,659
Thank you. You don't know
what this boy's life means to me.

519
01:18:13,742 --> 01:18:16,370
Thanks be to Jesus.

520
01:19:05,168 --> 01:19:06,461
Blondie?

521
01:19:12,008 --> 01:19:15,137
Hey, Blondie?

522
01:19:33,321 --> 01:19:37,701
The old Father tells me
you'll be up and around in a few days.

523
01:19:37,784 --> 01:19:41,621
You were very lucky to have me
so close when it happened.

524
01:19:41,705 --> 01:19:45,292
Think if you'd been on your own.

525
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:50,755
Look, I mean when one is... ill,

526
01:19:50,839 --> 01:19:56,052
it's good to have somebody close by,
friends or relations.

527
01:19:56,136 --> 01:20:01,808
Do you... you have parents, Blondie?
A mother?

528
01:20:02,350 --> 01:20:04,811
Not even a mother.

529
01:20:05,353 --> 01:20:07,439
No-one?

530
01:20:07,522 --> 01:20:10,984
You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.

531
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:13,820
We're all alone in the world.

532
01:20:13,904 --> 01:20:17,032
I have you, you have me.

533
01:20:18,742 --> 01:20:21,244
Only for a little while, I mean.

534
01:20:21,328 --> 01:20:26,583
It had to happen now.
What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.

535
01:20:26,666 --> 01:20:30,712
We could have all that money
in our hands.

536
01:20:34,799 --> 01:20:41,306
I... I must tell you the truth, Blondie.
In my place, you would do the same thing.

537
01:20:42,974 --> 01:20:46,186
It's all over for you now.

538
01:20:46,269 --> 01:20:50,148
There's nothing anyone can do any more.

539
01:20:51,566 --> 01:20:53,526
Oh, God, forgive me.

540
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:56,738
It's my fault, mine, mine, mine, mine!

541
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:09,876
I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.

542
01:21:09,959 --> 01:21:13,588
If I knew that my last hour had come,
I swear,

543
01:21:13,672 --> 01:21:17,926
in my place...
in your place I would do the same thing.

544
01:21:18,009 --> 01:21:21,554
I would tell about the gold.
Yes, yes, I would.

545
01:21:21,638 --> 01:21:23,973
I would tell the name on the grave.

546
01:21:24,057 --> 01:21:28,645
What good is the money if you're dead?
I know the name of the cemetery.

547
01:21:28,728 --> 01:21:31,940
But you know how many graves
there are there?

548
01:21:32,023 --> 01:21:37,904
Please. Blondie, please.
Have a little...

549
01:21:40,865 --> 01:21:44,244
Coffee?
Please, tell me the name.

550
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:46,913
On... on the grave.

551
01:21:48,289 --> 01:21:52,752
If I get my hands on the 200,000 dollars,

552
01:21:52,836 --> 01:21:55,839
I'll always honour your memory.

553
01:21:55,922 --> 01:22:00,218
I swear, I'll always honour your memory.

554
01:22:02,178 --> 01:22:04,139
Come closer.

555
01:22:09,018 --> 01:22:11,104
Tell me.

556
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,941
You dirty...

557
01:22:16,651 --> 01:22:19,237
I'll sleep better...

558
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:23,783
knowing my good friend is by my side...

559
01:22:23,867 --> 01:22:26,244
to protect me.

560
01:22:35,003 --> 01:22:37,338
"Tuco, water." Well, here's water.

561
01:22:37,422 --> 01:22:42,093
But if I get that name from you,
I'll give you water! I'll give you...

562
01:22:48,141 --> 01:22:50,977
AII right, you dirty skunk,
get your ass off the bed.

563
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:54,856
Come on. The party's over.
The wagon is all ready to go.

564
01:22:54,939 --> 01:23:00,320
We'd better get the hell out of here,
before we get caught up in the war.

565
01:23:00,403 --> 01:23:03,448
Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.

566
01:23:03,531 --> 01:23:08,411
This is something I have to look into.
It'll only take a minute. Get moving.

567
01:23:08,494 --> 01:23:11,080
- Where? This way?
- Yes.

568
01:23:27,680 --> 01:23:29,974
Hey, Pablo?

569
01:23:36,648 --> 01:23:39,275
Don't you recognise me?

570
01:23:40,818 --> 01:23:43,321
It's me. Tuco.

571
01:23:43,404 --> 01:23:46,532
Let me embrace you...

572
01:23:48,534 --> 01:23:51,746
I don't know the right thing.

573
01:23:55,917 --> 01:24:02,173
I was passing by and said to myself
"I wonder if my brother remembers me?"

574
01:24:04,717 --> 01:24:07,053
Did I do wrong?

575
01:24:07,553 --> 01:24:10,056
It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.

576
01:24:10,139 --> 01:24:12,392
You have seen me, Tuco.

577
01:24:14,310 --> 01:24:17,271
Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.

578
01:24:22,860 --> 01:24:24,946
Ah, my uniform.

579
01:24:25,029 --> 01:24:27,115
It's a long story.

580
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:30,618
But let's talk about you.
It's more important.

581
01:24:30,702 --> 01:24:35,373
You look very well.
A bit thin, perhaps, but...

582
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:40,837
You were always thin, eh, Pablito?

583
01:24:41,754 --> 01:24:44,799
Wh... What about our parents?

584
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:52,140
Only now do you think of them.
To begin after nine years.

585
01:24:54,058 --> 01:24:56,936
Nine years?

586
01:24:57,019 --> 01:24:59,731
So it's nine years.

587
01:24:59,814 --> 01:25:01,399
Nine years.

588
01:25:02,066 --> 01:25:04,902
Our mother has been dead
a long time now.

589
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:11,868
Our father died only a few days ago.
That's why I was away.

590
01:25:13,411 --> 01:25:15,913
He asked for you to be there.

591
01:25:15,997 --> 01:25:19,125
But there was only me.

592
01:25:25,006 --> 01:25:27,175
And you?

593
01:25:27,258 --> 01:25:31,471
Outside of evil,
what else have you managed to do?

594
01:25:31,554 --> 01:25:36,392
It seems to me
you once had a wife someplace.

595
01:25:37,810 --> 01:25:39,729
Not one. Lots of them.

596
01:25:39,812 --> 01:25:43,608
One here, one there,
wherever I found them.

597
01:25:43,691 --> 01:25:48,112
Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.

598
01:25:48,196 --> 01:25:51,532
What good would that be?

599
01:25:51,616 --> 01:25:54,285
Just keep on the way you're going.

600
01:25:54,368 --> 01:25:56,787
Go away.

601
01:25:56,871 --> 01:25:59,457
- The Lord have mercy on your soul.
- Sure, I'll go.

602
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:02,335
While I'm waiting
for the Lord to remember me!

603
01:26:02,418 --> 01:26:07,715
I, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother
Ramirez, will tell you something.

604
01:26:07,798 --> 01:26:10,218
You think you're better than I am.

605
01:26:10,301 --> 01:26:15,223
Where we came from,
one became a priest or a bandit.

606
01:26:15,306 --> 01:26:19,685
You chose your way, I chose mine.
Mine was harder.

607
01:26:19,769 --> 01:26:22,063
You talk of our mother and father -

608
01:26:22,146 --> 01:26:24,815
when you left to become a priest,
I stayed behind.

609
01:26:24,899 --> 01:26:29,028
I must have been 10, 12,
I don't remember. But I stayed.

610
01:26:29,111 --> 01:26:33,241
I tried, but it was no good.
Now I'll tell you something.

611
01:26:33,324 --> 01:26:39,330
You became a priest because you were
too much of a coward to do what I do.

612
01:26:56,764 --> 01:26:58,432
Tuco.

613
01:27:08,943 --> 01:27:11,195
Please forgive me, brother.

614
01:27:22,456 --> 01:27:24,375
Haa!

615
01:27:40,224 --> 01:27:44,145
Ah, my belly's full.

616
01:27:44,228 --> 01:27:46,480
Nice guy, my brother.

617
01:27:46,564 --> 01:27:49,108
I didn't tell you
my brother was in charge here?

618
01:27:49,191 --> 01:27:53,571
Everything. Like the Pope, almost.
He's in charge in Rome.

619
01:27:53,654 --> 01:27:58,909
My brother, he say to me
"Stay, brother, we never see each other."

620
01:27:58,993 --> 01:28:02,913
"There's plenty to eat and drink.
Bring your friend too."

621
01:28:02,997 --> 01:28:07,168
Whenever we see each other,
he never lets me go.

622
01:28:08,210 --> 01:28:11,338
My brother, he's crazy about me.

623
01:28:14,842 --> 01:28:19,930
That's so. Even a tramp like me,
no matter what happens,

624
01:28:20,014 --> 01:28:25,102
I know there's a brother somewhere
who'll never refuse me a bowl of soup.

625
01:28:26,645 --> 01:28:29,315
Sure.

626
01:28:29,398 --> 01:28:34,195
Well, after a meal
there's nothing like a good cigar.

627
01:29:23,994 --> 01:29:27,164
Here's the Sierra Magdalena.

628
01:29:27,248 --> 01:29:30,459
Going this way, we cross the Rio Grande.

629
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:33,587
That sure is a long way.

630
01:29:33,671 --> 01:29:37,800
Here to the northwest,
through all of Texas...

631
01:29:37,883 --> 01:29:40,052
- After that...
- Then what?

632
01:29:42,137 --> 01:29:46,934
When we get there, I'll tell you.
You're not worried, are you?

633
01:29:48,978 --> 01:29:53,357
Those men aren't worried
about anything any more, are they?

634
01:29:55,192 --> 01:30:01,448
But since I'm alive and I've noticed
we'll be crossing enemy lines a few times,

635
01:30:01,532 --> 01:30:04,785
I thought you might tell me
where we're going.

636
01:30:04,868 --> 01:30:08,956
Towards 200,000 dollars.
Is that good enough for you?

637
01:30:17,798 --> 01:30:19,883
Whoa.

638
01:30:20,551 --> 01:30:22,720
(growls)

639
01:30:28,350 --> 01:30:30,227
Wake up, you.

640
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:33,772
- There are troops coming.
- Blue or grey?

641
01:30:40,195 --> 01:30:43,907
They're grey, like us.
Let's say hello to them, then get going.

642
01:30:43,991 --> 01:30:47,870
Hurrah! Hurrah for the Confederacy!

643
01:30:47,953 --> 01:30:51,331
Hurrah! Down with General Grant!

644
01:30:51,415 --> 01:30:53,250
Hurrah for General...

645
01:30:53,333 --> 01:30:55,044
- What's his name?
- Lee.

646
01:30:55,127 --> 01:30:56,628
..Lee!

647
01:30:57,004 --> 01:31:02,092
God is with us because
he hates the Yanks, too! Hurrah!

648
01:31:02,176 --> 01:31:05,929
God's not on our side,
cos he hates idiots also.

649
01:31:18,192 --> 01:31:22,279
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

650
01:31:22,362 --> 01:31:26,074
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three four...

651
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:29,411
Prisoners of war, forward...

652
01:31:30,537 --> 01:31:32,289
march.

653
01:31:32,372 --> 01:31:35,542
Hup, two, three, four...

654
01:32:28,679 --> 01:32:31,348
Left face.

655
01:32:34,184 --> 01:32:38,730
Form a single file. Move.

656
01:33:08,844 --> 01:33:12,055
(corporal takes prisoner roll call)

657
01:33:19,604 --> 01:33:22,983
- Jonathan Broad.
- Present.

658
01:33:29,114 --> 01:33:31,825
- Richard Mobiley.
- Present.

659
01:33:31,908 --> 01:33:35,829
- Nathaniel Sullivan.
- Present.

660
01:33:36,288 --> 01:33:39,416
- Robert Clark.
- Present.

661
01:33:40,042 --> 01:33:42,919
- Sam Richmond.
- Present.

662
01:33:46,089 --> 01:33:48,175
Bill Carson.

663
01:33:50,886 --> 01:33:53,388
Bill Carson?

664
01:33:53,847 --> 01:33:56,308
I said Bill Carson.

665
01:33:56,391 --> 01:33:59,186
Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?

666
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:06,068
AII right, what's he doing, sleeping?
Bill Carson!

667
01:34:06,151 --> 01:34:09,029
Yeah. You better be Bill Carson.

668
01:34:09,112 --> 01:34:10,781
Bill Carson!

669
01:34:10,864 --> 01:34:13,992
Yeah, yeah... That's me.

670
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,211
Please, Carson...

671
01:34:25,253 --> 01:34:27,339
answer "present".

672
01:34:28,715 --> 01:34:31,510
What, are you deaf?

673
01:34:36,389 --> 01:34:38,892
Now suppose you say "present", Carson.

674
01:34:40,936 --> 01:34:46,024
I like big fat men like you -
when they fall, they make more noise.

675
01:34:46,107 --> 01:34:49,194
And sometimes they never get up.

676
01:34:49,986 --> 01:34:51,446
Wallace.

677
01:34:52,948 --> 01:34:54,699
That's enough.

678
01:34:57,577 --> 01:34:58,829
Sergeant.

679
01:35:00,956 --> 01:35:05,126
The captain wants to see you right away.

680
01:35:06,878 --> 01:35:10,423
Be sure these two get good treatment.

681
01:35:19,432 --> 01:35:23,395
Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
Good treatment.

682
01:35:25,689 --> 01:35:27,774
Yeah.

683
01:35:30,235 --> 01:35:33,780
For the last time, Sergeant,
I'm telling you,

684
01:35:33,863 --> 01:35:37,784
I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.

685
01:35:37,867 --> 01:35:40,829
No more brutality.

686
01:35:40,912 --> 01:35:44,624
There's hundreds of prisoners
and only a few men to guard 'em.

687
01:35:44,708 --> 01:35:46,793
I have to have respect.

688
01:35:46,876 --> 01:35:51,881
I think you'll manage to gain their respect
by treating them better.

689
01:35:53,174 --> 01:35:55,760
Are our men treated that well
in Andersonville camp?

690
01:35:55,844 --> 01:35:58,722
I don't give a goddamn
what they do in Andersonville.

691
01:35:58,805 --> 01:36:05,478
While I'm in charge, the prisoners are not
to be tortured or cheated... or murdered.

692
01:36:06,187 --> 01:36:07,981
That an accusation?

693
01:36:08,064 --> 01:36:13,278
Sergeant, gangrene is eating
my leg away, not my eyes.

694
01:36:13,778 --> 01:36:17,282
I know the prisoners here
are being robbed systematically.

695
01:36:17,365 --> 01:36:20,535
I know there's scum around,
bivouacked near the camp,

696
01:36:20,618 --> 01:36:23,830
waiting for someone to deliver this loot.

697
01:36:23,913 --> 01:36:28,918
But as long as I'm commandant, I won't
permit any such trickery. Am I clear?

698
01:36:31,212 --> 01:36:32,756
Yes, sir.

699
01:36:32,839 --> 01:36:35,216
Just as long as you're the commandant.

700
01:36:36,885 --> 01:36:38,970
Yes, Sergeant.

701
01:36:41,097 --> 01:36:44,851
I know this leg means
I won't last very long,

702
01:36:44,934 --> 01:36:51,608
but I pray I have enough time to amass
evidence and bring to a court martial

703
01:36:51,691 --> 01:36:57,739
all those who discredit and dishonour
the uniform of the Union.

704
01:37:01,993 --> 01:37:04,704
I wish you luck.

705
01:37:38,404 --> 01:37:42,742
You and the others
better lay low for a few days.

706
01:37:42,826 --> 01:37:47,080
I'll keep this. You go.
Wallace will let you know.

707
01:37:56,923 --> 01:38:01,469
- Wallace, bring me Carson.
- Right.

708
01:38:14,941 --> 01:38:19,028
Angel Eyes said for us
to lay low for a few days.

709
01:38:19,112 --> 01:38:24,409
We'll keep close enough to keep
an eye on things. Saddle your horses.

710
01:38:24,909 --> 01:38:26,995
Get in.

711
01:38:30,582 --> 01:38:32,750
(door is locked)

712
01:38:35,044 --> 01:38:38,256
Come on in, Tuco. Don't be bashful.

713
01:38:39,549 --> 01:38:42,677
There's no formalities here.

714
01:38:53,104 --> 01:38:55,732
It's been a long time.

715
01:38:55,815 --> 01:38:58,651
(Tuco's stomach rumbles)

716
01:38:58,735 --> 01:39:00,945
You're hungry.

717
01:39:01,029 --> 01:39:03,740
Sit down. Eat.

718
01:39:22,175 --> 01:39:25,637
I knew it, I knew it!

719
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:31,851
The minute I saw you, I said to myself
"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes."

720
01:39:32,852 --> 01:39:36,314
"I bet he got himself an easy job."

721
01:39:38,733 --> 01:39:41,444
"And he never forgets a friend."

722
01:39:41,527 --> 01:39:44,655
I never forget old friends, Tuco.

723
01:39:46,074 --> 01:39:47,658
Right.

724
01:39:47,742 --> 01:39:51,079
It's good to see old friends again.

725
01:39:51,162 --> 01:39:52,705
Good.

726
01:39:52,789 --> 01:39:56,209
Especially when they've come
from so far away.

727
01:39:56,292 --> 01:39:59,837
And have so much to talk about.

728
01:39:59,921 --> 01:40:03,299
And you do have a lot to talk about,
haven't you?

729
01:40:05,593 --> 01:40:09,389
You were captured near Fort Craig?

730
01:40:13,559 --> 01:40:20,066
If you were with Sibley, that means
you were coming from Santa Fe.

731
01:40:31,452 --> 01:40:36,999
- Was it hard crossing the desert?
- Mm-hm. Very hard.

732
01:40:37,083 --> 01:40:40,294
Especially if you don't have
anything to drink.

733
01:40:42,380 --> 01:40:48,219
Why are you going under
the name of Bill Carson now?

734
01:40:50,930 --> 01:40:53,683
One name is as good as another.

735
01:40:53,766 --> 01:40:56,686
Not wise to use your own name.

736
01:40:56,769 --> 01:41:01,149
Like you.
I bet they don't call you Angel Eyes.

737
01:41:01,232 --> 01:41:04,193
Sergeant Angel Eyes!

738
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:15,246
Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?

739
01:41:15,329 --> 01:41:21,335
Music? Yes, it's very good.
Very good for the digestion.

740
01:41:33,097 --> 01:41:35,391
So...

741
01:41:35,474 --> 01:41:39,520
Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?

742
01:41:43,482 --> 01:41:46,819
That fake, too?

743
01:41:46,903 --> 01:41:51,115
Bill Carson's name's written on it.

744
01:41:51,198 --> 01:41:56,037
Have some. It's Bill Carson's tobacco.

745
01:41:58,456 --> 01:42:00,333
Aarh!

746
01:42:01,167 --> 01:42:04,170
(mournful tune)

747
01:43:18,911 --> 01:43:23,332
Was Carson dead or alive
when you found him?

748
01:43:28,254 --> 01:43:30,548
What did he tell you about the money?

749
01:43:30,631 --> 01:43:33,259
I don't...

750
01:43:33,342 --> 01:43:36,053
I... I don't know what you're talking about.

751
01:43:54,446 --> 01:43:56,365
More feeling.

752
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:18,470
You can sure consider yourself
much luckier than your pal.

753
01:44:18,554 --> 01:44:21,515
Wallace will punch your friend
as long as the song goes.

754
01:44:21,599 --> 01:44:25,144
So many of us
have had a session in there.

755
01:44:45,748 --> 01:44:49,168
How's your digestion now?

756
01:44:51,879 --> 01:44:57,259
- You'd better talk.
- I have nothing to tell you.

757
01:45:23,619 --> 01:45:26,330
Play that fiddle, you.

758
01:46:01,615 --> 01:46:04,076
(screams)

759
01:46:09,915 --> 01:46:12,126
I'll talk... I'll talk...

760
01:46:21,593 --> 01:46:24,388
What did he say about the money?

761
01:46:24,471 --> 01:46:27,933
It's bu...

762
01:46:28,016 --> 01:46:31,520
It's buried in a grave.

763
01:46:31,603 --> 01:46:33,313
Where?

764
01:46:33,397 --> 01:46:34,815
Sad Hill...

765
01:46:34,898 --> 01:46:37,401
Sad Hill cemetery.

766
01:46:40,112 --> 01:46:42,072
Which grave?

767
01:46:42,156 --> 01:46:46,076
I don't know.
I don't know, I tell you.

768
01:46:47,703 --> 01:46:49,663
Blondie...

769
01:46:49,746 --> 01:46:54,543
Ask Blondie.
He knows the name of the grave.

770
01:47:11,226 --> 01:47:14,354
The war's over for you.

771
01:47:16,315 --> 01:47:19,443
Put those clothes on.

772
01:47:22,654 --> 01:47:24,406
Why?

773
01:47:24,489 --> 01:47:27,451
We're going for a ride.

774
01:47:27,534 --> 01:47:31,538
- Where?
- To find 200,000 dollars.

775
01:47:31,622 --> 01:47:34,833
I know the name of the cemetery now.

776
01:47:34,917 --> 01:47:38,420
And you know the name of the grave.

777
01:47:57,481 --> 01:48:00,609
You're not going to give me
the same treatment?

778
01:48:04,029 --> 01:48:05,989
Would you talk?

779
01:48:06,823 --> 01:48:08,575
No. Probably not.

780
01:48:10,327 --> 01:48:12,913
That's what I thought.

781
01:48:12,996 --> 01:48:15,374
Not that you're any tougher than Tuco,

782
01:48:15,457 --> 01:48:18,835
but you're smart enough to know
that talking won't save you.

783
01:48:22,547 --> 01:48:25,759
And Tuco? Is he...

784
01:48:27,844 --> 01:48:30,931
No. Not yet.

785
01:48:31,014 --> 01:48:33,600
But he's in very good hands.

786
01:48:34,309 --> 01:48:37,813
You've changed partners,
but you've still got the same deal.

787
01:48:37,896 --> 01:48:40,440
I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.

788
01:48:41,775 --> 01:48:45,737
There's two of us.
Should make it easier than just one.

789
01:48:50,575 --> 01:48:52,661
Yeah.

790
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:13,390
Hold it.

791
01:49:13,473 --> 01:49:16,268
That's it. Don't move.

792
01:49:16,351 --> 01:49:21,898
Now, don't breathe. Still... that's it.

793
01:49:21,982 --> 01:49:25,277
Got it. Thank you.

794
01:49:39,875 --> 01:49:43,628
Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?
Where's the rebel going?

795
01:49:43,712 --> 01:49:47,340
To hell, with a rope around his neck
and a price on his head.

796
01:49:47,424 --> 01:49:52,554
3,000 dollars, friend.
That's a lot of money for a head.

797
01:49:52,637 --> 01:49:56,391
I'll bet they didn't even pay you
a penny for your arm.

798
01:50:01,521 --> 01:50:03,273
I told you once, friend.

799
01:50:03,356 --> 01:50:08,195
If I ever get you down, you're gonna
need a lot of help to get up again.

800
01:50:28,131 --> 01:50:30,342
You're a lot luckier than that one.

801
01:50:30,425 --> 01:50:33,011
You get some grub, a rope,
and you're finished.

802
01:50:33,094 --> 01:50:36,973
And there isn't any partner this time
to shoot you down.

803
01:52:04,644 --> 01:52:07,313
(rustling)

804
01:52:18,074 --> 01:52:23,079
If your friends stay out in the damp,
they're liable to catch a cold, aren't they?

805
01:52:23,163 --> 01:52:25,540
Or a bullet.

806
01:52:29,669 --> 01:52:33,047
Hear that, boys?
Come on out here.

807
01:52:44,267 --> 01:52:49,189
Since we're all going in the same
direction, might as well go together.

808
01:52:49,272 --> 01:52:51,733
One, two,

809
01:52:51,816 --> 01:52:53,860
three, four,

810
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:56,738
five, six.

811
01:52:57,197 --> 01:53:00,366
Six... Perfect number.

812
01:53:01,659 --> 01:53:04,621
Isn't three the perfect number?

813
01:53:05,747 --> 01:53:10,210
Yeah. But I got six more bullets in my gun.

814
01:53:11,794 --> 01:53:13,880
(chuckles)

815
01:53:16,633 --> 01:53:18,927
(train whistle)

816
01:54:12,605 --> 01:54:17,277
Sure would like to
put your paw on it, huh?

817
01:54:17,360 --> 01:54:22,073
I would like to piss. It's rough.
I've been on this train nearly ten hours.

818
01:54:22,156 --> 01:54:24,951
You smell like a pig already.

819
01:54:25,034 --> 01:54:27,870
Let's try not to make things any worse.

820
01:54:30,164 --> 01:54:32,250
Get going.

821
01:54:40,466 --> 01:54:44,137
I can't while you're watching me.

822
01:54:55,148 --> 01:54:57,108
Aaaarh!

823
01:55:06,576 --> 01:55:10,329
You made a lot of noise, my friend, huh?

824
01:55:30,641 --> 01:55:34,604
You don't want to break our friendship?
Well, I'll break it.

825
01:55:59,212 --> 01:56:01,798
(train approaching)

826
01:57:18,749 --> 01:57:21,585
Squad, halt.

827
01:57:21,669 --> 01:57:24,547
Take your places.

828
01:57:34,724 --> 01:57:36,642
Ready.

829
01:57:36,726 --> 01:57:38,227
Aim.

830
01:57:38,311 --> 01:57:40,396
Fire.

831
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:59,415
Clem, take care of the horses.

832
01:58:02,626 --> 01:58:05,129
(cannon fire)

833
01:58:21,937 --> 01:58:24,690
(whistle of cannonball)

834
02:01:30,459 --> 02:01:32,628
(splash of water)

835
02:01:45,974 --> 02:01:49,186
(Tuco sings quietly to himself)

836
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:18,423
I've been looking for you for eight months.

837
02:02:18,507 --> 02:02:23,095
Whenever I should have had a gun
in my right hand, I thought of you.

838
02:02:23,178 --> 02:02:27,140
Now I find you in exactly
the position that suits me.

839
02:02:27,224 --> 02:02:33,063
And I had lots of time to learn
how to shoot with my left.

840
02:02:47,035 --> 02:02:51,665
When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.

841
02:02:53,292 --> 02:02:56,378
Every gun makes its own tune.

842
02:02:56,461 --> 02:02:59,923
It's perfect timing, large one.

843
02:03:16,773 --> 02:03:19,318
Clem, follow him.

844
02:03:53,560 --> 02:03:54,936
(tsks)

845
02:04:05,238 --> 02:04:08,617
(banging on door)

846
02:04:16,375 --> 02:04:19,378
Just a minute. I'll be right there.

847
02:04:19,461 --> 02:04:23,215
Just give me time to get dressed
and I'll open up.

848
02:04:40,315 --> 02:04:42,192
(gun cocks)

849
02:04:43,443 --> 02:04:46,988
Put your drawers on
and take your gun off.

850
02:04:55,330 --> 02:04:57,124
Hey...

851
02:04:57,207 --> 02:05:01,878
Hey, Blondie, how the hell
did you get out of that pigsty?

852
02:05:03,380 --> 02:05:07,801
My own way.
I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes.

853
02:05:08,301 --> 02:05:11,721
You talked, you traitor. You talked.

854
02:05:12,347 --> 02:05:17,102
No, I didn't talk.
If I did, I probably wouldn't be here now.

855
02:05:18,395 --> 02:05:21,022
You... me...

856
02:05:21,148 --> 02:05:23,984
So only you know your half of the secret?

857
02:05:24,734 --> 02:05:26,278
Mm-hm.

858
02:05:27,404 --> 02:05:31,032
Ah, Blondie...

859
02:05:31,116 --> 02:05:35,495
I'm very happy you're working with me,
and we're together again.

860
02:05:35,579 --> 02:05:39,166
- I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.
- Oh, listen...

861
02:05:39,249 --> 02:05:43,295
I forgot to mention.

862
02:05:43,378 --> 02:05:48,133
He's not alone.
There's five of them.

863
02:05:48,216 --> 02:05:51,595
- Five?
- Yeah. Five of them.

864
02:05:53,930 --> 02:05:57,642
So that's why you came to Tuco.

865
02:05:59,728 --> 02:06:02,439
It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.

866
02:06:14,075 --> 02:06:17,287
They shot him at close range.

867
02:06:17,370 --> 02:06:19,664
(whistle of cannonball)

868
02:06:35,764 --> 02:06:40,727
- Well, look who's here.
- The other one will be along.

869
02:06:42,729 --> 02:06:46,316
They'll come looking for us.

870
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:48,610
Watch out.

871
02:06:48,693 --> 02:06:51,738
There's two of them.

872
02:06:51,821 --> 02:06:54,074
I want that blond alive.

873
02:07:02,916 --> 02:07:06,628
You, back there.
Come on, let's go.

874
02:07:40,286 --> 02:07:42,622
Were you going to die alone?

875
02:08:57,488 --> 02:09:00,408
(whistle of cannonball)

876
02:09:07,707 --> 02:09:09,792
(coughing)

877
02:09:28,645 --> 02:09:29,729
(whistles)

878
02:09:32,982 --> 02:09:34,275
Ho!

879
02:09:48,581 --> 02:09:50,166
(noise above)

880
02:09:59,342 --> 02:10:02,428
Hey, Blondie. Angel Eyes is mine.

881
02:10:02,512 --> 02:10:04,097
AII right.

882
02:10:43,428 --> 02:10:48,224
"See you soon, l... idi.."

883
02:10:48,307 --> 02:10:50,893
"Idiots."

884
02:10:50,977 --> 02:10:53,271
It's for you.

885
02:11:17,503 --> 02:11:20,465
How peaceful and quiet, amigo.

886
02:11:20,548 --> 02:11:24,218
Like a cemetery, for instance?

887
02:11:24,302 --> 02:11:27,221
There should be a bridge
across that river.

888
02:11:27,305 --> 02:11:32,935
- We better wait for nightfall.
- Trust in me, Blondie.

889
02:11:33,019 --> 02:11:35,771
I got a good sense of where I'm going.

890
02:11:35,855 --> 02:11:39,901
Tuco has taken you this far,
I will take you all the way to...

891
02:11:44,947 --> 02:11:48,034
- Tell the captain.
- Yes, sir.

892
02:11:48,117 --> 02:11:51,454
Come along, now. Follow me.

893
02:12:37,124 --> 02:12:40,670
We found them near the perimeter, sir.

894
02:12:54,141 --> 02:12:56,352
Where do you hail from?

895
02:12:56,435 --> 02:12:57,853
IIlinois.

896
02:13:00,272 --> 02:13:02,149
And you?

897
02:13:02,233 --> 02:13:04,110
I'm with him.

898
02:13:10,074 --> 02:13:13,452
Any reason for being around here?

899
02:13:13,536 --> 02:13:16,497
We want to enlist, General.

900
02:13:19,041 --> 02:13:21,377
You'd better learn to distinguish rank.

901
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:23,546
I'm a captain.

902
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:27,675
Get the hell out.

903
02:13:27,758 --> 02:13:30,761
It sure as hell might be you today,
so go write your will.

904
02:13:30,845 --> 02:13:32,930
Yes, sir.

905
02:13:37,727 --> 02:13:39,979
So you want to enlist?

906
02:13:40,896 --> 02:13:44,650
You've got to take a test to prove it.

907
02:13:52,616 --> 02:13:55,119
Well, show me.

908
02:14:13,053 --> 02:14:16,140
Hey... (chuckles)

909
02:14:17,892 --> 02:14:22,313
You've got a career.
At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel.

910
02:14:22,396 --> 02:14:25,191
- Really?
- Sure.

911
02:14:25,274 --> 02:14:27,401
Like it says in the manual,

912
02:14:27,485 --> 02:14:32,865
you've got every qualification to become
an expert in the use of weapons.

913
02:14:32,948 --> 02:14:38,078
For this, sir, is the most
potent weapon in war. (exhales)

914
02:14:39,830 --> 02:14:43,459
The fighting spirit's in this bottle.

915
02:14:44,585 --> 02:14:46,670
Volunteers.

916
02:14:48,130 --> 02:14:52,593
You want to enlist, hm? Let's go.

917
02:14:52,676 --> 02:14:55,804
Come on, gentlemen, come on.

918
02:14:57,264 --> 02:15:00,726
The shooting hasn't begun yet.
You're in time.

919
02:15:09,193 --> 02:15:10,736
Eh?

920
02:15:16,408 --> 02:15:19,328
Whoever has the most liquor
to get the soldiers drunk

921
02:15:19,411 --> 02:15:23,457
and send them to be slaughtered...
is the winner.

922
02:15:23,540 --> 02:15:29,964
We and the ones over on the other side of
the river only have one thing in common.

923
02:15:30,047 --> 02:15:32,424
AII of us reek of alcohol.

924
02:15:40,224 --> 02:15:42,893
What did you say your name was?

925
02:15:42,977 --> 02:15:44,311
Uh...

926
02:15:45,145 --> 02:15:47,273
And you?

927
02:15:48,065 --> 02:15:49,149
Uh...

928
02:15:49,233 --> 02:15:51,235
"Uh." No.

929
02:15:56,240 --> 02:15:58,951
Names don't matter.

930
02:15:59,034 --> 02:16:04,623
Yes, because soon you can join
the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.

931
02:16:04,707 --> 02:16:07,001
We have two attacks a day.

932
02:16:07,084 --> 02:16:09,753
- Two attacks a day?
- Sure.

933
02:16:09,837 --> 02:16:15,009
The rebs have decided that damn bridge
is the key to this whole area.

934
02:16:15,092 --> 02:16:18,220
Stupid, useless bridge.

935
02:16:18,303 --> 02:16:21,557
Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.

936
02:16:22,599 --> 02:16:28,105
Headquarters has declared
we must take that ridiculous flyspeck.

937
02:16:29,148 --> 02:16:31,316
Even if all of us are killed.

938
02:16:31,400 --> 02:16:36,989
Otherwise the key'll get rusty
and just be a spot on the wall.

939
02:16:37,072 --> 02:16:41,785
And that's not all.
Both sides want the bridge intact.

940
02:16:41,869 --> 02:16:47,124
Intact is how the South wants it,
and we want it intact, too.

941
02:16:48,959 --> 02:16:53,297
You'll all turn to dust,
but one thing is sure, boys:

942
02:16:53,380 --> 02:16:57,760
Branston Bridge will stand unbroken.

943
02:16:57,843 --> 02:17:03,056
Is it bad
to speak the way I do to volunteers?

944
02:17:03,140 --> 02:17:06,435
I've done a lot worse.

945
02:17:09,605 --> 02:17:14,109
I've done it. I've blown it up. Boom!

946
02:17:14,193 --> 02:17:17,404
In here, I've destroyed it all.

947
02:17:18,363 --> 02:17:23,577
It's a court-martial offence to dream
of blowing it up. A serious crime.

948
02:17:23,660 --> 02:17:29,291
Even to think of
destroying that bridge is just...

949
02:17:30,751 --> 02:17:33,003
Why not really blow it up, Captain?

950
02:17:34,671 --> 02:17:38,050
Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.
Let's scare the hell out of them.

951
02:17:38,133 --> 02:17:40,469
(laughs)

952
02:17:41,470 --> 02:17:44,598
I've been dreaming about it.

953
02:17:47,100 --> 02:17:50,562
I've even worked out a plan.

954
02:17:50,646 --> 02:17:52,648
I sure have.

955
02:17:53,565 --> 02:17:56,860
The best time is after the attack,

956
02:17:56,944 --> 02:18:00,822
when there's a truce
to get the wounded.

957
02:18:00,906 --> 02:18:05,911
If I could do it,
I could save many thousands of men.

958
02:18:05,994 --> 02:18:08,288
(soldiers shout)

959
02:18:10,874 --> 02:18:14,002
But what I lack is the guts.

960
02:18:19,216 --> 02:18:22,469
They're beginning
the daily slaughter right on time.

961
02:18:22,553 --> 02:18:25,931
Captain, all companies
are awaiting your orders.

962
02:18:26,014 --> 02:18:28,725
Be right there.

963
02:18:41,238 --> 02:18:43,365
Let's go.

964
02:18:43,448 --> 02:18:45,367
AII right, friends.

965
02:18:45,450 --> 02:18:48,704
Come along and enjoy the spectacle.

966
02:19:08,765 --> 02:19:11,560
(bugle call)

967
02:19:19,026 --> 02:19:21,528
Companies, report.

968
02:19:21,611 --> 02:19:24,406
Company B ready.

969
02:19:24,489 --> 02:19:27,284
Company E ready.

970
02:19:27,367 --> 02:19:30,495
Company D ready.

971
02:19:35,375 --> 02:19:39,129
Companies, forward!

972
02:19:39,212 --> 02:19:41,465
(battle cries)

973
02:20:00,067 --> 02:20:04,029
Hey, Blondie. Looks like the captain
is asking for a bullet in his guts.

974
02:20:04,112 --> 02:20:06,198
Yeah.

975
02:20:58,458 --> 02:21:02,837
I've never seen so many men
wasted so badly.

976
02:21:22,440 --> 02:21:26,820
I have a feeling it's really
going to be a good, long battle.

977
02:21:30,115 --> 02:21:32,325
Blondie...

978
02:21:32,409 --> 02:21:35,036
The money's on the other side of the river.

979
02:21:35,120 --> 02:21:38,039
Oh? Where?

980
02:21:40,375 --> 02:21:44,296
Amigo, I said the other side,
and that's enough.

981
02:21:44,379 --> 02:21:48,925
But while the Confederates are there,
we can't get across.

982
02:21:49,009 --> 02:21:54,139
What would happen if somebody
were to blow up that bridge?

983
02:21:54,222 --> 02:22:00,228
Yeah. Then these idiots
would go somewhere else to fight.

984
02:22:00,312 --> 02:22:02,397
Maybe.

985
02:22:39,559 --> 02:22:43,563
Get a doctor, quick!
The captain's wounded!

986
02:22:44,856 --> 02:22:47,734
Hurry, a stretcher.

987
02:22:48,818 --> 02:22:51,654
Easy. Easy now.

988
02:22:55,533 --> 02:22:56,951
Arh!

989
02:23:01,581 --> 02:23:04,292
Get things ready.

990
02:23:24,145 --> 02:23:26,981
A little of this will help.

991
02:23:32,570 --> 02:23:35,031
Take a slug of this, Captain.

992
02:23:35,114 --> 02:23:37,116
And keep your ears open.

993
02:24:23,705 --> 02:24:25,707
(grunting)

994
02:24:25,790 --> 02:24:29,627
(man) What are you doing?
No... Leave me alone...

995
02:26:08,017 --> 02:26:12,105
Blondie, hey.
You realise we might be risking our lives?

996
02:26:12,647 --> 02:26:18,402
Yeah. And if I get killed, you'll never get
your hands on all that beautiful money.

997
02:26:18,486 --> 02:26:20,321
Yeah, Tuco.

998
02:26:21,239 --> 02:26:23,574
Sure would be a pity.

999
02:26:53,479 --> 02:26:54,647
Doc...

1000
02:26:56,899 --> 02:27:01,696
Doctor... Can you help me
Iive a little longer?

1001
02:27:01,779 --> 02:27:04,740
I expect good news.

1002
02:27:17,003 --> 02:27:18,546
(gasps)

1003
02:27:50,620 --> 02:27:53,372
Eh... Eh...

1004
02:27:54,749 --> 02:27:57,877
Why don't we tell each other
our half of the secret?

1005
02:27:57,960 --> 02:28:00,463
Why don't we?

1006
02:28:01,505 --> 02:28:03,549
You go first.

1007
02:28:05,301 --> 02:28:10,139
No, I think it's better that...

1008
02:28:10,222 --> 02:28:12,600
you start.

1009
02:28:15,770 --> 02:28:18,481
AII right.

1010
02:28:19,315 --> 02:28:23,903
The name of the cemetery is...

1011
02:28:39,794 --> 02:28:42,004
Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.

1012
02:28:50,262 --> 02:28:53,057
The name on the grave is...

1013
02:28:56,519 --> 02:28:58,562
Arch Stanton.

1014
02:28:58,646 --> 02:29:02,149
Ar... Arch Stanton?

1015
02:29:02,233 --> 02:29:04,485
Are you sure?

1016
02:29:04,568 --> 02:29:06,737
Yeah. Sure I'm sure.

1017
02:30:58,974 --> 02:31:01,310
(snoring)

1018
02:34:06,787 --> 02:34:08,956
(grunts)

1019
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:50,080
(horse neighs)

1020
02:35:23,363 --> 02:35:26,324
(Tuco) Haa! Haa!

1021
02:40:55,028 --> 02:40:58,614
It'll be a lot easier with that.

1022
02:41:37,695 --> 02:41:39,864
Two can dig a lot quicker than one.

1023
02:41:40,490 --> 02:41:42,575
Dig.

1024
02:41:44,577 --> 02:41:46,287
You're not digging.

1025
02:41:58,758 --> 02:42:03,137
If you shoot me,
you won't see a cent of that money.

1026
02:42:04,013 --> 02:42:05,348
Why?

1027
02:42:08,267 --> 02:42:10,895
I'll tell you why.

1028
02:42:10,978 --> 02:42:13,481
Cos there's nothing in there.

1029
02:42:21,572 --> 02:42:24,825
- Why, you son of a...
- You thought I'd trust you?

1030
02:42:28,204 --> 02:42:31,832
200,000 dollars is a lot of money.

1031
02:42:31,916 --> 02:42:35,044
We're gonna have to earn it.

1032
02:42:37,630 --> 02:42:39,924
How?

1033
02:42:49,892 --> 02:42:52,728
I'll write the name
on the bottom of this stone.

1034
02:42:56,524 --> 02:42:58,651
The gun?

1035
02:49:04,516 --> 02:49:08,687
You pig! You wanted to get me killed!
When did you unload it?

1036
02:49:10,689 --> 02:49:12,899
Last night.

1037
02:49:12,983 --> 02:49:17,696
You see, in this world,
there's two kinds of people, my friend:

1038
02:49:17,779 --> 02:49:22,451
those with loaded guns
and those who dig.

1039
02:49:22,534 --> 02:49:24,494
You dig.

1040
02:49:24,578 --> 02:49:26,705
Where?

1041
02:49:36,506 --> 02:49:38,884
Here.

1042
02:49:39,801 --> 02:49:41,678
Unk... Un...

1043
02:49:41,762 --> 02:49:44,681
There's no name on it.

1044
02:49:44,765 --> 02:49:47,476
And there's no name here, either.

1045
02:49:48,769 --> 02:49:51,772
You see, that's what Bill Carson told me.

1046
02:49:51,855 --> 02:49:56,651
It was the grave marked "unknown",
right beside Arch Stanton.

1047
02:50:03,450 --> 02:50:05,952
Go ahead.

1048
02:50:19,591 --> 02:50:22,469
(little pants of excitement)

1049
02:51:02,717 --> 02:51:06,471
Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie!

1050
02:51:22,445 --> 02:51:27,617
You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't...
You wouldn't play a joke on me like that.

1051
02:51:27,701 --> 02:51:31,037
It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.

1052
02:51:31,121 --> 02:51:34,499
I want you to stand up there
and put your head in that noose.

1053
02:51:53,435 --> 02:51:55,604
(cross creaks)

1054
02:52:41,650 --> 02:52:45,695
Well, now... Seems just like old times.

1055
02:52:50,283 --> 02:52:52,994
Four for you.

1056
02:52:54,204 --> 02:52:57,332
And four...

1057
02:52:58,500 --> 02:53:01,002
Four for me.

1058
02:53:27,028 --> 02:53:28,446
Hey, Blon...

1059
02:53:28,530 --> 02:53:29,864
Blon...

1060
02:53:38,998 --> 02:53:41,376
Hey, Blondie...

1061
02:53:42,627 --> 02:53:45,338
Sorry, Tuco.

1062
02:53:48,341 --> 02:53:49,717
Blondie...

1063
02:53:58,852 --> 02:54:01,187
Blondie!

1064
02:54:09,028 --> 02:54:11,197
Blondie!

1065
02:54:20,957 --> 02:54:22,041
Blondie...

1066
02:54:32,677 --> 02:54:34,554
Blondie...

1067
02:54:49,736 --> 02:54:52,405
Blondie!

1068
02:55:13,593 --> 02:55:16,471
You son of a bitch...

1069
02:55:18,806 --> 02:55:21,267
Blondie...

1070
02:55:42,121 --> 02:55:44,499
Aaaarhh!

1071
02:56:20,410 --> 02:56:23,579
Hey, Blondie!

1072
02:56:24,455 --> 02:56:27,750
You know what you are?

1073
02:56:30,962 --> 02:56:32,839
Just a dirty son of a...

1074
02:56:32,922 --> 02:56:38,177
(melds into theme music)


1
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,760
I remember those cheers,

2
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,960
they still ring in my ears,

3
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:03,900
and for years
they remain in my thoughts,

4
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:05,340
'cause one night,

5
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,500
I took off my robe,
and what'd I do?

6
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,740
I forgot to wear shorts.

7
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,410
I recall every fall,
every hook, every jab,

8
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,680
the worst way a guy
can get rid of his flab,

9
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:21,080
as you know,
my life wasn't drab.

10
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,920
Though I'd much...

11
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,260
Though I'd rather hear you
cheer when you delve--

12
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,330
Though I'd rather hear you cheer
when I delve into Shakespeare...

13
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:33,200
"A horse! A horse!
My kingdom for a horse!"

14
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,270
I haven't had a winner
in six months.

15
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,910
And though I'm no Olivier,
I would much rather...

16
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,610
And though I'm no Olivier,
if he fought Sugar Ray,

17
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,550
he would say that the thing
ain't the ring, it's the play.

18
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:54,050
So, give me a stage where
this bull here can rage,

19
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,120
and though I can fight,
I'd much rather recite.

20
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,780
That's entertainment.

21
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,830
That's entertainment.

22
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,560
Jake La Motta
and Jimmy Reeves

23
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,140
in the Cleveland Arena.

24
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,260
La Motta is undefeated,
but he's well behind on points.

25
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,470
The Bronx Bull has taken
a lot of punishment in this bout.

26
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:19,840
Jake is cut around the left eye.
Jimmy Reeves has outboxed him...

27
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,250
Jack, tell me, why the fuck do we
have to come to Cleveland for you

28
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,480
to get beaten by a mulignane?

29
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:26,490
Come on, do the fuckin' right thing.

30
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,750
He's got you by the balls,
you're outpointed.

31
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,480
You're comin' up for the tenth,
you're gonna have to knock him out.

32
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,750
I want you to bite him, kick him,
do anything you gotta do.

33
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,690
Nobody's lookin',
you know what to do.

34
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,770
Just like home--
all over the fuckin' moolies.

35
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,660
Knock the motherfucker out.
You understand? Knock him out.

36
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,030
Hey, you wanna go in there?
You wanna go in and do it?

37
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,200
Help!

38
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,780
We need a knockout,
let's go get a knockout,

39
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,850
that's where it's at.

40
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,640
Tenth and final round.
Good luck to you both.

41
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,780
La Motta fighting
out of a half crouch.

42
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,880
Reeves is up against
a tough fighter,

43
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:01,960
a man who doesn't know
how to back up.

44
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:05,620
La Motta continues to bore in,
out of the bob and weave,

45
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,220
hooks a left hand to the jaw,
and Reeves is down!

46
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,230
The crowd is urging Jake on.

47
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,230
The referee is tolling over Reeves.
He's got to get up.

48
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,970
La Motta comes at him once again,
Reeves misses a right,

49
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,970
takes a left, and another left,
a hard left hand to the jaw,

50
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,510
and Reeves is down
for the second time.

51
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,840
A determined Jake La Motta
is making a great comeback

52
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,420
here in the tenth round.

53
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,580
Reeves is up again.
La Motta comes at him.

54
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,850
A left hook to the jaw,
another left, and a right to the body.

55
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,590
Three more lefts to the midsection,
a hook on the jaw,

56
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,690
two more lefts to the head,
a right and a left to the jaw.

57
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,790
Reeves goes down
for the third time,

58
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,160
and the referee
is pulling La Motta away.

59
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,260
Two... three...

60
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,860
four... five...

61
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,460
- The referee is counting over Reeves,
- six... seven...

62
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:55,600
- but time is running out...
- eight... nine...

63
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,180
...and there is the bell.

64
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:01,370
He can't walk, but Reeves
has been saved by the bell.

65
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,380
But did La Motta
do it soon enough?

66
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,920
Jack, Jack, come here.

67
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,890
It's no good.
This is Ohio, not New York!

68
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,320
- You waited too long!
- That dumb bastard!

69
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,290
Put the robe on right, huh?
Put my robe on right!

70
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,550
Ladies and gentlemen...

71
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,100
...under the rules of
the Ohio Boxing Commission,

72
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,840
after ten rounds,

73
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,500
the winner,
by unanimous decision,

74
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,480
- Jimmy Reeves!
- The colorful Jake La Motta,

75
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,610
the Bronx Bull,
has lost his first fight.

76
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,850
That's Jake's fight!
Come on, that's Jake's fight!

77
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,320
Jake won that fight!

78
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:48,360
Don't leave. Don't get outta
the fuckin' ring. Stay here.

79
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,300
You won-- let him go first.
Stay in, I'm tellin' you.

80
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,100
La Motta floored Reeves
seven times in the fight,

81
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,500
but La Motta still lost the fight.

82
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,540
Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake!

83
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:20,720
Help!

84
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,110
...on his fuckin' back,
they pick up his arm, he's dead.

85
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,710
They tell him he won the fight.
People went crazy.

86
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:52,760
That shit woulda never happened if
Tommy was there takin' care of it.

87
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:56,090
He's gotta be with Tommy to fight
in New York, to get a title shot.

88
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,130
He's gonna wind up
punch-drunk, your brother.

89
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,460
- I know.
- You know.

90
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,030
You gotta make him understand it's
the best thing for everybody involved.

91
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,040
- I said I know.
- You know,

92
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,770
but you gotta make him know,
make him understand it.

93
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,210
Jesus Christ, you wanna stop?

94
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,210
When the fuck
you gonna stop with that stuff?

95
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,140
I told ya,
I understand everything.

96
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,220
He just wants to do
things for himself.

97
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,220
- Hard to understand?
- It's because he's got a head

98
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,220
- like concrete.
- You make me laugh.

99
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:21,410
You think it's easy?
Why don't you talk to him?

100
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,320
- You know what to say.
- You know I can't talk to him.

101
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,320
- Why can't you talk to him?
- 'Cause he don't like me.

102
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,090
Nobody likes you,
you oughta be used to it.

103
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,160
They knew.

104
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,700
They knew who was the boss.

105
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,170
The judges didn't know. Who knows
what happened with them?

106
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,070
The people knew.

107
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:45,510
You don't believe me, you thought
I was over there foolin' around, huh?

108
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:48,580
You thought I was foolin' around,
didn't ya? Tell me the truth.

109
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,620
I ain't doin' no foolin' around.

110
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,880
- That's in your mind.
- Yeah, so what?

111
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,450
That championship belt on me,
that's when I fool around.

112
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,530
Is it done?

113
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,000
No, it's not done.

114
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:06,800
Don't overcook it.
You overcook it, it's no good.

115
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:10,040
It defeats its own purpose.

116
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:16,880
What are you doin'?
I just said don't overcook it.

117
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:19,050
You're overcookin' it,
bring it over.

118
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,220
- You want your steak?
- Bring it over.

119
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,450
Bring it over!

120
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,660
It's like a piece of charcoal!
Bring it over here!

121
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,160
- You want your steak?
- Yeah, right now!

122
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,930
Good.
There's your stupid steak.

123
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,500
- Can't wait for it to be done?
- No, I can't wait.

124
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,600
Good. Okay? Happy?

125
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,270
- Happy?
- That's all I want.

126
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,240
That's-- there, no, more. There.

127
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,940
Botherin' me about a steak, huh?
You're botherin' me about a steak?!

128
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,020
I agree with you.
He should be with Tommy.

129
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,950
If he's in a good mood, I'll talk to him.
What the fuck you want me to do?

130
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,850
Tommy tells me
every day to talk to you

131
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,450
and speak to Jake
to straighten this thing out,

132
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,080
I'm gonna wind up in the middle.

133
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:56,490
You're in the middle?
I'm his brother.

134
00:09:56,590 --> 00:09:58,790
- He's got me fuckin' nuts.
- You're his brother.

135
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,260
If you can't talk to him,
who's gonna talk to him?

136
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,870
- I'll talk to him.
- Do what you can, that's all.

137
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,700
- That's all I'm askin' you.
- I'll see you tomorrow.

138
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,100
- Let me go up.
- All right? Where you gonna be?

139
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,200
I'll be at the gym
or the other joint, one of the two.

140
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,210
- I'll catch you by the gym.
- All right. Sal?

141
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,300
Yeah?

142
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,210
Complain some more,
I wanna hear.

143
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,220
- Complain? You call those carrots?
- That's right.

144
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,150
- You call that food?
- You ate 'em. Did you eat them?

145
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,950
You call that food?
I got no choice!

146
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,750
- I'm sick of you already!
- I got no choice!

147
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,730
- I can't believe you!
- I got no choice!

148
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,390
You got no choice?
Get away from me!

149
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,800
- Please!
- Get in there. Get in there!

150
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,500
Get your hands off me,
get away from me!

151
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,500
Fuck! I'm sick of you!

152
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,630
What's the matter with you,
you animals?

153
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,300
- What?!
- Jack, come on!

154
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,400
- You animals!
- Come on, huh?

155
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,640
This son of a bitch
is callin' me an animal.

156
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,150
- Hey, you!
- Come on, Jack.

157
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,910
I'm gonna get hold of that dog,
and I'm gonna eat it for lunch!

158
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,450
You hear what I'm sayin'?
You hear me, Larry?

159
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,750
- Larry?
- Crazy animal!

160
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,330
Who's an animal?
Your mother's an animal!

161
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,290
You son of a bitch!

162
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,460
You're gonna find your dog dead
in the hallway tomorrow, ya bum.

163
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,030
- I can't take it!
- The whole block,

164
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:12,190
- people could hear you.
- I'll kill the whole family.

165
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,860
- Sit down, relax.
- I can't take this anymore!

166
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,870
You break anything
in there, I'm gonna kill ya!

167
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,770
I swear to God, I'm gonna
come in there and kill ya.

168
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,340
Yeah, sure.

169
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,610
You wanna calm down?

170
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:27,620
Oh, fuck!

171
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,780
What'd I do?

172
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:33,960
Come on, honey,
let's be friends.

173
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,460
- Truce, all right?
- It's not all right!

174
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,060
You can't, I'm telling you--

175
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,930
you can't fuckin' eat
and drink like an animal,

176
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,300
put up with
this fuckin' brasciole here.

177
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,670
You can't do this.
I'm tellin' ya.

178
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,540
Forget about the Reeves thing,
you got a million other fights comin' up.

179
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,610
You just can't keep doin' this.

180
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,340
What's wrong?

181
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,640
Something's the matter,
what's up?

182
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,120
You know what's botherin' me?

183
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,090
My hands.

184
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,760
Your hands?
What about 'em?

185
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,270
I got these small hands.
I got a little girl's hands.

186
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,500
I got 'em, too.
What's the difference?

187
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,110
Know what that means?

188
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,370
No matter how big I get,
no matter who I fight,

189
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,940
no matter what I do,
I ain't never gonna fight Joe Louis.

190
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,290
That's right, he's a heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

191
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,750
I ain't never gonna get a chance
to fight the best there is.

192
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:45,620
And you know somethin'?
I'm better than them.

193
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,660
I ain't never gonna get a chance.

194
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,960
You're asking me what's wrong.

195
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:57,340
You're crazy to even
think about somethin' like that.

196
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,470
He's a fuckin' heavyweight,
you're a middleweight.

197
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,340
It's impossible, it'll never happen,
so why go crazy thinkin' about it?

198
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,570
It's not normal.

199
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,420
Do me a favor.

200
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,320
- Yeah, what?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

201
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:16,890
- What?
- I want you to hit me in the face.

202
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,890
Forget about it.

203
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,120
I want you to hit me
in the face, go ahead.

204
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:24,220
- Take your best shot.
- Forget about it, I ain't doin' it.

205
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,770
We have fights all the time--
are you worried now?

206
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,000
Hit me in the face.
Go ahead.

207
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,440
- No.
- What, are you afraid?

208
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,530
Afraid of what?

209
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,940
Come on, don't be
a little faggot, hit me.

210
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,880
- I ain't a fag.
- Take your best shot, go ahead.

211
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,210
Come on. You gotta be a real jerk,
you want me to punch you in the face.

212
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,390
Did I not tell you just to do it?
Now I'm tellin' you, you gotta do it.

213
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,950
I ain't hittin' ya.

214
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm your older brother, Joey.
I'm tellin' ya somethin'.

215
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,860
I know what you said.
I ain't doin' it.

216
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,630
I don't care if you get mad,
I ain't doin' it.

217
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,300
Fuckin' nut.

218
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,230
I'm not doin' it,
I'm not gonna do it.

219
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,030
I don't have any gloves. What am I
gonna hit you with, the table?

220
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,840
- I ain't doin' it.
- Use that over there.

221
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:11,070
- What?
- That's right, use that.

222
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,410
Wrap it around your hand!
How many times I gotta tell you?

223
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,250
- Not too many more.
- Go ahead.

224
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,650
- You want me to hit you?
- I want you to hit me

225
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:21,850
with everything you got. I want you
to fuckin' lay me out, go ahead.

226
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,930
- You sure?
- Yeah.

227
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,290
- Go ahead.
- All right.

228
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,490
- Harder.
- Yeah?

229
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,260
You throw a punch like
you take it up the ass, come on.

230
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,030
Harder, harder.

231
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,930
- Harder.
- That's hard, you fuck.

232
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,300
- What do you want?
- Take it off.

233
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,800
- Take it off.
- Come on, you wanna stop now?

234
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,170
- That's enough with that--
- Take it off.

235
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,400
Come on.

236
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,640
- Come on.
- Don't fuck around.

237
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,340
- What are you, a girl?
- Oh, girl, huh?

238
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,070
I'm gonna smack you again,
throw it again.

239
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,270
- That's enough.
- Go ahead.

240
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,180
- I said that's enough!
- Harder, harder.

241
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,950
No, your fuckin' cuts
are opening and everything.

242
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,580
What are you tryin' to prove?
What does it prove?

243
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,210
Hey, Vito.

244
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,760
Joey, what's what?

245
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,090
Jake, you're lookin' good.

246
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,660
How you doin'?

247
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,400
Don't stay here.

248
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,460
Joey.

249
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,470
Come here.

250
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,680
Yeah, he looks mad, huh?

251
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,970
Looks mad.

252
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,510
Spoke to him yesterday,
I don't know.

253
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,550
You told 'em to come up here?

254
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:46,910
Answer me when I talk to you.

255
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,820
Yeah, why?
I can't have my friends up here?

256
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:52,120
- I heard this fucker didn't win the fight.
- Take it easy.

257
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:54,320
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, hear me?

258
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:55,400
Hear me? Come on.

259
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,630
- Come on!
- They look like two fags over there.

260
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,740
We're gonna go,
I'll call you tomorrow, huh?

261
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,180
Hey, Jake, watch you
don't hurt yourself.

262
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:29,020
How's your wife?
Is everything okay?

263
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,530

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,730

You gotta make a fuckin' jerk outta me.

266
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,970
They only came up here 'cause Tommy
told 'em to come up to try to help us.

267
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,010
What's the matter with you, help who?
What's the matter with you?

268
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,770
How they gonna help me?
What, by takin' my money?

269
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,870
Is that what youse talkin' about,
takin' my money?

270
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm here breakin' my ass, not them.

271
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,080
Don't ever bring 'em
up here again, you hear me?

272
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:56,250

273
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,920
I'm a jerk?
You're a fuckin' asshole.

00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,390

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,390
Maybe you can't, huh?

277
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,840
Ya fuck!

278
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,920
Come on, give me a Coke.

279
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,860
Hey, shove off.
You gonna go to the dance?

280
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,520
Go to the dance?

281
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,240
- Who's that girl over there?
- The one I was talkin' to?

282
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,310
- Yeah.
- The blonde?

283
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,880
- Yeah.
- Vickie, you mean.

284
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,950
- Where's she from?
- She's from the neighborhood,

285
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,110
she's a neighborhood girl.

286
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,150
What's her last name?

287
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,750
Vickie, that's all I know.
They call her Vickie.

288
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:08,120
She knows them?

289
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,200
She knows them, they know her,
she comes to the pool every day.

290
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,960
Everybody knows each other--
you know how that shit works.

291
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:17,200
- She go with them?
- She don't go with nobody.

292
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,670
She's 15 years old,
where the fuck's she gonna go?

293
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,540
Where ya gonna take her,
the Copacabana?

294
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,740
I heard there was
a girl that he went with

295
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,900
that was a very beautiful
young girl, blonde.

296
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,750
- Yeah?
- It's not her?

297
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,550
I doubt it very much.

298
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,880
What are you
thinkin' about, anyway?

299
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,420
She ain't the kinda girl
you just fuck and forget about.

300
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,010
Joey, how many times
I gotta tell ya?

301
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:41,650
Why are you always cursin'
when I'm talkin' to you?

302
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,600
Don't do it around me.
Do it around your friends.

303
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,330
- It's that thing, just don't do it.
- All right, she's--

304
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,400
The kinda girl you bang
and forget about-- she's not like that.

305
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,100
You gotta spend time
with her, get involved.

306
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:54,440
You know, it's...

307
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,770
D'you bang her?

308
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,940
- No.
- Tell me the truth.

309
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:02,480
I just told you the truth.
I tell you the truth the first time,

310
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,550
you don't have to ask me again,
I never do that.

311
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,750
I always tell you the truth.
If I did it, you would know.

312
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,190
I took her out
a couple of times.

313
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,660
You went with her?
You didn't try to fuck her?

314
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,820
I try to fuck anything,
you know that.

315
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:18,230
- She didn't go with you?
- No, she didn't go for it.

316
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,990
- Naturally.
- Naturally?

317
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,330
- She knew better.
- What do you mean, she knew better?

318
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,090
She knew you were an animal,

319
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,170
she knew it was no good
if you'd go with her.

320
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,070
Her reputation would be ruined.

321
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:30,980
I thought he was
talkin' to you, Vickie.

322
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,010
- That's--
- That's the same guy?

323
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,840
- Yeah, it's the same guy.
- I gotta break his legs.

324
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,940
He was over here yesterday.

325
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,350
- He was here yesterday?
- You missed him.

326
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,850
I was up to the house yesterday.
Didn't know he was over here.

327
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,250
- You stay in there, I'll go find him.
- No, I can catch him.

328
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,350
Your friends, they're in a huddle.
Big business meeting.

329
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,420
Come by the pool,
they sit around and talk.

330
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:51,120
Big deals.
They make sure she can hear.

331
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,670
Hey, like the big man.
Get the fuck outta here.

332
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,610
Where you goin',
gettin' in the water?

333
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:00,070
Don't get your hair wet.

334
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,440
Big shot.

335
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,780
Get him alone in the back room,
smack him around, no more big shot--

336
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,180
without his gun.

337
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:14,120
Yeah, real tough guys.

338
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,960
- They're all tough guys.
- What are you thinkin' about?

339
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,620
Keep lookin'. Where the fuck you goin'?
You're dead, you're married.

340
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:26,630
You're a married man, it's all over.
Leave the young girls for me.

341
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,130
Big shot.

342
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:39,810
Let's get outta here.
You gonna stay here all night?

343
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:41,040
We'll never get through.

344
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,380
Where the hell do you think
you're goin' at this hour?

345
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,470
What are you, a cop?
I'm goin' out. Business.

346
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,650
Fuckin' worm.
You go out, I'm goin' out.

347
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,380
Do what you're gonna do,
what do I care?

348
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:50,460
Run out, see if I care.

349
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,320
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back!

350
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,550
Fuckin' bunch of guineas.

351
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,130
- You're always hangin' out together!
- Why don't you stop already?

352
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:57,250
Why don't you fuckin' stop?
You're not goin' on business.

353
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,590
- You're goin' to suck each other off!
- Why don't you have some respect?

354
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,930
- The whole buildin' hears ya.
- Suck him! Suck him, baby!

355
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,480
Hey, Larry! Now you got
somethin' to talk about

356
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,950
with that fuckin' dog,
and this one up there.

357
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:10,180
Fuckin' Jew cunt, why don't you
hit her in the head with a bat?

358
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,720
Don't call her no names,
she's still my wife.

359
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,590
- How much abuse you wanna take?
- I hit her enough.

360
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,280
- What am I supposed to do?
- Kill the fuck.

361
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:17,790
Go ahead!
Just leave me here like a dog!

362
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,690
You and your fuckin' ass--
you, too ya-- go out!

363
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,430
- What's the matter with you?!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?

364
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,900
- You gotta leave me here?!
- You let the whole block hear you.

365
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,900
- What's the matter with you?!
- I could give a shit, ya fuckin' queer!

366
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,670
- Faggot! Go stick it up his ass!
- What'd you say?!

367
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:39,270
Oh! Beans!

368
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,480
Jack.

369
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,790
Beansy got a table in the back,
he said we could sit with them.

370
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,420
Beansy who?
Which Beansy?

371
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,190
- Huh?
- Beansy who?

372
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,930
Beans, you know,
he's one of the guys.

373
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,270
- You'll know him when you see him.
- She'll be over there?

374
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,770
I don't know, but you could see
from there, at least.

375
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:06,270
- Come on, let's go.
- I don't wanna look too hard.

376
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,540
- Hello, Joe, how you doin'?
- Beansy, what is it?

377
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,640
Thanks for the seats.

378
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,090
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey, what's up? Hey.

379
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:23,460
Nothing. I got trouble with these two
motherfuckin' greaseballs downstairs,

380
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,960
- they got me crazy.
- Hello, Father, how ya doin'?

381
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:28,400
- Hey, Father, what is it?
- Oh, ho, Father!

382
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,260
You wanna get laid?
You sure?

383
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,800
- You sure?
- Hey, no, no.

384
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,530
Father, where you goin'?
Bless the table, give us a shot.

385
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,370
D'you put money

386
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,160
- You see her right there?
- I saw, I saw.

387
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,560
- Okay?
- I saw.

388
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,860
- They're goin' with her.
- Don't worry about them, go ahead.

389
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:08,940
Go ahead.

390
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,080
Get the fuck out,
you greaseball bastard!

391
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,660
Get out! Get out!

392
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,050
You, too, get out.

393
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,850
Get outta here,
ya fuckin' bum, ya!

394
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,360
- Rotten bastards!
- Go back where you came from.

395
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,760
Hey, Vickie!

396
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,670
- Hi, Joey.
- How you doin'?

397
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,710
- I'm all right, what are you doin'?
- Nothin' much, what are you doin'?

398
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,910
- That your car?
- No, it's my brother's.

399
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,610
D'you ever meet my brother?

400
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,520
- No, Is that him?
- Yeah. Wanna meet him?

401
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,950
- All right.
- Hey, Jack!

402
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,450
There.

403
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,230
Vickie, this is my brother Jake.
He's gonna be the next champ.

404
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,470
Hi.

405
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:54,300
How you doin'?

406
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,970
Nice to meet you.

407
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,750
- Nice car.
- You like that car?

408
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,720
Yeah. It's nice.

409
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,930
Where you from?

410
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,560
Around here.

411
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:24,630
You wanna go for a ride?

412
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,440
All right. Gotta give me a few minutes,
I have to change, okay?

413
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:33,780
- All right?
- All right.

414
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,410
- I'll be back in a little while
- I'll be over there.

415
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,650
Okay.

416
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,120
Move over.

417
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,070
- I never played this game.
- Go ahead.

418
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:04,640
It's the only way you're gonna learn.
Here, I'll show you how to do it.

419
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,520
That's the way, that's right.

420
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,740
- Like this?
- Yeah, that's right.

421
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:11,510
- Hit it?
- Just hit it nice.

422
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,020
Hit the middle one.

423
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,600
You see it?

424
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,630
No.

425
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,960
What does that mean?

426
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,960
It means the game is over.

427
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,290
Come on, let's go.

428
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,630
Daddy?

429
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,420
Dad?
Come on in.

430
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:14,390
Probably went shoppin'
or somethin', let me see.

431
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,290
Yeah, he must have
went shoppin'. Sit down.

432
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,110
- You want somethin' to eat?
- No.

433
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,010
- You sure?
- Mm-hmm.

434
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,950
Salute.

435
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,400
Why don't you sit over here?
Sit a little closer.

436
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,580
You're so far away, like you're
on the other side of the room.

437
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:29,660
Come here,
come here.

438
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,740
Come here.
Sit over here.

439
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,600
Come on,
come up from there.

440
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,540
That's better.

441
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,150
No, thank you anyway.

442
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,650
Some water?

443
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,830
Wanna see the rest
of the place?

444
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,160
All right.

445
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,740
I bought it for my father.
I bought the building.

446
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,970
Oh, yeah?

447
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:11,410
- From fightin'?
- Yeah.

448
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,070
What else?

449
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,590
This is the dining room.

450
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,260
That's a bird.

451
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,830
It was a bird.
It's dead now, I think.

452
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,600
The restroom.

453
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,310
Sit down.

454
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,970
That's me and my brother.
We were foolin' around.

455
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,370
I know.

456
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,180
You look good, though.

457
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,160
What are you smilin' about?

458
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,150
I don't know.

459
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,500
You know how beautiful you are?

460
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,330
Anybody ever tell you
how beautiful you are?

461
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,200
Yeah, they tell you
all the time.

462
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,240
Sugar Ray Robinson
and Jake La Motta in Detroit

463
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,570
for their second fight.

464
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,650
The undefeated Sugar Ray
defeated Jake

465
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,310
at Madison Square Garden
last October.

466
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,990
You can see the contrast
in their styles--

467
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:38,250
the speedy Ray Robinson
up on his toes, the dancing master.

468
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,380
La Motta the brawler
moves in flat-footed most of the time.

469
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,290
Now he's hurt Robinson.

470
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,660
La Motta coming
at Robinson again,

471
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,860
both hands to the head,
a left and a right to the jaw.

472
00:31:48,970 --> 00:31:51,700
A hard left hand to the body
thrown by La Motta.

473
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,570
Round 8, and it's anybody's fight
at this point. 10-rounder.

474
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,740
La Motta drives both hands
to the head, hurts Robinson again.

475
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:01,340
Hooks the left hand to the jaw,
a right to the body.

476
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,780
Robinson comes back
with a right on the nose.

477
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,010
La Motta drives him across
the ring, a left and a right to the head.

478
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,020
A hard left hand to the body,
and Robinson is driven out of the ring

479
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,180
for the first knockdown of his career.

480
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,420
This is the nearest
Robinson has been to a loss.

481
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,240
The fight nears its end.
La Motta has taken charge of the fight.

482
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,640
The undefeated Sugar Ray--
his winning ways are in jeopardy.

483
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:35,870
La Motta coming at him again.
La Motta, feigning a left hand.

484
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,920
After ten rounds,

485
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:50,890
Judge Rossi,
8-2, La Motta.

486
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,900
Judge Murphy,
7-3, La Motta.

487
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,670
La Motta has won the fight!

488
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,600
A unanimous decision
for the Bronx Bull.

489
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:04,230
Jake La Motta handing
Sugar Ray Robinson

490
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:08,050
his first loss as a professional,
and Robinson doesn't like it.

491
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,320
With this stunning victory,
La Motta broke what was considered

492
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,360
the impossible--
the invincible Sugar Ray's record.

493
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,630
La Motta has proved himself
a great fighter,

494
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,260
and he shouldn't be denied a shot
at the middleweight crown.

495
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,310
You sure we should be doin' this?

496
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,230
Come here.

497
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,810
You said never to touch you
before a fight.

498
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:35,150
Come here,
before I give you a beatin'.

499
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,650
You said I couldn't.
You've been good for two weeks.

500
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,650
Come here.

501
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,160
Come here.

502
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,210
Touch my boo-boos.

503
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,640
"Boo-ba?"

504
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,620
Boo-boo.
Give the boo-boo a kiss.

505
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,620
Make it better.

506
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:32,160
Take off my pants.

507
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,470
You know how to
take off my pants?

508
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,060
Now take off the rest.

509
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,130
You made me promise
not to get you excited.

510
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,360
Go ahead, do it.

511
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,280
Take off your panties.

512
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,570
I like the gym smell.

513
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:10,930
What?

514
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,340
I like the smell of the gym.

515
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,130
No, no, no, no.
Enough, enough.

516
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,480
I can't do any more.
If I do any more, I'll sink it.

517
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:53,140
I gotta fight Robinson,
I can't fool around.

518
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:26,670
What are you doin'?

519
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,910
What are you doin'?
What are you doin' to me?

520
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,520
Jake La Motta
and Sugar Ray Robinson

521
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,950
meet for the third time.

522
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:12,460
These men are unique,
becoming classic rivals.

523
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,190
These two men--
fierce, powerful fighters,

524
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,630
dangerous-- so much so that
no other fighter will go near them.

525
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,670
And so, they fight each other,
three weeks apart.

526
00:38:21,770 --> 00:38:23,100
They've each won one,

527
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:26,440
and they'll probably fight again,
the way it looks now.

528
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,510
They go to close quarters at the bell.

529
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:37,050
Round 7,
with Sugar Ray well ahead on points,

530
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,950
La Motta may need a knockout.

531
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,880
The left hook to the jaw,

532
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,980
and Robinson is down
for the second time in his career.

533
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,290
He was down
in the last fight, too.

534
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,660
La Motta watches Sugar Ray
take the count from the referee.

535
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,430
- Robinson trying to get up.
- ...six... seven...

536
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,770
- eight...
- He's up on his feet now,

537
00:38:55,870 --> 00:38:58,860
and the referee is wiping off
his gloves. He is stunned.

538
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,630
La Motta comes at him.

539
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,080
Despite being knocked down,
Robinson is well ahead on points.

540
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:08,880
He hooks a left to the jaw, a left
and a right to the head by Robinson.

541
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,260
Your attention, fans.

542
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,030
Judge Joe Lanahan

543
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:17,930
scores it 8-1, 1-even,

544
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,600
in favor
of Sugar Ray Robinson!

545
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,930
Boo! Boo!

546
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,940
A big vote
for Sugar Ray Robinson.

547
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,280
...of 6-2, and 2-even,

548
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:31,820
for the winner
by unanimous decision,

549
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,410
Sugar Ray Robinson!

550
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,990
Cocksuckers!
I'd like to fuckin'--

551
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:45,160
- For Christ's sake!
- I'll kill those cocksuckers!

552
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,720
They only gave him
that fuckin' decision

553
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:50,430
'cause he's goin' in the Army
next week, that's the only reason.

554
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,300
I knocked him down,
I don't know what else I gotta do.

555
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,930
- What the hell I gotta do?
- You won and they robbed ya!

556
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,410
They're miserable,
because their mothers take it up

557
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,040
the fuckin' ass, that's why!

558
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,450
I've done a lot of bad things, Joey.
Maybe it's comin' back to me.

559
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,590
Who knows? I'm a jinx, maybe.
Who the hell knows?

560
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:11,950
Forget about all that shit--
this was your shot.

561
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,690
They robbed us!
They out and out robbed us!

562
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,030
- It's Vickie, you wanna talk to her?
- I don't wanna talk to nobody.

563
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,470
- Joey, take her home.
- All right.

564
00:40:28,510 --> 00:40:30,840
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

565
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,100
You sure?

566
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:34,740
- Make sure she's all right.
- All right.

567
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:02,110
Yeah, child. I am coming back and bash
you on your head one more time.

568
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:04,350
Don't ever do
that Janiro bullshit again,

569
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,520
no more deals like that,
you hear what I'm sayin'?

570
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,560
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

571
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,890
Look at that-- 168 pounds.

572
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,190
- Stop eatin'.
- What's with the smart answers?

573
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:15,460
I told ya I didn't wanna do it
in the first place, didn't I?

574
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,660
No, you didn't say that.

575
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,670
You're the one that told me
you could get down to 155 pounds.

576
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:21,640
Where'd I get it?
Did I pull it out of the fuckin' air?

577
00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:23,570
I don't know if I'm gonna
make it down to 155.

578
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,740
I'm lucky I make it to 160.

579
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:28,210
And on top of that,
you sign me for a fight at 155,

580
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:31,310
and If I don't make
the 155, I lose $15,000?!

581
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,580
- That's right.
- You're supposed to be a manager!

582
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,210
You're supposed to know
what you're doin'.

583
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:38,220
- I did just what I wanted to do.
- That's what I'm worried about, you--

584
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:39,920
- You want a title shot?
- What are ya talkin' about?

585
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:43,090
- Do you want a title shot?
- What am I, in a circus over here?

586
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,720
I ask him, he's got more sense
about this. What are you doin'?

587
00:44:45,830 --> 00:44:48,100
You been killin' yourself
for three years now, right?

588
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,500
There's nobody's left for you to fight.
Everybody's afraid to fight you.

589
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,000
Along comes this kid Janiro.
He don't know any better.

590
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:57,630
He's a young kid, up and comin',
he'll fight anybody.

591
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,010
Good, you fight him.

592
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:02,440
Bust his hole. Tear him apart.
What are you worried about?

593
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:04,210
What's the biggest thing
you got to worry about?

594
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,180
- I'm worried about the weight.
- You're worried about the weight?

595
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,190
What we arguin' for?
I just said the weight.

596
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:10,650
Let's say you lose
because of your weight.

597
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,460
Are they gonna think
you're not as tough as you were?

598
00:45:12,570 --> 00:45:14,300
You're not the same fighter?

599
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,130
Good. They'll match you
with all those guys

600
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,000
they were afraid to match
you with you before.

601
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,240
What happens? You'll kill 'em.
And they gotta give you a title shot.

602
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:24,440
- Bring me coffee, please.
- Why? There's nobody else.

603
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:25,570
Nobody's left.

604
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,740
- Who they gonna give it to?
- Coffee.

605
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:28,820
- In a minute.
- You listenin' to me?

606
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,180
- Please, honey, bring me the coffee.
- All right, just a minute.

607
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,550
- How long I gotta wait?!
- Are you listenin'?

608
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,180
Now let's say you win,
you beat Janiro.

609
00:45:37,290 --> 00:45:39,990
Which you definitely
should beat him, right?

610
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,320
- Yeah.
- Right?

611
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:42,490
- Yeah.
- They still gotta give you

612
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,900
a shot at the title.
You know why?

613
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,520
- Why?
- 'Cause the same thing as before,

614
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,830
there's nobody left,
there ain't nobody around.

615
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:50,300
They gotta give you the shot.

616
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:52,600
Ya understand?
If you win, you win.

617
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,300
If you lose, you still win.

618
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:57,170
There's no way you can lose,
and you do it on your own,

619
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,840
just the way you wanted to do it,
without help from anybody.

620
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:03,440
Ya understand? Just get down
to 155 pounds, ya fat bastard.

621
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:07,180
Stop eatin'. What's the problem?
Stop eatin', that's all, you can do it.

622
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:09,190
You don't understand anything,
do you understand that?

623
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:11,520
Joey's right, this Janiro
is an up-and-coming fighter,

624
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:13,190
he's good-lookin', he's popular.

625
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,260
- You beat him now--
- Excuse me, what do you mean,

626
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,300
- good-lookin'?
- I'm not sayin' good-lookin',

627
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,800
- I'm sayin' popular. If you win--
- But what were you just sayin'

628
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,390
- about good-lookin', popular?
- I'm not sayin' anything.

629
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:24,700
- I'm just tellin' you Joey's right.
- Are you an authority, or what?

630
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:26,600
- Nothin'--
- Get outta here.

631
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:29,730
Get outta here.
Take the baby and get outta here.

632
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:33,340
Everybody all of a sudden's
an authority about this.

633
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,380
Where'd she find out
he's good-lookin', first of all?

634
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,710
She didn't mean nothin'.

635
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,090
Who asked you?

636
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:43,850
You gonna start with me now?

637
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,930
When people are talkin',
you don't interrupt.

638
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:49,660
It's none of your business, especially
if it's my brother and his wife.

639
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,130
Ain't got nothin' to do with you.

640
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,830
Get outta here, go inside.
Take the baby inside.

641
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,270
Come on. Let's leave
the grouches here, okay?

642
00:46:57,370 --> 00:46:59,930
- Come on.
- Change her diapers, can't you see?

643
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:02,810
- She's gonna cry, she stinks.
- You make her cry.

644
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:06,840
- I'm gonna make you cry.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm. Come on.

645
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,020
- They're a couple of babies.
- 155 pounds--

646
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,060
let's go to the training camp.

647
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,460
No distractions,
no wives, no phone calls.

648
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,360
Nobody around to bother you.
I'll write out your usual schedule,

649
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,130
- your usual diet--
- Listen, I wanna ask you somethin'.

650
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:27,130
When I'm away, you ever notice
anything funny goin' on with her?

651
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:28,970
- With who, Vickie?
- Yeah.

652
00:47:29,070 --> 00:47:30,400
Like what?

653
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:32,470
What do you think I mean?

654
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,640
No, I don't notice anything.

655
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,800
I want you to keep
an eye on her, all right?

656
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:39,880
For what, Jack?
She don't do anything wrong.

657
00:47:39,980 --> 00:47:42,780
I want you to keep an eye
on her when I'm away, all right?

658
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:45,820
You just start trouble for nothin',
I'm tellin' ya, you're crackin' up.

659
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,250
I got a reason, right?

660
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,020
You and I both know,
any woman, given the right time,

661
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,990
the right place, the right circumstances,
they'll do anything, right?

662
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,590
I mean, anything's possible.
All right?

663
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:56,930
- You're right.
- You oughta know.

664
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:00,370
You're not wrong, but you're pickin'
on this girl, 'cause I saw you before.

665
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,100
You're worried about your weight,
you're gettin' aggravated,

666
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,770
and you tell her, "What are you--?
Go inside. Who asked ya?"

667
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:08,340
Botherin' her for that, you're gonna
give her an excuse to go out.

668
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,540
- She was talkin' about a guy.
- So?

669
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:13,840
So what? She was talkin'
on your behalf, she wasn't--

670
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:16,920
On my behalf? She was talkin' about
a pretty kid, sayin' he's good-lookin'.

671
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,080
What are you talkin' about?

672
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,880
So you make him ugly,
what's the difference?

673
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:21,250
- That's why?
- Never mind, just do it.

674
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,320
All right.

675
00:48:23,830 --> 00:48:26,790
You know what you should do?
Go inside and be nice to her.

676
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,450
Make up with her.

677
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,660
Tell her you're gonna
take her out, we'll go out.

678
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,530
You wanna go out before
you go away, don't you?

679
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:34,030
This way, you go away
with a clear head.

680
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,130
You know you took her out,

681
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,540
you wined and dined her,
you had a good time.

682
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:38,610
All right?

683
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:41,740
All right.
Where do you wanna go?

684
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,400
- Well, "out" out, you know.
- All right.

685
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,810
Listen, though, if you tell her now,
pull her on the side.

686
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,080
Don't say nothin'
in front of Lenore...

687
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,180
- 'cause I'm not takin' her.
- It's on your head.

688
00:48:52,290 --> 00:48:54,450
- All right.
- We can go without her.

689
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:57,390
- Do what you're gonna do.
- Oh, I am.

690
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,120
Come here.

691
00:49:29,420 --> 00:49:30,390
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

692
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,620
it's great to be back
in the Copa Lounge.

693
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:34,060
What a great audience.

694
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,130
Come on, lady, laugh it up--
I laughed when you come in.

695
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:42,060
But seriously speakin', folks,
we have a special guest with us tonight.

696
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:46,070
I'd like to introduce the world's
leading middleweight contender,

697
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:48,870
the Bronx Bull,
the raging bull.

698
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:52,470
Let's hear it for the great
Jake La Motta, ladies and gentlemen.

699
00:49:58,290 --> 00:49:59,690
What's your name again?

700
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,280
- Janet.
- Janet, sorry, yeah, just been...

701
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,190
It's, uh, toast time.

702
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:11,290
He hits me with a left hook--
no hand, just a hook he had.

703
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:14,830
- Where you goin'?
- Goin' to the bathroom.

704
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:20,640
Hey, Vickie.

705
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:22,400
- Hi.
- Gee, you're lookin' great.

706
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:23,670
- Thanks.
- Joe here?

707
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,250
Yeah, they're over there.
Jake's here, too.

708
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:27,080
That's great.
Listen, I'm over here

709
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,670
with Tommy
and some of the old gang.

710
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:30,270
You get a chance,
come over and have a drink.

711
00:50:30,390 --> 00:50:31,510
See ya later.

712
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:37,250
- Hello, Jake, how are you?
- How you doin'?

713
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:38,920
You're not drinkin', are ya?

714
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:42,690
- Joey, how are ya?
- How you doin', Sal?

715
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,030
Look like you're havin'
a ball over here.

716
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:46,260
I'm over there with Tommy Como.

717
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:47,560
Why don't you come over
and have a drink?

718
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,230
Tommy's here?
I didn't even see him come in.

719
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:51,900
Charlie Rocks,
what are we gonna do here?

720
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:53,670
What you got?
What's the odds?

721
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,610
I'll see you later, Joey.

722
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:02,880
Hey, that's some suit.
He looks good, huh, Jack?

723
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:08,450
I thought that was my best joke.

724
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,500
Rita, Look who's here.

725
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,070
Hi, Vickie.

726
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,300
Hey, Vickie.

727
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:20,710
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How are ya, honey?

728
00:51:20,810 --> 00:51:23,680
Good to see ya.
Say hello to Charlie.

729
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,880
- Sit down, have a drink.
- I can't, I have to get back to Jake.

730
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:29,720
- I just came by to say hello.
- All right, honey, thanks for comin' by.

731
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:33,620
- Not a bad kid, that Vickie, ya know.
- She's with that fuckin' gorilla.

732
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:35,590
She must've caught
a hundred beatin's off that guy.

733
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,430
- What took ya so long?
- I went by Tommy's table to say hello.

734
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,770
I saw you say hello to them all.
But what took ya so long?

735
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:49,700
Nothin', I said hello.
I came back.

736
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,280
- What else did you say?
- He asked me if I wanted a drink.

737
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:56,350
I said, "No, Jake and Joey
are over there," and I left.

738
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:58,540
What were you talkin' to Salvy for?

739
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,480
He asked me if Joey was there,
I said, "He's over there."

740
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:04,710
Then he said, "Tommy's over there,
why don't you go say hello?" And I did.

741
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,550
Are you interested in him?

742
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,650
No, why would I be
interested in him?

743
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,660
You sure you're not interested in him?

744
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,730
Yeah.

745
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,730
In other words, you're not interested
in him, but you could be interested

746
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,200
- in somebody?
- Jake, don't start.

747
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:23,430
What do you gotta--? Hey, shut up,
or I'm gonna smack you in the face.

748
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,240
You embarrass me.

749
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,970
These are from Mr. Como.

750
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:33,050
Shall I take the...?

751
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:35,480
- What?
- Should I take this?

752
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:37,490
- Are you finished?
- I'm not through with it.

753
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:40,150
- Okay.
- These are the jokes, folks.

754
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:44,250
I tell ya the truth, it's so--
Hi, how are ya, you bald-headed fag?

755
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,530
- Hey, Joey.
- Tommy, thanks for the drinks.

756
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,260
- Come on, any time.
- Charlie, how are ya?

757
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:54,130
How you doin', Joey?
How's everything?

758
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,640
- Where's Jake?
- He's over there, he don't wanna come.

759
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,400
- If you call him, he'll come.
- All right.

760
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:06,910
- I'll be right back.
- Here he comes.

761
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:08,920
What is it?
You don't call anybody anymore.

762
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,320
We never see ya anymore.
For cryin' out loud.

763
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:15,920
You never come around anymore?
You can't even make a call? What is it?

764
00:53:16,090 --> 00:53:18,460
I'm busy,
I'm goin' away fightin', I'm busy.

765
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,830
Busy, busy.
Look at him takin' me seriously.

766
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:24,660
I'm only kiddin' you,
what a fuckin' kid.

767
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:27,000
- That's the best fuckin' fighter around.
- Hey, Jake.

768
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:29,070
- How you doin'?
- Them mulignanes.

769
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,640
forget about it,
they're all afraid to fight you.

770
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:33,970
- How you feelin', all right?
- I'm all right.

771
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,810
- Good? Strong?
- Strong, yeah. I'm doin' okay.

772
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:39,180
Then Janiro's gotta
watch his ass, right?

773
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,080
I think he should.

774
00:53:41,550 --> 00:53:43,850
Last three, four times,
I won nothin' but money with the guy.

775
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,010
He's no piece of cake,
that's a good fighter.

776
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,220
Very attractive guy.
All the girls like him.

777
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,350
No marks, clean.

778
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,460
Jake, am I wrong?
Did you gain a few pounds?

779
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,300
A few pounds. I'll knock it off
right away, though, no problem.

780
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,170
Right off, right off.

781
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:05,740
Look, let me ask you somethin'.
I'm just talkin' now, just talkin'.

782
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:09,640
I come to you, and I'm tellin' you
that I'm gonna bet a lot of money on you

783
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:12,110
in this fight with Janiro, right?

784
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,340
Yeah?

785
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:17,320
What would you tell me?
What could you say to me?

786
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,390
I would say
bet everything you got.

787
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,720
- Everything?
- Everything.

788
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:24,490
'Cause I'm gonna
open his hole like this.

789
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,220
Excuse my French, girls.

790
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:30,230
- I'm gonna make him suffer.
- What's wrong with this guy?

791
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,500
I'm gonna make his mother wish
she never had him.

792
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:36,010
- Is this somethin' personal?
- Make him into dog meat. What?

793
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:39,040
- Did he say somethin' in the papers?
- No, he's a nice kid.

794
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:40,700
He's a pretty kid, too.

795
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:43,940
I don't know, I got a problem--
if I should fuck him or fight him.

796
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:49,090
Must be crazy.
Fuck him or fight him.

797
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:52,450
You're really liable to get fucked
with this kid, watch out.

798
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,120
- By who?
- Janiro.

799
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,280
You mean you want me
to get him to fuck you?

800
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:57,420
- Me?
- Yeah.

801
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:00,160
- No, I don't want him to fuck me.
- I could do that easily.

802
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:01,230
How you gonna do that?

803
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,530
I'll get youse both in the ring
and give youse both a fuckin' beatin',

804
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,190
and you both could fuck each other.

805
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,400
- I'll get all full of blood.
- You're used to that.

806
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,780
Come on, drink up.
That's ginger ale, Jake.

807
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,540
- Come on, salute.
- Salute.

808
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,270
- Jake, good luck.
- Salute. Good luck, Jake.

809
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:57,150
Hey, Vick.

810
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:03,390
- What?
- You awake?

811
00:56:04,430 --> 00:56:05,520
No.

812
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,930
- Can you hear me?
- What?

813
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,310
You ever think
of anybody else...

814
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:21,640
when we're in bed?

815
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,240
- What do you mean?
- You know, when we make love.

816
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:28,910
No, nobody, I love you.

817
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:33,090
How come you said
that thing about Janiro?

818
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,490
- What did I say?
- You said he had a pretty face.

819
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,460
I never noticed his face.

820
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,670
How come you said that, then?

821
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:49,000
I don't even know what I said.
I don't even know what he looks like.

822
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,170
Go to sleep.

823
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:11,010
- He ain't pretty no more.
- He really messed him up.

824
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:17,380
And the winner
by unanimous decision

825
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:21,160
in ten rounds,
Jake La Motta!

826
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,290
Give me a little piece of ice,
just a sliver, just for my tongue.

827
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:52,690
- No water!
- Come on, I'm dyin'.

828
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,290
Fuckin' hard-on.

829
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,600
Four pounds.

830
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,700
Keep workin'.
Cut the bullshit.

831
00:59:09,450 --> 00:59:11,510
I saw him fight with Janiro,
I couldn't believe it--

832
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,710
destroyed this guy,
it was absolutely incredible.

833
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:16,120
He knocked his nose from
one side of his face to the other.

834
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,850
- You've gotta be kiddin'.
- Fuckin' thing was hangin' off.

835
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,120
Who you fightin' next?
Can you tell me?

836
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,950
I don't know.
You never know these things--

837
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,790
From all I've seen,
they gotta give him that title shot.

838
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,820
Jackie Curtie, Joey.

839
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:29,260
- You should know each other.
- Hi, Joey.

840
00:59:29,370 --> 00:59:31,270
Pleasure-- heard a lot
of nice things about you.

841
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:32,700
We're gonna get
the title shot, too.

842
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,670
I'm sure. I like your brother.
Made a lot of money on him.

843
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:37,470
Probably more than he did,
that's for sure.

844
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,810
Made some nice cabbage
on the Oscar Jackson fight.

845
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:41,610
Whatever happened to Oscar?

846
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:44,340
- Anybody see him anymore?
- He's punchy, he probably died.

847
00:59:44,450 --> 00:59:45,940
Who the fuck cares?

848
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,350
- Make yourselves comfortable.
- It's a beautiful table.

849
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,150
- The worst table in the house.
- And he's complainin'.

850
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:50,550
It's a beautiful table.

851
00:59:50,650 --> 00:59:52,820
He's workin' downtown,
big building-- workin' an elevator.

852
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,250
Happened to be there the other day.

853
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,790
I'm not Italian, I don't care.

854
00:59:56,890 --> 00:59:58,620
- Took me right up.
- Hey, that Oscar's always

855
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:00,750
a stand-up guy, Joey,
he did you a lot of good.

856
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:02,420
Gave your brother
a hell of a fight, too.

857
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:05,470
Yeah, Mickey?
Cutty Sark and water.

858
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,590
Excuse me one minute, fellas.

859
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,230
- I'll be right back.
- Come back, Joey.

860
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:10,360
Come on back. Okay.

861
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:13,840
- Hey.
- Hey.

862
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,140
Hey, Joe.

863
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:18,610
- Hey, Joey.
- Look at how he's lookin' at us.

864
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,950
- Something's happening.
- She's having a problem.

865
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:24,650
- You're worried about it?
- I'm just sittin' there havin' a drink!

866
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,520
- Shut up. Keep your mouth shut.
- Both of youse are the same.

867
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:27,610
I feel like I'm a prisoner.

868
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:30,720
I can't walk, I look at somebody
the wrong way, I get smacked.

869
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,360
You think you're right or somethin',
the way you're fuckin' yellin'?

870
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,860
- I am right.
- You're wrong.

871
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,690
I am right.
I'm tired of having to turn around

872
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,890
and havin' both of youse
up my ass all the time.

873
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:41,770
- Shut up.
- No.

874
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:43,340
- Don't make me--
- I'm tired of listenin' to you

875
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,500
- and your brother. I'm not wrong.
- Don't make me get nuts in this place.

876
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:47,740
What am I supposed to do?

877
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,040
I'm 20 years old, I gotta go home
and sleep by myself every night?

878
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:51,910
- What the fuck did you marry him for?
- 'Cause I love him.

879
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,680
- You do?
- Yeah, I love him.

880
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:56,750
What am I supposed to do?
This guy don't even wanna fuck me.

881
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,480
He's just been
a contender too long.

882
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:02,720
He'll be all right as soon as he gets
his shot, and then everything'll be okay.

883
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,490
You won't have to go fuckin'
runnin' around when he does.

884
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,960
Jake is never gonna be champ.
Too many people hate him.

885
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:10,590
- And you're drinking with them!
- And I'm gonna finish my drink

886
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:13,500
- and I'm gonna have a good time.
- Get your stuff.

887
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,670
I said you ain't stayin' here.

888
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:20,770
- Get your stuff.
- I'm stayin'.

889
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,850
You're making an asshole
out of my brother, get your stuff.

890
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,170
- Come on, relax.
- Shut up.

891
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,980
Mind your fuckin' business
and shut up.

892
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,680
- You're taking this all wrong.
- I said shut up, didn't I?!

893
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,690
What's the matter with you?
There's nothin' goin' on here.

894
01:01:30,790 --> 01:01:32,920
This is innocent.
We're only having a few drinks.

895
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,450
- Relax, no problem.
- Come on, you know better than that.

896
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:39,930
- All right. Let's all calm down.
- Just relax, come on.

897
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,120
- We've been friends a long time.
- I'm just upset.

898
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:43,830
- It's my brother's wife...
- There's nothing goin' on over here.

899
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:44,920
I'm sorry, I really am.

900
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,330
We're friends,
we can straighten this--

901
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:49,100
Right? Nothing going on?!

902
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,330
Nothing going on?!
Ya dirty cocksucker!

903
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:59,080
- Fuckin' hard-on!
- Get off! Get him off!

904
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:02,350
I'll bite your fuckin' head off,
ya cocksucker!

905
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:05,350
Get outta here, Joey!
What the fuck are you doin'?!

906
01:02:06,090 --> 01:02:08,060
- Easy, easy! Come on!
- Get your hands off me!

907
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,920
- Come on!
- Come on!

908
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,980
Fuckin' cunt.

909
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,310
Get out! Get outta the way!

910
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:18,710
Oh, scumbag!
I'm gonna suck your fuckin' eyes out!

911
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:23,750
Hey, you fuckin'--
what are you, nuts?!

912
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:24,880
Don't mention Tommy.

913
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:27,050
You do what you do,
and we do what we gotta do.

914
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,990
- Don't mention no names.
- No, you're wrong, Joe.

915
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:31,120
He's wrong.
No fuckin' trouble in the joint.

916
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:39,660
I said get outta here,
ya fuckin' mamone!

917
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:42,470
Get back there,
ya fuck, ya!

918
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,170
Take it easy, people.
Come on, now, take it easy.

919
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:49,680
You've had it,
you rat bastard!

920
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:10,290
You guys have
a lot of years between you,

921
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,430
and you've done
a lot of things together.

922
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:15,130
I understand, Joey,
it was your brother's wife.

923
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:16,010
But you don't raise your hands,

924
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:16,840
But you don't raise your hands,

925
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:20,280
you don't create a scene
like that in a place like that.

926
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:23,120
Now, we've heard
everybody's point of view here,

927
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:25,390
and we're gonna forget about it.

928
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:28,950
I shouldn't forget about it,
but we're gonna forget about it.

929
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:30,720
Right?

930
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:32,890
What I want you to do now,
you two guys,

931
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,100
I want you to shake hands,
forget this whole thing,

932
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:37,730
and no grudges.

933
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,640
That's the most important thing--
no grudges.

934
01:03:41,610 --> 01:03:43,410
Now, come on, shake hands.

935
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:50,590
It's all right with me
if it's all right with you.

936
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,810
All right?

937
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:54,850
I only wish this thing
never happened.

938
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:56,790
We all wish it never happened.

939
01:03:56,890 --> 01:04:00,020
Right?
You'll get over it.

940
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:03,260
Salvy, let me talk
with him alone a minute.

941
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:04,490
Yeah, all right.

942
01:04:06,670 --> 01:04:08,970
I'll see you Monday,
Tuesday or somethin', all right?

943
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:11,100
I'm sorry,
I forgot all about it.

944
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:14,440
What are you, fucking nuts?
You're killin' me.

945
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:22,220
Aside from everything else,
is the family all right?

946
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,080
Yeah, they're fine.
Everybody's fine.

947
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:30,880
What is it with you?
You can't talk?

948
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:32,520
- I'm talkin', what do you mean?
- I know.

949
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:35,890
Why have you got this funny attitude?
I can't figure you out.

950
01:04:36,430 --> 01:04:40,060
What is it with all the quick answers?
"Yeah, they're all right. Yeah."

951
01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:43,330
You wanna get outta here
fast or something?

952
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:44,800
No, it's nothin' like that.

953
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:47,810
It's just all the aggravation
and everything and...

954
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:49,840
all the fights and all.

955
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:54,050
Listen to me.
Now, Jake...

956
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:57,580
the guy's become
an embarrassment.

957
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:01,420
He's embarrassin' me
with certain people,

958
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,790
and I'm lookin' very bad.

959
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,760
I can't deliver a kid from
my own goddamn neighborhood.

960
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,360
What is it with him?

961
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:12,430
Why does he have to make it
so hard on himself?

962
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:15,160
He comes to me,
I make it easier for him.

963
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,270
The man's got a head of rock.

964
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:27,710
You know, it's hard
to explain, Tommy, he's...

965
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:29,710
Jack respects you.

966
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:32,290
I mean, he don't even
say hello to anybody.

967
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:34,690
You he talks to, he likes you.

968
01:05:36,190 --> 01:05:38,790
It's just that when he gets
somethin' on his mind,

969
01:05:38,890 --> 01:05:41,890
he's got a hard head,
he likes to do things his own way.

970
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:44,360
Jesus Christ could
come off the cross sometimes,

971
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:46,900
he don't give a fuck,
he's gonna do what he wants to do,

972
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:50,030
he wants to make it on his own.
He thinks he can make it on his own.

973
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:51,440
Make it on his own.

974
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:56,600
He thinks he's gonna walk in there
and become champion on his own?

975
01:05:57,350 --> 01:06:00,180
- He's crazy. You know he's nuts.
- Yeah, he's crazy.

976
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:03,680
And he's got no respect for nobody,
he doesn't listen to nobody.

977
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,080
That's not crazy.

978
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:08,590
- He respects you, though.
- He doesn't respect anybody.

979
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,820
Now, you do this for me,
you understand?

980
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:16,130
You tell him I don't care
how colorful he is, how great he is.

981
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:17,860
He could beat all
the Sugar Ray Robinsons

982
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:19,990
and the Tony Janiros in the world.

983
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:23,660
But he ain't gonna get a shot
at that title, not without us, he ain't.

984
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:26,600
Now, you're a smart kid.

985
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,100
You go to him, you tell him...

986
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,550
Son of a bitch.

987
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:38,210
Twenty dollar shoe here.

988
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:47,400
Aren't you gonna
ask me what happened?

989
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:52,730
What's the matter?

990
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,070
- What's wrong?
- I remember when I met her here.

991
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,230
- Who?
- Vickie.

992
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:07,250
Why, what's the matter?
What'd she do now?

993
01:07:10,590 --> 01:07:13,520
I know she's doin' somethin',
I just wanna catch her once.

994
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:14,750
Just once.

995
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,330
Hey, Jack.
Wanna do yourself a favor?

996
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:24,090
Bust her fuckin' hole,
throw her out.

997
01:07:24,630 --> 01:07:27,190
Either that, or live with her
and let her ruin your life,

998
01:07:27,300 --> 01:07:29,100
'cause that's what's happenin'.

999
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:34,880
How much could you take?
How much shit could you take?

1000
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,310
So, what'd that guy say?

1001
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:49,880
He gave me the old
"good news, bad news" routine.

1002
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:51,480
The good news is

1003
01:07:51,590 --> 01:07:53,720
you're gonna get
the shot at the title.

1004
01:07:53,830 --> 01:07:58,060
The bad news is they want you
to do the old flip-flop for them.

1005
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:01,160
- So, what else is new?
- What'd you expect?

1006
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:02,700
You didn't know that was comin'?

1007
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,430
You win some,
you lose some.

1008
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,010
This one, we're losin'.

1009
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,470
Billy Fox.

1010
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:14,810
173 and 3/4 pounds.

1011
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:21,690
- Jake La Motta. 167...
- I guess you've heard by now

1012
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:25,060
a lot of the stuff that's
goin' around, a lot of rumors.

1013
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:28,890
Matter of fact, a short time ago
you were a big favorite,

1014
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:31,360
and all of a sudden,
you're a 12-5 underdog,

1015
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:33,460
and people are talkin',
it's as simple as that.

1016
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:36,370
- That's funny, I never heard anything.
- It's out there, though,

1017
01:08:36,470 --> 01:08:37,530
and It's not good.

1018
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:39,610
As a matter of fact,
the bets are off on this one.

1019
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:41,540
Nothin' goin' in this one.

1020
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:45,480
Matter of fact, smart money is sayin'
that you're getting ready to hit the tank.

1021
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,780
- That's bullshit.
- Yeah, that's bullshit.

1022
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:50,050
You got any money
you wanna bet?

1023
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:51,710
- Come on.
- I'll take the action, go ahead.

1024
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:54,620
You bet it on Fox,
'cause I'm gonna win.

1025
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,060
There's no way I'm goin' down.
I don't go down for nobody.

1026
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:58,960
- That's what I wanted to hear.
- I want you to know that.

1027
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:00,530
- All right.
- All right, Colonel.

1028
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:02,120
Okay, that's it.

1029
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:03,560
You came down here just
for that nonsense?

1030
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:05,360
- That was it?
- That was it.

1031
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,400
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1032
01:09:17,510 --> 01:09:20,420
Welcome to
the Madison Square Garden

1033
01:09:20,530 --> 01:09:22,620
feature attraction.

1034
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:27,290
- In this corner, weighing 175 pounds...
- Commissioner, how about a picture?

1035
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,200
Fellas, can we get
a picture over here?

1036
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:33,100
...the undefeated Billy Fox.

1037
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:38,970
Hi, Steve. Your brother
got out of the hospital?

1038
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:42,070
- They think it's all right.
- Did he get out? Good.

1039
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,350
- Charlie, let me sit over there.
- Yeah, sure.

1040
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,450
Tommy, what's the matter?
Everything's all right?

1041
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:51,990
It's all right, yeah.

1042
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,750
Touch gloves now,
come out boxing.

1043
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:55,660
Five seconds, Alex.

1044
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,970
Come on, stand--
come on, stand up!

1045
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:13,770
What the fuck you doin'?
Hit me, ya fuckin' bum, come on.

1046
01:10:14,450 --> 01:10:15,570
Come on.

1047
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:19,620
What are you doin', Jake?!
Come on, box him!

1048
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,260
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

1049
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,860
What do you think
you're doin' out there?!

1050
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:35,260
- Huh?
- Little slow, that's all.

1051
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:37,930
- What are you doin' out there?
- Take it easy, he'll be all right.

1052
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:41,200
He's a little slow. He'll make it up,
what are ya worried about?

1053
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:44,870
Goddamn it. Come on,
pick it up a little, Jake, I'm sorry.

1054
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:47,210
Come on, Jake,
I got some money on ya!

1055
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,970
- Tank job!
- Hit him back, ya bum!

1056
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,380
- Come on.
- Hit him back!

1057
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,250
You fuckin' bum!
You're takin' a dive in the fourth?

1058
01:10:55,790 --> 01:10:57,880
Pocket your dirty money!

1059
01:11:00,430 --> 01:11:03,050
Aw, you phony bastard!
That's a fix!

1060
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,720
We're stoppin' the fight!

1061
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,600
What the fuck are you waitin' for
to stop the fight, ya jerk?!

1062
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,230
And you standin' there.

1063
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:13,330
- Fuckin' go down, will ya?
- The referee stops this bout

1064
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:18,140
at 2:23 of the fourth round.

1065
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,640
The winner
by technical knockout,

1066
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,910
and still undefeated,

1067
01:11:24,020 --> 01:11:27,010
Billy Fox!

1068
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,250
What'd I do?!

1069
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:43,530
Don't fight anymore.

1070
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:46,430
It's a free country,
don't fight anymore.

1071
01:11:47,810 --> 01:11:51,610
Aw, what'd I do?
What'd I do?

1072
01:11:55,980 --> 01:11:58,140
What'd I do?

1073
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,120
- Get outta here!
- Jake has an interview--

1074
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:12,130
It's all right, Jake.
It's all right.

1075
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:16,630
Why did I do it? Why?

1076
01:12:22,240 --> 01:12:24,540
They got some balls,
some balls.

1077
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,900
I take the dive.
What more do they want?

1078
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:30,000
They want me
to go down, too?

1079
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,580
I ain't goin' down.
I ain't goin' down for nobody.

1080
01:12:32,680 --> 01:12:35,310
Why don't you do me a favor?
Just put your hands up.

1081
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:37,720
I wanna show you somethin'.
Put your hands up.

1082
01:12:38,960 --> 01:12:42,760
- What the fuck is so hard about that?
- Hey, you don't understand.

1083
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:46,420
I had to fight a bum.
He's a bum.

1084
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:49,430
I fought the guy, I tapped him like that,
all of a sudden he's like this

1085
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:51,160
all over the place,
what am I gonna do?

1086
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:53,360
You don't have to fuckin'
pick him up and help him.

1087
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:55,170
What am I gonna do?
If I don't pick him up,

1088
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:57,500
then what am I gonna do?
I'm gonna be in worse trouble.

1089
01:12:58,310 --> 01:12:59,830
I don't know.

1090
01:12:59,950 --> 01:13:02,970
"Purse was withheld--" look at this--
"Purse was withheld pending

1091
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:05,140
D.A.'s probe."
Look at that.

1092
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:07,840
Look how they make me look.

1093
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:09,980
Like a bum,
like a mammalucco.

1094
01:13:10,660 --> 01:13:11,620
A what?

1095
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,990
Like the mammalucco of the year.

1096
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:15,720
Tommy ain't gonna forget us.

1097
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,120
You're gonna get your shot,
as long as he don't die.

1098
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,320
- As long as who don't die?
- Tommy.

1099
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:23,990
What are you talkin' about?

1100
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:26,000
In other words,
Tommy ain't gonna forget ya,

1101
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,330
you're gonna get your shot
if he don't die.

1102
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:29,500
- Gotta make sure the guy stays alive.
- He got a disease or somethin'?

1103
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,510
No, I'm just sayin',
I'm kiddin', like.

1104
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:33,370
What's wrong with him?
Is somethin' wrong with him?

1105
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,410
There ain't nothin' wrong with him,
that's the only way you wouldn't get it

1106
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:38,410
- is if he dies, he won't be able to--
- What are you talkin' like that for?

1107
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:48,680
What do you want me to do?
It's an outdoor arena.

1108
01:13:48,790 --> 01:13:51,590
What do you wanna do,
fight in the rain? It's a stadium.

1109
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:53,290
You waited this long,
you can wait longer.

1110
01:13:53,970 --> 01:13:56,430
You wanna wait 24 hours?
I don't wanna wait no 24 hours.

1111
01:13:56,530 --> 01:13:59,590
I don't either, but we gotta,
so we'll wait. Hello?

1112
01:14:00,310 --> 01:14:03,370
- You guys wanna stop now?
- Get off the phone with them.

1113
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,030
Why do you give them
the satisfaction?

1114
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:07,440
- Get off the phone with them!
- He don't wanna talk to nobody.

1115
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:09,710
How many times do we have
to tell ya? You hear him yellin'?

1116
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:12,370
There's enough confusion up here.
Please, don't call.

1117
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:15,780
No comment. Right.
Thank you. Bye!

1118
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:17,880
Pains in the asses,
I don't believe them.

1119
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:20,620
Why do you give them the satisfaction?
Why don't you just hang up on 'em?

1120
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:22,630
- That's all.
- I'm gonna get somethin' to eat.

1121
01:14:22,730 --> 01:14:24,850
- What do you want to eat?
- I don't want nothin'.

1122
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:26,520
I don't want nothin'.

1123
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,600
Eat somethin',
you gotta eat somethin'.

1124
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:33,240
You can't go without eatin'.
Eat a steak.

1125
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,240
You chew it, you spit it out,
you'll still make the weight tomorrow.

1126
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,370
You're worried about that?

1127
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,910
I'll order a steak.
At least if you want it, it's here.

1128
01:14:43,010 --> 01:14:44,910
You don't want it,
do whatever you want with it.

1129
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:47,450
- Go ahead.
- Vickie, what do you want?

1130
01:14:48,190 --> 01:14:50,020
Order me a piece of cake.

1131
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:52,020
That's all you want
is a piece of cake?

1132
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,750
Why don't you get a cheeseburger,
French fries? It's better for you.

1133
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:57,850
- It's like a whole meal.
- Yeah, that's good.

1134
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,430
That's good,
order me one of those.

1135
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:01,470
Wait a minute,
what do you want to eat?

1136
01:15:01,570 --> 01:15:03,800
Since when did you
order one of those?

1137
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:06,300
- That's what I want.
- It's a free country.

1138
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,530
You order what you want.
Don't let nobody influence you.

1139
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:10,770
I'm not tellin' her what to eat,
I was just suggesting.

1140
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,810
What are you tellin' her
what to ask for?

1141
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:16,040
I'm not tellin' her-- personally,
I don't give a fuck what she eats.

1142
01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:18,780
What were you tellin' her that for?

1143
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,780
Order me a cheeseburger.

1144
01:15:23,770 --> 01:15:26,360
Just order her
a cheeseburger, that's all.

1145
01:15:27,570 --> 01:15:28,800
What the f--?

1146
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:32,000
What are you guys doin' so long?
How long does this thing take to do?

1147
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:33,070
Forty seconds.

1148
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:35,730
Forty seconds is no good.
You gotta do it in 30 seconds.

1149
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,970
If we gotta stitch him up,
that's how much time.

1150
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:43,580
Ya up?

1151
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:46,590
- What?
- Somebody's here to see ya.

1152
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:49,090
- Hey, Jack.
- Hey, Tommy, how you doin'?

1153
01:15:49,190 --> 01:15:50,490
How are you?

1154
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:57,930
Say hello to Charlie. Charlie!

1155
01:15:58,030 --> 01:16:00,660
- Jake, how are ya? Lots of luck.
- Hello, Charlie, good to see you.

1156
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,500
Thank you.

1157
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:06,570
- How you feeling?
- I'm feelin' all right, thank you.

1158
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:09,770
- Are you feeling good?
- I feel as good as I'm gonna feel.

1159
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,350
I gotta get in there and fight,
then I'll know how I'm gonna feel.

1160
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:15,540
All right. We just come by
to wish you luck and all that.

1161
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:17,120
- Thanks.
- You need anything?

1162
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:18,580
- No.
- You sure, nothing?

1163
01:16:18,690 --> 01:16:19,650
No, thank you, Tommy.

1164
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:21,810
All right.
Take care, good luck.

1165
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,620
- God bless ya.
- All right, thank you.

1166
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:26,020
- You'll be all right.
- Yeah, I'll be all right.

1167
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:28,090
See you later, everybody.

1168
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,060
- Vickie, good-bye.
- Tommy, wait.

1169
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:32,630
We really appreciate your comin',
I want you to know that.

1170
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:34,900
It was really nice of you.
I appreciate it.

1171
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,870
- Come on, Joey, anytime.
- A time like this is very important to him.

1172
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:40,270
- Anytime.
- I just wanted to say good-bye.

1173
01:16:40,380 --> 01:16:43,210
So long, honey. I want you
to take good care of that guy, all right?

1174
01:16:43,310 --> 01:16:45,580
- I'll take care of him.
- Joey, any little thing,

1175
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:48,410
I want you to call me.
He's very nervous. Ba-boom, call.

1176
01:16:48,520 --> 01:16:49,510
Good-bye, honey.

1177
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:53,150
Would you look at that face?
What a face.

1178
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:54,920
Can you believe that girl?

1179
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:57,360
Look at that beauty.
Just as beautiful as ever.

1180
01:16:57,460 --> 01:16:59,650
- The least little thing, all right?
- Bye-bye, Tommy.

1181
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,220
- So long, everybody.
- So long, Tommy.

1182
01:17:12,810 --> 01:17:14,600
Hey! Come here.

1183
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,670
Come here a minute.

1184
01:17:24,090 --> 01:17:25,710
What was all that about?

1185
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,450
All what?

1186
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,320
You know what I'm talkin' about.
What was that all about?

1187
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:34,060
- With him.
- Nothin', I just said good-bye.

1188
01:17:34,160 --> 01:17:36,260
All of a sudden you're
so friendly with him?

1189
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:38,060
- I just said good-bye.
- You don't do that.

1190
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:40,530
You say hello, you say good-bye,
that's all, ya hear?

1191
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,100
- I hear.
- Hey!

01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:45,330
You hear what I said? You don't ever
have any disrespect for me.

1193
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:47,070
You hear what I said?

1194
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,440
- Yeah, I hear.

1195
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:54,320
- Come here.
- Why don't you stop that?

1196
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:56,040
Shut up, you! Shut up!

1197
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:58,580
Shut up! I'll fuckin'

1198
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:59,810
Shut up!

1199
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:10,700
Disgusted with the two of youse.

1217
01:21:08,640 --> 01:21:11,440
Hey, Commissioner? Come on in,

1227
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,410
It's the worst thing you could do.

1228
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:19,120
Oh, you're home.

1229
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:22,560

1231
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:30,730
I went out.
What's the matter?

1232
01:22:30,840 --> 01:22:32,300
Television won't work.

1233
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:34,660
Where'd you go?

1234
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:39,070
Went out, went shoppin'.
Went to my sister's. You know.

1235
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:53,980
What's the matter with you?
What's with this kissin' on the mouth?

1236
01:22:54,090 --> 01:22:56,150
I just said hello.
Can't I kiss my sister-in-law?

1237
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:57,780
Isn't the cheek
good enough for you?

1238
01:22:57,900 --> 01:22:58,860
Come on, huh?

1239
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:00,520
I don't even kiss Mom on the mouth
the way you kiss her.

1240
01:23:00,630 --> 01:23:02,220
All of a sudden,
you're like a Romeo.

1241
01:23:02,330 --> 01:23:04,270
You're not supposed to kiss
your mother on the mouth.

1242
01:23:04,370 --> 01:23:06,000
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1243
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:13,240
- How's that?
- That looks like somethin'.

1244
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:20,380
Get back, I can't see nothin'
with your stomach in the way.

1245
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:23,580
What are you
givin' me dirty looks for?

1246
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:29,220
Supposed to be a champion,
ya eat like there's no tomorrow.

1247
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:31,120
That's it, go ahead--
forget how long it took you

1248
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:33,320
to get to the title,
all the years, the hard work.

1249
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:36,160
You forgot. You're gonna
defend it next month, keep eatin'.

1250
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:39,560
Give me dirty looks like
I don't know what I'm talkin' about?

1251
01:23:43,110 --> 01:23:45,740
What happened with you
and Salvy at the Copa that time?

1252
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,840
- When?
- When you gave him a beatin'.

1253
01:23:49,610 --> 01:23:51,780
You mean when I caught
his head in the taxicab door,

1254
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:54,110
and was bangin' it,
smacked him with a glass?

1255
01:23:54,220 --> 01:23:56,150
- Yeah.
- I told you about that.

1256
01:23:56,790 --> 01:23:58,250
- Didn't I?
- No.

1257
01:23:58,360 --> 01:24:00,760
- I never told you?
- No, you never told me.

1258
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,190
It was no big thing, anyway.

1259
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:05,090
I smacked him in the mouth,
he was drunk, he started some shit.

1260
01:24:05,200 --> 01:24:07,390
Had to go downtown,
straighten it all out with Tommy.

1261
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,490
It's all forgotten about,
supposedly, anyway.

1262
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,690
How come you
never told me about it?

1263
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,030
It didn't have anything
to do with you.

1264
01:24:15,640 --> 01:24:17,510
- Had nothin' to do with me?
- No.

1265
01:24:17,610 --> 01:24:21,340
Who'd it have somethin'
to do with-- Vickie?

1266
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:24,880
I just explained
the whole thing to you, didn't I?

1267
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:26,970
- Yeah.
- It was between me and Salvy.

1268
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:30,490
If it had anything to do with you
and Vickie, I woulda told you about it.

1269
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:35,390
That's not what I heard, Joe.

1270
01:24:35,490 --> 01:24:36,980
What do you mean,
that's not what you heard?

1271
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:39,060
- That's not what I heard.
- What'd you hear?

1272
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:40,720
I heard some things.

1273
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:44,030
- You heard about me and Salvy--
- I heard things, Joey.

1274
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:46,660
You heard that I cracked Salvy
all around, what'd you hear?

1275
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:48,670
- I heard things.
- What things you heard?

1276
01:24:48,770 --> 01:24:49,870
I heard some things.

1277
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:52,470
You heard things. You wanna worry?
Don't start that shit.

1278
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:54,010
You know what
you should worry about?

1279
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:57,170
Worry you got this title fight next month.
That's what you should worry about.

1280
01:24:58,080 --> 01:24:59,210
Do that.

1281
01:25:02,990 --> 01:25:04,110
Christ!

1282
01:25:08,990 --> 01:25:11,390
- Did Salvy fuck Vickie?
- What?

1283
01:25:11,500 --> 01:25:13,090
Did Salvy fuck Vickie?

1284
01:25:15,030 --> 01:25:17,470
Hey, Jack,
don't start your shit.

1285
01:25:17,570 --> 01:25:19,540
- No, really, don't start.
- Joey, I asked ya.

1286
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,700
- Didn't I ask ya to keep an eye on her?
- And I did keep an eye on her.

1287
01:25:22,810 --> 01:25:24,240
Then how come ya
gave him a beatin'?

1288
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:26,640
I told you that.
I told you what that was all about.

1289
01:25:26,740 --> 01:25:28,370
Didn't have nothin' to do with you.

1290
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:31,410
- He thinks he's a wiseguy--
- Joey, don't lie to me.

1291
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,540
- I'm not lyin'.
- What do I look like to you?

1292
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:35,210
Hey, I'm your brother.

1293
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:37,380
You're supposed to believe me.
Don't you trust me?

1294
01:25:37,490 --> 01:25:38,980
- No, I don't.
- You don't? That's nice.

1295
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:42,030
I don't trust you when it comes to her.
I don't trust nobody.

1296
01:25:43,030 --> 01:25:47,230
- Tell me what happened.
- I told you exactly what happened.

1297
01:25:47,330 --> 01:25:49,770
He got out of line,
I slapped him around.

1298
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:52,630
Tommy straightened it all out,
and it's all over.

1299
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:00,440
You give me
that look, Joey.

1300
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:06,110
I gotta accept
your answer, you know?

1301
01:26:06,220 --> 01:26:08,190
But I'm tellin' ya now,
if I hear anything,

1302
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:10,950
I swear on our mother,
I'm gonna kill somebody.

1303
01:26:11,960 --> 01:26:15,320
- I'm gonna kill somebody.
- Well, go ahead and kill everybody!

1304
01:26:15,430 --> 01:26:16,860
You're the tough guy,
go kill people.

1305
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,260
Kill Vickie, kill Salvy,
kill Tommy Como,

1306
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:21,230
kill me, while you're at it,
what do I care?

1307
01:26:21,330 --> 01:26:24,170
You're killin' yourself,
the way you eat, ya fat fuck!

1308
01:26:24,270 --> 01:26:26,170
- Look at ya!
- What do you mean?

1309
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:28,170
I don't understand,
what do you mean, kill you?

1310
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:32,370
Me, kill me! Start here!
Kill me first, do me a fuckin' favor!

1311
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,500
'Cause you're drivin' me crazy!

1312
01:26:34,610 --> 01:26:37,550
You're a killer, you're a big shot.
Just kill, you're a killer.

1313
01:26:37,650 --> 01:26:39,880
Excuse me,
what do you mean by you, though?

1314
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:42,820
So? What does that mean?
Don't mean nothin'.

1315
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:45,350
Even you don't know
what you meant by you.

1316
01:26:45,460 --> 01:26:47,980
- Don't mean nothin'.
- Joey, that meant somethin'.

1317
01:26:48,090 --> 01:26:50,490
You mentioned Tommy, Salvy,
you mentioned you--

1318
01:26:50,590 --> 01:26:52,030
you included you with them.

1319
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,560
You coulda said anybody,
but you said you and them.

1320
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:59,070
You really let this girl
ruin your life, look at ya.

1321
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:02,070
She really did some job on ya,
ya know how fuckin' nuts you are?

1322
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:04,700
- Look what she did to you!
- You fuck my wife?

1323
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:06,780
- What?!
- You fuck my wife?

1324
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:12,210
How could you ask me
a question like that?

1325
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:14,220
How could you ask me?
I'm your brother.

1326
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,290
You ask me that?

1327
01:27:17,150 --> 01:27:19,950
Where do you get your balls
big enough to ask me that?

1328
01:27:23,730 --> 01:27:25,020
Just tell me.

1329
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:31,740
I'm not answerin' that.

1330
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:34,010
I'm not gonna answer that,
it's stupid.

1331
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:39,810
You're very smart, Joey.

1332
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:45,390
You're givin' me all these answers,
but you ain't givin' me the right answer.

1333
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:49,850
I'm gonna ask ya again.

1334
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,360
Did you or did you not?

1335
01:27:55,540 --> 01:27:56,970
I'm not gonna answer.

1336
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:59,010
That's a sick question,
you're a sick fuck,

1337
01:27:59,110 --> 01:28:01,170
and I'm not that sick
that I'm gonna answer it.

1338
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,570
I'm not tellin' ya anything.
I'm gonna leave.

1339
01:28:03,680 --> 01:28:06,650
If Lenore calls, tell her I went home.
I'm not stayin' in this nuthouse with ya.

1340
01:28:06,750 --> 01:28:08,870
You're a sick bastard--
I feel sorry for ya, I really do.

1341
01:28:08,980 --> 01:28:10,040
You know what you should do?

1342
01:28:10,150 --> 01:28:12,740
Try a little more fuckin'
and a little less eatin'.

1343
01:28:12,850 --> 01:28:15,010
You won't have troubles
upstairs in your bedroom,

1344
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:17,250
and you won't pick it out
on me and everybody else.

1345
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,450
Ya understand, ya fuckin' wacko?
You're crackin' up.

1346
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,260
Fuckin' screwball, ya.

1347
01:29:07,780 --> 01:29:09,400
Where were ya?

1348
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:10,880
I was at my sister's.

1349
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,640
Where'd you go after that?

1350
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:16,710
- To the movies.
- Yeah, what'd you see?

1351
01:29:18,790 --> 01:29:20,380
Father of the Bride.

1352
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:28,760
How come you didn't
tell me about the Copa?

1353
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:33,770
- Tell you what about it?
- You know.

1354
01:29:34,470 --> 01:29:36,490
How come you didn't
tell me about it?

1355
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:39,870
Why didn't you tell
me about it, huh?

1356
01:29:39,970 --> 01:29:41,940
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1357
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:46,310
Why didn't you tell me?
Did you fuck my brother?

1358
01:29:46,410 --> 01:29:48,850
- Get off me, you fat pig!
- Did you? Did you?

1359
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:50,250
- Huh?
- No!

1360
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,180
Open the door.

1361
01:29:58,290 --> 01:29:59,920
- Get away!
- Come on, open the door.

1362
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:02,430
- I wanna talk to you.
- Get away from me, you're sick!

1363
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:05,090
I just wanna ask you one thing.
Why'd you fuck Joey?

1364
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,500
- Get away!
- Open the door.

1365
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:07,730
No.

1366
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:13,300
Why'd you do it?
Why'd you do it, huh?

1367
01:30:13,740 --> 01:30:15,070
I didn't do anything!

1368
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:20,250
- Why did you fuck them?
- Do what? I didn't do anything?!

1369
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:21,340
I fucked all of 'em!

1370
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,580
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you mean, who'd you fuck?

1371
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:26,240
I fucked all of 'em-- Tommy,
Salvy, your brother, all of 'em!

1372
01:30:26,350 --> 01:30:29,020
I sucked your brother's cock!
What do you want me to say?!

1373
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:31,920
- You sucked his cock?
- I sucked his cock,

1374
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:33,860
and everybody else on
the fuckin' street.

1375
01:30:33,960 --> 01:30:37,020
What do you want? You're nothin'
but a fat pig, selfish fool!

1376
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:40,100
Forget fuckin' with you!

1377
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:47,900
His fuckin' cock's
bigger than yours, too!

1378
01:30:49,310 --> 01:30:50,970
Where you goin'?

1379
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:53,640
Where are you goin',
you bastard?

1380
01:30:53,750 --> 01:30:55,610
You sick animal!
Where you goin'?

1381
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:59,620
Let me go! Get off of me,
ya piece of shit!

1382
01:30:59,720 --> 01:31:02,210
If I see you put your hands
in that plate one more time,

1383
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:04,220
I'm gonna stab you
with this knife, ya hear me?

1384
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,950
I told ya, keep your hands
outta the plate!

1385
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:11,100
Why can't we eat in peace
around here? Just relax.

1386
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:13,130
Do I have to eat like you?
Like a gavone, like--

1387
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:16,460
Jack! Jack!
What's the matter with you?!

1388
01:31:16,570 --> 01:31:18,000
Ya fucked my wife, huh?!

1389
01:31:21,940 --> 01:31:23,140
Get off of him!

1390
01:31:25,850 --> 01:31:29,510
- I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya!
- Stop it, he didn't do it!

1391
01:31:31,950 --> 01:31:33,680
Call the police!

1392
01:31:36,260 --> 01:31:37,720
I'll fuckin' kill ya!

1393
01:31:39,930 --> 01:31:41,050
Get out!

1394
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:37,110
Don't leave, honey, please.

1395
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:13,350
Honey, look-- I'm a bum without
you and the kids, don't go.

1396
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:32,570
Just...

1397
01:33:53,740 --> 01:33:56,300
Less than a minute to go,
and La Motta is losing the title

1398
01:33:56,410 --> 01:33:58,640
that he won from
the gallant Marcel Cerdan.

1399
01:33:58,740 --> 01:34:01,640
After the tragic plane crash
that took Cerdan's life.

1400
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:04,650
Laurent Dauthuille vowed
to bring the title back to France.

1401
01:34:04,750 --> 01:34:07,650
Tonight, he only has to last
this fifteenth round

1402
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:10,380
to be crowned the new
Middleweight Champion.

1403
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:14,520
La Motta is taking terrible punishment
on the ropes as Dauthuille bangs him

1404
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:18,030
with lefts and rights to the head.
Another left, another right to the jaw.

1405
01:34:18,130 --> 01:34:20,620
La Motta turns around,
he's been playing possum!

1406
01:34:20,730 --> 01:34:23,390
He's got Dauthuille hurt!
He rips a right hand to the body,

1407
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,260
two left hooks to the jaw,
another left and a right to the head!

1408
01:34:26,370 --> 01:34:28,670
Dauthuille is reeling around the ring!

1409
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:31,040
The tide has turned,
no question about it!

1410
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:37,910
And he wobbles into the ropes
and goes down!

1411
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:41,250
Dauthuille is down,
and referee Lou Handler comes over

1412
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:44,410
and starts the count.
He's trying to get up.

1413
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,220
Six... seven...

1414
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:49,820
He'll never make it.
Nine... ten!

1415
01:34:49,930 --> 01:34:50,950
You're out!

1416
01:34:51,060 --> 01:34:52,390
It is all over!

1417
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,620
He is knocked out,
and Jake La Motta,

1418
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:57,430
with 13 seconds left to go
in the final round,

1419
01:34:57,530 --> 01:35:00,000
has made one of the most
remarkable comebacks

1420
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:02,770
- in all boxing history.
- Jake La Motta!

1421
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:09,100
Come on.

1422
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:12,110
Just tell him you're sorry,
you miss him.

1423
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:20,280
He's your brother, you have to
talk to him sooner or later.

1424
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:30,160
I'll dial him for you,
then you talk to him.

1425
01:35:30,270 --> 01:35:33,130
Just tell him you're sorry,
then you can say whatever you want.

1426
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:47,580
Go ahead.

1427
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,930
Hey, champ-- like to ask
you a few questions.

1428
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:03,430
- Not now.
- I been waitin' an hour for you.

1429
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:06,160
- Excuse me, my wife is--
- There's a great angle here...

1430
01:36:06,270 --> 01:36:08,930
Don't bother me, please.
Get outta here.

1431
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,270
Come on. All right, champ?

1432
01:36:10,370 --> 01:36:13,100
- You're a great guy.
- I asked you nice, will ya--?

1433
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:25,210
Hello?

1434
01:36:31,930 --> 01:36:34,730
Salvy, this ain't
funny anymore.

1435
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:35,890
Is that you?

1436
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,900
I know somebody's there.
I can hear you breathin'.

1437
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:40,730
You listenin'?

1438
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:45,640
Your mother sucks
fuckin' big fuckin' elephant dicks.

1439
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:47,210
You got that?

1440
01:37:35,830 --> 01:37:37,380
The fight of the year.

1441
01:37:37,490 --> 01:37:40,760
The next time that friendly bartender
says, "What'll you have?"

1442
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:43,830
give him that answer the whole world
gives, "Pabst Blue Ribbon."

1443
01:37:47,270 --> 01:37:50,170
Those punches by La Motta
explain themselves.

1444
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:53,500
They fought five times
between 1942 and 1945.

1445
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:58,450
It has so far been a blazing bout
for the Middleweight Championship.

1446
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:02,480
In that great action by La Motta,
he couldn't score the big one.

1447
01:38:02,590 --> 01:38:04,710
That's it,
that was his last shot.

1448
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,820
Round number 13,
the hard-luck number.

1449
01:38:09,930 --> 01:38:11,520
There's the buzzer,

1450
01:38:11,630 --> 01:38:13,620
and I think you know
both the boys.

1451
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:26,800
Robinson hurting La Motta,
he's hurting him now.

1452
01:38:29,810 --> 01:38:32,810
He has La Motta
on queer street, holding on.

1453
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,180
Certainly, that was one
of the most damaging evidences

1454
01:38:36,290 --> 01:38:39,120
of punching that
you have seen in recent years.

1455
01:38:39,220 --> 01:38:40,950
Come on! Come on.

1456
01:38:46,260 --> 01:38:49,890
- What are you standin' there for?
- Robinson, apparently tired,

1457
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,900
punched with a "fare thee well,"
and rocked Jake La Motta

1458
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,660
- right to his heels.
- Come on, Ray, come on!

1459
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,450
These are clean, whistling shots.

1460
01:40:03,550 --> 01:40:06,250
How he can survive them,
nobody knows.

1461
01:40:06,350 --> 01:40:08,580
No man can endure this pummeling!

1462
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:11,450
The fight is stopped on...

1463
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,290
the signal to Frankie Sikora.

1464
01:40:14,430 --> 01:40:17,360
Row after row after row
from the ring,

1465
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:18,990
the crowd is standing and cheering,

1466
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:22,130
as he just cannonaded
Jake La Motta

1467
01:40:22,240 --> 01:40:25,260
- into a death defeat.
- Hey, Ray.

1468
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:28,470
And when I say that, I mean
Jake wouldn't want to quit.

1469
01:40:28,580 --> 01:40:30,700
- He wanted to go.
- Hey, Ray.

1470
01:40:32,310 --> 01:40:33,840
Never went down, Ray.

1471
01:40:34,980 --> 01:40:36,950
You never got me down, Ray.

1472
01:40:37,820 --> 01:40:38,940
Ya hear me?

1473
01:40:39,620 --> 01:40:41,640
Never got me down.

1474
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,190
Yeah? See, look?

1475
01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:46,990
And in the thirteenth round,
the hard-luck round,

1476
01:40:47,090 --> 01:40:49,960
the championship of the world
has changed hands.

1477
01:40:50,830 --> 01:40:51,850
And there you see it...

1478
01:40:52,670 --> 01:40:55,130
a champion gone down to defeat.

1479
01:40:55,940 --> 01:40:58,270
And so, now we wait
for the announcement

1480
01:40:58,370 --> 01:41:02,310
from Eddie Flint,
the ring announcer.

1481
01:41:03,010 --> 01:41:05,440
Then we'll get up in the ring,
join with the radio audience

1482
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:06,980
throughout the world,

1483
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:09,640
and have a brief interview
with Ray Robinson.

1484
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:13,340
Now we're waiting for the time
to be announced.

1485
01:41:13,450 --> 01:41:16,420
And it is being handed between
the commissioner and Eddie Flint.

1486
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,860
The fight was stopped
on a signal from Joe Tryner--

1487
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:20,930
Attention, ladies and gentlemen!

1488
01:41:21,030 --> 01:41:24,860
The winner by a technical knockout
in two minutes and four seconds

1489
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,860
of the thirteenth round,

1490
01:41:26,970 --> 01:41:29,870
and the new World's Middleweight
Boxing Champion,

1491
01:41:29,970 --> 01:41:31,370
Sugar Ray Robinson!

1492
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:40,910
Why are you pulling out
of Wednesday's fight?

1493
01:41:41,550 --> 01:41:43,780
It's over for me--
boxing's over for me.

1494
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:45,640
I'm through.

1495
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:48,610
I'm tired of worryin' about weight.

1496
01:41:48,720 --> 01:41:51,780
That's all I used to think about
was weight, weight, weight.

1497
01:41:51,890 --> 01:41:54,330
After a while, you realize
there are other things in life.

1498
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:56,830
I'm very grateful.
Boxing's been good to me.

1499
01:41:56,930 --> 01:41:59,330
I got a nice house,
I got three great kids.

1500
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:03,290
I got a wonderful, beautiful wife.
What more could I ask for?

1501
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:07,500
- Hey, what's your name?
- Bob.

1502
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:08,800
Take a picture, Bob.

1503
01:42:09,340 --> 01:42:11,570
Let him take a picture
of ya, honey-- for us.

1504
01:42:11,680 --> 01:42:13,310
Go ahead, smile.

1505
01:42:15,550 --> 01:42:16,740
Thank you, Bob.

1506
01:42:16,850 --> 01:42:19,650
Take a picture of all of us.
Jackie, come here, sit over here.

1507
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:26,220
All right, everybody, smile. Smile.

1508
01:42:28,930 --> 01:42:31,290
Mrs. La Motta, how do you feel
about Jake's retirement?

1509
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:32,630
I think it's great.

1510
01:42:32,730 --> 01:42:35,060
He picked the right time
to stop fightin'.

1511
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:36,970
He's home with us
all the time now.

1512
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:39,200
- It's really good.
- You know what? You through?

1513
01:42:39,310 --> 01:42:41,870
- Excuse me, you through?
- Yeah.

1514
01:42:41,980 --> 01:42:44,140
I just bought a club
on Collins Avenue.

1515
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:47,480
It's a bar, package store, everything.
Guess what I'm gonna call it?

1516
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:48,550
I don't know.

1517
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:50,450
- What are you gonna call it?
- Take a guess.

1518
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,960
All right, shut up.
Enough, enough.

1519
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:07,990
Thank you.

1520
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:16,370
Just wanted to see
what the microphone

1521
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:18,840
on a sexy girl sounds like.

1522
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:27,580
See how that sounds.

1523
01:43:28,660 --> 01:43:30,120
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1524
01:43:30,220 --> 01:43:32,380
I haven't seen so many losers
since my last fight

1525
01:43:32,490 --> 01:43:33,960
at Madison Square Garden.

1526
01:43:36,630 --> 01:43:38,100
Okay, honey.

1527
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:40,770
Thank you, doll.

1528
01:43:41,630 --> 01:43:43,760
- Isn't that somethin'?
- Bring us another drink.

1529
01:43:43,870 --> 01:43:45,500
- Salute.
- Salute.

1530
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:49,840
Look at this terrific girl.

1531
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:52,280
She's the kinda girl you
wanna bring home to your father,

1532
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:54,680
especially if he's a degenerate.

1533
01:43:55,980 --> 01:43:57,110
Did I say that?

1534
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:02,510
Nah, seriously, folks,
it's a thrill to be standing here

1535
01:44:02,620 --> 01:44:05,350
before all you
wonderful people tonight.

1536
01:44:05,460 --> 01:44:07,760
In fact, it's a thrill
to be standing.

1537
01:44:10,330 --> 01:44:13,360
If you believe it's a thrill to be standin'
before you wonderful people, then...

1538
01:44:13,470 --> 01:44:14,660
you're all full of shit.

1539
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:20,540
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gettin' married.

1540
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,870
What am I talkin' about?
I'm out of it.

1541
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:27,550
Is she here?
She's not here.

1542
01:44:27,650 --> 01:44:29,480
Vickie?
Nah, she's not here.

1543
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:32,240
By the way, me and my wife
Vickie's gonna celebrate--

1544
01:44:32,350 --> 01:44:34,820
it's a little different--
our 11th wedding anniversary.

1545
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:37,150
Thank you.

1546
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:40,490
That reminds me about
two friends of mine.

1547
01:44:40,590 --> 01:44:42,490
One was married,
one was single.

1548
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:45,000
The married guy
tells the single guy,

1549
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:46,830
"What's the matter with you?

1550
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,090
"What's the matter with you?
Look at me, and look at you.

1551
01:44:49,200 --> 01:44:52,000
And look at me,
and look at you."

1552
01:44:54,970 --> 01:44:56,440
Let me get on with it.

1553
01:44:57,080 --> 01:44:59,140
"When I come home at night,
my wife's at the door

1554
01:44:59,250 --> 01:45:00,680
"with a tall drink in her hand.

1555
01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:02,910
"Then she gives me
a nice hot bath,

1556
01:45:03,020 --> 01:45:05,010
"then she gives me
a nice rubdown,

1557
01:45:05,120 --> 01:45:07,020
"then she makes
passionate love to me,

1558
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:08,850
"and then she makes me
a nice dinner.

1559
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:11,520
What more could you ask for?
You oughta try that."

1560
01:45:11,620 --> 01:45:14,150
The other friend says,
"Hey, that sounds great.

1561
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:15,730
What time does
your wife get home?"

1562
01:45:20,830 --> 01:45:24,060
I know I'm no Olivier,
but if he fought Sugar Ray,

1563
01:45:24,170 --> 01:45:25,730
he would say

1564
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:28,970
that the thing ain't the ring,

1565
01:45:29,080 --> 01:45:30,980
it's the play.

1566
01:45:31,780 --> 01:45:33,590
So give me a stage

1567
01:45:33,690 --> 01:45:35,990
where this bull here can rage,

1568
01:45:36,090 --> 01:45:37,990
and though I can fight,

1569
01:45:38,090 --> 01:45:40,490
I'd much rather
hear myself recite.

1570
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:48,100
That's entertainment!

1571
01:46:12,130 --> 01:46:13,930
Jake, how have you been?

1572
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,060
Hey!
You were just great.

1573
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:21,730
It's a good thing Sugar Ray
wasn't here tonight, huh?

1574
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,830
- He told that joke last week.
- Come on!

1575
01:46:24,940 --> 01:46:27,410
He repeats himself,
gettin' a little senile.

1576
01:46:28,210 --> 01:46:30,510
I'd like you to meet
State's Attorney Bronson.

1577
01:46:30,610 --> 01:46:32,740
- How are ya? Nice to meet you.
- And his wife.

1578
01:46:32,850 --> 01:46:34,280
- Nice to meet you.
- You shouldn't be here this week.

1579
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:37,790
It's next week we got
the shakedown payments, right?

1580
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:41,390
It's good seein' you.

1581
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:42,750
That is a joke, right?

1582
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:45,090
It's a joke--
only you know if it's a joke.

1583
01:46:45,190 --> 01:46:46,820
He's just kidding, right?

1584
01:46:47,360 --> 01:46:48,800
All right,
we'll talk about it later.

1585
01:46:49,530 --> 01:46:51,660
- This is your wife?
- Yes, Mrs. Bronson.

1586
01:46:51,770 --> 01:46:53,570
Very pretty lady.
Charmed to meet you.

1587
01:46:53,670 --> 01:46:55,540
- Thank you.
- He's really a nice guy.

1588
01:46:55,640 --> 01:46:57,940
You can take a joke,
can't you, doll?

1589
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,740
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1590
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:06,610
Hey, Carlo? Carlo!

1591
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:10,280
Give 'em another drink.
Somethin' happened over here.

1592
01:47:11,320 --> 01:47:13,880
- Darling, Linda, come here.
- Where's your wife?

1593
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:15,290
- My wife?
- Yeah, why isn't she here?

1594
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:16,950
What's it to you? You think
I'm gonna bring her around here,

1595
01:47:17,060 --> 01:47:20,090
- let you bums get involved with her?
- Come on!

1596
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:22,430
Especially the State's Attorney
over here?

1597
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:24,830
He comes here a lot,
darling, watch him.

1598
01:47:24,930 --> 01:47:26,490
He knows I'm only kiddin'.

1599
01:47:26,600 --> 01:47:28,570
- Thank you.
- Keep an eye on him.

1600
01:47:29,010 --> 01:47:30,230
What's the problem?

1601
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:31,360
There's really not a problem.

1602
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:34,340
She doesn't look 21,
so I just had to ask for some I.D.

1603
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:36,500
- How old are you, honey?
- Twenty-one.

1604
01:47:36,610 --> 01:47:37,910
- Twenty-one?
- Mm-hmm.

1605
01:47:38,450 --> 01:47:40,280
Can you prove
that you're 21?

1606
01:47:40,380 --> 01:47:42,350
- Mm-hmm.
- Prove it to me.

1607
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:51,360
Any girl that can kiss like that
can drink at my joint anytime.

1608
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:52,760
What about you?
How old are you?

1609
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:55,260
- Twenty-one.
- Can you prove that you're 21?

1610
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,330
- Yes.
- Would you prove it to me?

1611
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:58,730
Come here.

1612
01:48:10,810 --> 01:48:11,940
She's 21, too?

1613
01:48:12,980 --> 01:48:15,950
She has convinced me
that she's 21, too.

1614
01:48:32,100 --> 01:48:34,430
- Watch it while I'm pouring.
- Your wife's outside.

1615
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:37,010
- She's waitin' for you.
- Why don't ya tell me a little louder?

1616
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:52,150
There.

1617
01:48:57,630 --> 01:48:58,750
Come on, Jake.

1618
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:07,070
Lonely nights

1619
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:11,070
I'm so lonely

1620
01:49:11,610 --> 01:49:13,910
Please come home

1621
01:49:14,010 --> 01:49:18,310
You great big
lump of sugar

1622
01:49:18,850 --> 01:49:21,010
I miss you so much

1623
01:49:21,120 --> 01:49:22,950
Please come home

1624
01:49:23,050 --> 01:49:26,020
Lonely nights

1625
01:49:40,670 --> 01:49:43,140
It was a busy night last night.

1626
01:49:44,340 --> 01:49:46,970
- Everything all right?
- I'm leaving you, Jake.

1627
01:49:48,010 --> 01:49:50,500
- What else is new?
- No. I mean it this time.

1628
01:49:50,610 --> 01:49:52,910
I didn't wanna tell you
till I had everything worked out.

1629
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:56,710
- Move over.
- Why?

1630
01:49:56,820 --> 01:49:59,310
- So you can put your hands on me?
- Open the door.

1631
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:00,890
Come on, honey,
open the door.

1632
01:50:00,990 --> 01:50:02,510
I got a lawyer,
we're gettin' a divorce

1633
01:50:02,630 --> 01:50:04,560
and I'm gettin'
custody of the kids.

1634
01:50:04,660 --> 01:50:07,690
- Let me in for a minute.
- No, I already made up my mind.

1635
01:50:08,230 --> 01:50:09,790
I'm leavin'. That's it.

1636
01:50:09,900 --> 01:50:12,530
Kids are gonna be with me,
and if you show your face around,

1637
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:13,930
I'm gonna call the cops on you.

1638
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,470
- All right? That's it.
- Don't act that way, honey.

1639
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:44,730
Come on, champ.
Come on, wake up.

1640
01:50:44,830 --> 01:50:45,930
Wake up, champ.

1641
01:50:49,510 --> 01:50:50,530
What's up?

1642
01:50:52,340 --> 01:50:55,240
- We're from the D.A.
- Yeah, I know where you're from.

1643
01:50:55,340 --> 01:50:57,640
- They wanna talk with you.
- Youse all look the same to me.

1644
01:50:57,750 --> 01:51:00,150
- What's the difference?
- They wanna talk with you.

1645
01:51:00,250 --> 01:51:02,220
- About what?
- I don't know, I don't run the joint.

1646
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,720
- They just told me to bring you in.
- But what do youse want?

1647
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:05,950
For what?

1648
01:51:09,860 --> 01:51:11,720
Do you recognize this girl?

1649
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:14,790
She been in the club?

1650
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:20,600
- This is the same girl?
- Yeah.

1651
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:24,000
Nah, I don't know her.

1652
01:51:24,110 --> 01:51:26,270
She says you introduced
her to some men.

1653
01:51:26,380 --> 01:51:29,970
I introduced her to men. I introduce
a lot of people to a lot of people.

1654
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:34,390
You tell me I introduced her to men.
I introduced him to men.

1655
01:51:34,930 --> 01:51:36,550
But I don't say nothin'.

1656
01:51:36,660 --> 01:51:39,560
She's 14. Come on,
put on your shoes, Jake.

1657
01:51:40,670 --> 01:51:42,500
- She's how old?
- Fourteen.

1658
01:51:42,600 --> 01:51:44,570
She's 14?
Let me see that.

1659
01:51:51,310 --> 01:51:52,830
Let me ask you somethin'.

1660
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:57,080
You gonna tell me that
that girl looks 14?

1661
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:59,310
- She's 14.
- I'm gonna ask you man to man.

1662
01:51:59,420 --> 01:52:02,550
What am I gonna say?
Come on, we gotta go.

1663
01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:05,020
- We gotta go downtown?
- That's right.

1664
01:52:05,690 --> 01:52:07,660
For what,
because of this girl?

1665
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:12,320
- You drunk?
- Open the door, I'm out on bail.

1666
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:15,260
I just gotta pick up one thing
and I'll leave, I promise.

1667
01:52:15,370 --> 01:52:17,060
- Kids are sleepin'.
- I won't bother them.

1668
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:18,800
Let me just get somethin'.

1669
01:52:19,710 --> 01:52:21,540
All right, don't make no noise.

1670
01:52:21,640 --> 01:52:22,630
- What?
- Don't make no noise.

1671
01:52:22,740 --> 01:52:24,870
I won't,
I just gotta get this one thing.

1672
01:52:27,650 --> 01:52:29,810
- What are you doin'?
- I gotta get $10,000.

1673
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:31,820
My lawyer says if I can
spread 10,000 around,

1674
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:34,150
- I can get the case dropped.
- They don't have a case against you.

1675
01:52:34,250 --> 01:52:35,550
Oh, no?
You kiddin' me, or what?

1676
01:52:35,650 --> 01:52:37,950
You ever see a 14-year-old
testify in court?

1677
01:52:40,490 --> 01:52:43,490
You saw the papers--
"La Motta Out on Vice Rap."

1678
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:45,930
- What are you doin' to the belt?
- What difference does it make?

1679
01:52:47,100 --> 01:52:48,760
Can't you get the money
from your friends?

1680
01:52:48,870 --> 01:52:50,340
Yeah, what friends?

1681
01:52:51,040 --> 01:52:53,630
You're gonna wake my kids up!

1682
01:52:53,740 --> 01:52:56,110
You're gonna wake
the kids, stop it!

1683
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:04,510
What's the matter with you?

1684
01:53:04,620 --> 01:53:07,110
Don't you put the dishes
so they don't fall down?

1685
01:53:07,220 --> 01:53:09,310
What about the belt,
Mr. La Motta?

1686
01:53:10,020 --> 01:53:12,250
Isn't that what you wanted
to sell me, the championship belt?

1687
01:53:12,360 --> 01:53:15,330
- These are the jewels from the belt.
- But where's the belt?

1688
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:18,520
The belt of a champion
is a very rare item.

1689
01:53:18,630 --> 01:53:21,530
I wish you'd come to me
in the first place, Mr. La Motta.

1690
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:23,000
You'd have had the belt
and the jewels together--

1691
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:24,540
Give me 2,000 for them.

1692
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:26,940
- Give me 2,000.
- 1,500 top, that's all--

1693
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,940
- You can't give me 2,000?
- 1,500 top, Mr. La Motta.

1694
01:53:30,040 --> 01:53:32,940
- I'm sorry. I'd lose--
- Give me them.

1695
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,450
Don't tell me you're not
gonna make a profit.

1696
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:39,420
I know you're lyin'. Go around the corner,
I bet you I get twice what you're offerin'.

1697
01:53:40,820 --> 01:53:42,950
I can't raise the 10,000.

1698
01:53:44,160 --> 01:53:47,610
I tried, I tried.
I tried a lot of places.

1699
01:53:48,330 --> 01:53:49,790
Yeah, but what am I gonna do?

1700
01:53:50,830 --> 01:53:53,800
If that's what they're gonna do,
they're gonna do it, what can I do?

1701
01:53:55,330 --> 01:53:58,100
Then fuck 'em, let 'em do
what they're gonna do.

1702
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:02,970
Get in the goddamn cell,
now, come on!

1703
01:54:03,080 --> 01:54:06,670
- That's right, can't hurt folks no more.
- This is where it's at right here.

1704
01:54:08,510 --> 01:54:11,070
Who was the one goddamn
tryin' to shirk, huh?

1705
01:54:11,180 --> 01:54:13,480
- You'll pull your load here, boy.
- That's right.

1706
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:17,920
- I don't want no more!
- Get in the goddamn box!

1707
01:54:18,020 --> 01:54:21,150
I'll break you on one of
my fuckin' farms, you son of a bitch!

1708
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:23,250
- Do you hear me?
- Go fuck yourself.

1709
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:26,090
- Hold onto him just a minute!
- I got it.

1710
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:27,670
See it? See it?!

1711
01:54:28,200 --> 01:54:30,830
Look at it, son!

114
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,270
Just happen to have
a full tub in the back.

115
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,647
And you're lucky.

116
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,649
Only three people
have used it this morning.

117
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:14,236
Used it one at a time or all together?

118
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:22,244
I can tell you're accustomed
to fine living.

119
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,497
Bet you come from
one of those big eastern cities.

120
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,958
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans!

121
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,210
- You've been there?
- No.

122
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,921
But I got a cousin down there.
She runs a bar.

123
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:35,257
You know, she...

124
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,484
Jug.

125
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:27,614
Do you only know how to play
or do you know how to shoot?

126
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,746
Do you know how to blow music
from that?

127
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,809
Pick it up.

128
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,795
You!

129
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:33,346
You don't know how to play.

130
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:59,455
Try this one.

131
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,055
Take it.

132
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,743
Go on.

133
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,422
Here.

134
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,839
Bravo.

135
00:42:55,989 --> 00:42:57,281
Cheyenne.

136
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:59,575
We thought we'd never make it.

137
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,495
It's all right. You're right on time.

138
00:43:05,290 --> 00:43:07,291
To bury my escort.

139
00:43:08,001 --> 00:43:11,587
If I'd waited for you, I'd be in jail by now.

140
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,772
Hey.

141
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,158
The gun.

142
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,266
You interested in fashions, Harmonica?

143
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,817
I saw three of these dusters
a short time ago.

144
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:15,902
They were waiting for a train.

145
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:25,578
Inside the dusters,
there were three men.

146
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,706
So?

147
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,795
Inside the men, there were three bullets.

148
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:48,392
That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

149
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,063
For two reasons.

150
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:55,942
One, nobody around
these parts got the guts

151
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,945
to wear those dusters
except Cheyenne's men.

152
00:44:59,738 --> 00:45:03,658
Two, Cheyenne's men don't get killed.

153
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,455
That surprise you?

154
00:45:10,415 --> 00:45:11,499
Yeah.

155
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:17,964
Well, you know music.

156
00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,884
And you can count.
All the way up to two.

157
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,895
All the way up to six, if I have to.

158
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:35,982
And maybe faster than you.

159
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,956
Yeah, go on.

160
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:54,292
Play, Harmonica.

161
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,044
Play, so you can't bullshit.

162
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,173
Only, watch those false notes.

163
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:11,642
Like so?

164
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,950
And so, this cousin of mine

165
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,869
keeps writing me
to come on down to New Orleans.

166
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:33,664
"Come on down. Help me with the bar.
Make a pile of money."

167
00:46:34,499 --> 00:46:36,918
I don't think I'd get along in a big city.

168
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:39,462
It's too full of fast men
and loose women.

169
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,048
Begging your pardon, ma'am. Ah, no.

170
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:47,386
Now, I'm too used to
a quiet, simple country life.

171
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,789
He's Timmy.

172
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,957
Yes.

173
00:49:22,959 --> 00:49:24,752
Dear God.

174
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:28,214
On the day...

175
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,676
On the very day of your wedding.

176
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:34,845
Poor little miss.

177
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,349
Mrs...

178
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,852
Mrs. McBain.

179
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,772
But we all... Oh, but we thought...

180
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,358
I know.

181
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,693
It was to be a surprise today.

182
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,864
Brett McBain and I were married.

183
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,991
A month ago.

184
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,744
In New Orleans.

185
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,638
"I am the resurrection,
and the life.

186
00:50:17,722 --> 00:50:21,350
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.

187
00:50:21,434 --> 00:50:24,895
"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die."

188
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,105
Amen.

189
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,790
- Mr. Bennett!
- What's he doing here?

190
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,880
I found this collar on a nail by the door.

191
00:50:54,801 --> 00:50:58,637
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good as a signature.

192
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,806
Cheyenne's hand.

193
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:06,187
- But why?
- Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.

194
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:08,814
We'll make them tell us
before we hang them.

195
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,234
Let's get moving.

196
00:51:31,504 --> 00:51:32,755
Come on.

197
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,633
Let's go back to Flagstone.

198
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,429
No, Sam.

199
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,432
You go back.

200
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:47,436
You don't want to stay out here alone.

201
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:50,439
Why not?

202
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,483
This is my home.

203
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,348
You know, Wobbles,

204
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:56,935
I'm kind of mad at you.

205
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,275
Frank wasn't there.

206
00:56:04,777 --> 00:56:06,987
He sent three friends.

207
00:56:07,071 --> 00:56:09,781
I don't know nothing, I swear.

208
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:14,495
I only arranged the meeting
the way you wanted it.

209
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:17,956
I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

210
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,877
- I swear to you that I...
- 'Cause he was at the McBains'.

211
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:25,214
That's not true. Cheyenne did that job.

212
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,091
Everyone knows that. We got proof.

213
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:30,552
That was always one of Frank's tricks.

214
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,387
Faking evidence.

215
00:56:34,390 --> 00:56:35,849
I don't know.

216
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,476
I swear.

217
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,939
I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

218
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:44,483
I don't know nothing.

219
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,521
Who's there?

220
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,717
Did you make coffee?

221
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,097
Make it.

222
01:01:34,023 --> 01:01:35,774
Didn't sleep a wink.

223
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:40,987
A pack of turds dressed in black
rode herd on me the whole damn night.

224
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,827
Yeah, but I left them
in the middle of the desert.

225
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:49,120
If they're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

226
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:11,977
I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

227
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:22,153
They want to hang me,
the big black crows.

228
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:25,740
Idiots.

229
01:02:26,158 --> 01:02:27,993
What the hell?

230
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:31,246
I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

231
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:34,040
Be like killing a priest.

232
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:37,043
A Catholic priest, that is.

233
01:02:37,795 --> 01:02:41,089
Yeah, the world is full of people
who hate Cheyenne.

234
01:02:56,647 --> 01:03:00,817
See, I ain't the mean bastard
people make out.

235
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:09,200
Of course, if somebody
had a mind to kill me,

236
01:03:11,495 --> 01:03:13,038
it fires me up.

237
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:17,667
And a fired-up Cheyenne

238
01:03:19,837 --> 01:03:21,880
ain't a nice thing to see.

239
01:03:22,506 --> 01:03:24,716
Especially for a lady.

240
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,565
But you're too smart to make him mad.

241
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:50,241
So this here's where I was
supposed to do all the killing? Hmm?

242
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:52,243
Yeah.

243
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:57,248
Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

244
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:07,759
Now, if somebody gets dressed up
to look like me,

245
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,182
so they can hang this thing
around my neck,

246
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,602
I don't like it none.

247
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:20,814
But I can understand it.

248
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:24,943
Hmm.

249
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:29,197
What I don't understand is why.

250
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,701
Neither do I.

251
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,792
But I see you looked a lot for the why.

252
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,259
Yeah.

253
01:04:52,179 --> 01:04:55,056
What if there were
a whole heap of whys?

254
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:59,227
Round. Yellow.

255
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,480
You know the kind.

256
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,817
You rap them on a stone

257
01:05:06,902 --> 01:05:08,778
and they go "ding."

258
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,697
Maybe.

259
01:05:13,284 --> 01:05:15,493
But I didn't find them.

260
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:18,788
Hmm.

261
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:22,751
By the way,

262
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:27,130
you know anything about a man
going around playing a harmonica?

263
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,968
He's somebody you'd remember.

264
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,264
Instead of talking, he plays.

265
01:05:37,433 --> 01:05:40,310
And when he'd better play, he talks.

266
01:05:45,024 --> 01:05:48,443
You know, ma'am, when you've
killed four, it's easy to make it five.

267
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:55,200
Sure. You're an expert.

268
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:02,999
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

269
01:06:07,963 --> 01:06:10,256
Of course I have.

270
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:14,594
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money.

271
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:18,348
If you want to, you can lay me
over the table and amuse yourself.

272
01:06:18,557 --> 01:06:20,308
And even call in your men.

273
01:06:20,392 --> 01:06:23,228
Well, no woman ever died from that.

274
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:26,981
When you're finished, all I'll need
will be a tub of boiling water,

275
01:06:27,399 --> 01:06:29,818
and I'll be exactly what I was before.

276
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:33,738
With just another filthy memory.

277
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:52,423
You make good coffee, at least?

278
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,717
Not bad.

279
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,970
Congratulations.

280
01:06:57,638 --> 01:07:01,141
Tell me, was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

281
01:07:01,433 --> 01:07:03,643
I only told you to scare them.

282
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,397
People scare better when they're dying.

283
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:11,568
And can you tell me what good
was your stupid massacre?

284
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,155
Now, a Mrs. McBain has turned up.

285
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:21,161
So, I didn't expect that.
It happens in business.

286
01:07:21,453 --> 01:07:24,789
Let's say this is something
I didn't plan on.

287
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:28,459
I have no time for surprises, Frank.

288
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,671
You know that.

289
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:36,551
I got on board in sight of the Atlantic,

290
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:38,887
and before my eyes rot,

291
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:44,559
I want to see the blue of the Pacific
outside that window.

292
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,104
I know where you got on board.

293
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:50,815
I was there, too, remember?

294
01:07:55,696 --> 01:08:01,326
"To  remove small
obstacles from the track," you said.

295
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:04,996
Well, there were a few.

296
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,045
But we traveled a long way,
just the same.

297
01:08:12,129 --> 01:08:13,171
And fast.

298
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:17,800
Even tuberculosis of the bones
travels fast.

299
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:23,473
Don't play the sick man with me,
Mr. Morton.

300
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:27,018
I knew you
when you were just barely limping.

301
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:33,858
I watch that dry rot rise
a little more every day.

302
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:38,905
Any normal man would
put a bullet in his brain.

303
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:43,117
But you, you just got a little more hasty.

304
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,204
Otherwise you ain't changed any.

305
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:48,831
I'd say you've changed, Frank.

306
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,291
A lot.

307
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:55,213
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

308
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:59,592
Now, you're keeping in the background.

309
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,222
You'll end up giving orders.

310
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:09,811
It's because, now, I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

311
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:15,275
You're gonna need somebody more
and more every day to stay near you.

312
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:18,945
- Like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

313
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:20,238
Hmm?

314
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:33,126
How does it feel
sitting behind that desk, Frank?

315
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,923
It's almost like holding a gun.

316
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:46,431
Only much more powerful.

317
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:05,533
You see, staying with you,

318
01:10:07,619 --> 01:10:10,455
I'm beginning to think big, too.

319
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,543
This McBain business

320
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,464
has given me ideas.

321
01:10:25,846 --> 01:10:29,724
I'm sorry for you, Frank.
You're doing your best.

322
01:10:31,643 --> 01:10:34,187
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

323
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:38,232
Why?

324
01:10:38,317 --> 01:10:43,988
Because there are many things
you'll never understand.

325
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:56,667
This is one of them.

326
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:01,381
You see, Frank,
there are many kinds of weapons.

327
01:11:02,007 --> 01:11:06,302
And the only one
that can stop that is this.

328
01:12:00,732 --> 01:12:03,651
Now, shall we get back
to our little problem?

329
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:09,657
My weapons might look simple to you,
Mr. Morton,

330
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:14,954
but they can still shoot holes
big enough for our little problems.

331
01:12:15,664 --> 01:12:19,250
Pretty soon the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

332
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:24,922
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you.

333
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:27,800
"From now on,
there are no more surprises."

334
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:30,678
And then you happen
to meet a man like this,

335
01:12:30,762 --> 01:12:32,346
who looked like a good man.

336
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,932
Clear eyes, strong hands.

337
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:37,351
And he wants to marry you.

338
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:39,604
Which doesn't happen often.

339
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:43,024
And he says he's rich, too,
which doesn't hurt.

340
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:49,155
So you think,
"The hell with New Orleans.

341
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,575
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country.

342
01:12:54,286 --> 01:12:58,164
"I wouldn't mind giving him
half a dozen kids after all.

343
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:03,794
"Take care of a house.
Do something. What the hell?"

344
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:17,683
Well, God rest your soul, Brett McBain.

345
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:22,563
Even if he's going to have a job
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

346
01:13:37,663 --> 01:13:41,040
Still, I swear
he'd left money around someplace.

347
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:45,044
If you can find it,
you're welcome to it.

348
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:48,464
Mrs. McBain goes back to civilization.

349
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:51,968
Minus a husband
and plus a great future.

350
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:57,557
Hmm.

351
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:06,941
You deserve better.

352
01:14:09,444 --> 01:14:13,322
The last man who told me that
is buried out there.

353
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,501
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

354
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:31,841
She was the biggest whore in Alameda

355
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,552
and the finest woman that ever lived.

356
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:39,724
Whoever my father was,
for an hour or for a month,

357
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:43,269
he must have been a happy man.

358
01:14:54,197 --> 01:14:56,449
Hey! Hey!

359
01:14:57,909 --> 01:14:59,076
Hey!

360
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:06,477
What do you want?

361
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,021
Cheyenne's right.

362
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:13,234
Once you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

363
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:29,709
This isn't the time to leave.

364
01:17:32,063 --> 01:17:33,814
Give me some water.

365
01:17:43,408 --> 01:17:44,909
From the well.

366
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:48,704
I like my water fresh.

367
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:18,294
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

368
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:22,006
A sound? Like what?

369
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,258
Like that.

370
01:19:56,249 --> 01:20:00,377
He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

371
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:35,746
Morning, Mrs. McBain.

372
01:20:36,206 --> 01:20:38,749
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

373
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,877
Maybe you don't remember,
but yesterday at the funeral...

374
01:20:41,962 --> 01:20:43,921
I remember very well.

375
01:20:44,297 --> 01:20:47,174
Is there something I can do for you?

376
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:49,760
Yes.

377
01:20:52,305 --> 01:20:55,432
See Frank.
And tell him I know everything.

378
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:58,519
Why is everybody hounding me
about this guy Frank?

379
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:01,230
I don't know him.
I've never heard of him.

380
01:21:01,606 --> 01:21:05,359
I got my own worries,
and all I want is to be left in peace.

381
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:08,988
Tell Frank I want to negotiate with him.
Personally.

382
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:07,087
You were told
not to come here for any reason.

383
01:22:07,672 --> 01:22:11,216
Whatever business you have with Frank,
keep it far away from here.

384
01:22:11,301 --> 01:22:12,760
Yes, I know, Mr. Morton,

385
01:22:12,844 --> 01:22:14,678
but when I heard that woman say
she knew everything,

386
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:17,139
I thought that the important thing
was for me to come over here

387
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:18,432
right away and tell you about it.

388
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:20,559
You never thought it wasn't a trick?

389
01:22:20,977 --> 01:22:22,853
Sure, but you know
that I'm mighty careful, Frank.

390
01:22:23,688 --> 01:22:25,272
No one could have followed me.

391
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:28,233
That's the first thing I learned,
working for you.

392
01:22:28,485 --> 01:22:30,944
To listen unseen and to watch unheard.

393
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:35,115
You should learn to live
as if you didn't exist.

394
01:22:35,825 --> 01:22:37,743
You've known me
a long time, Frank.

395
01:22:37,827 --> 01:22:39,661
You know you can trust me.

396
01:22:39,746 --> 01:22:41,497
Wobbles.

397
01:22:46,086 --> 01:22:49,880
How can you trust a man who wears
both a belt and suspenders?

398
01:22:50,757 --> 01:22:53,801
The man can't even trust his own pants.

399
01:23:03,478 --> 01:23:05,062
Let's get out of here.

400
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:46,580
The end of the line.

401
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,584
Yeah.

402
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:58,050
Get him on board.

403
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,316
Tie him up.

404
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:49,351
Wait, Frank.

405
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:51,645
I didn't...

406
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,522
So, nobody followed you?

407
01:25:54,107 --> 01:25:56,441
No. You gotta believe me.

408
01:25:57,610 --> 01:25:59,945
So, this is the way I can trust you.

409
01:26:00,154 --> 01:26:02,948
I can explain. I didn't know that he...

410
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:06,535
- Get out.
- No. No. No, Frank.

411
01:26:07,287 --> 01:26:08,829
Get out.

412
01:26:22,885 --> 01:26:23,885
Shh!

413
01:26:27,765 --> 01:26:29,975
Frank, wait!

414
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:54,291
I told you to keep quiet.

415
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:01,465
Where are Logan and Jim?
They take care of the woman?

416
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:03,508
Someone took care of them.

417
01:27:04,135 --> 01:27:06,219
We found them out at McBain's place.

418
01:27:06,596 --> 01:27:09,014
Stone dead. And the woman was gone.

419
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:13,143
Your friends
have a high mortality rate, Frank.

420
01:27:24,697 --> 01:27:27,240
First three, then two.

421
01:27:39,587 --> 01:27:42,130
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

422
01:27:43,883 --> 01:27:46,968
And you're the one
who doesn't keep them.

423
01:27:48,679 --> 01:27:50,347
What do you want?

424
01:27:51,557 --> 01:27:52,974
Who are you?

425
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:57,896
Dave Jenkins.

426
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:08,657
Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

427
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:11,701
Calder Benson.

428
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:16,039
What's your name? Benson's dead, too.

429
01:28:18,167 --> 01:28:20,127
You ought to know, Frank,
better than anyone.

430
01:28:20,211 --> 01:28:21,545
You killed him.

431
01:28:22,213 --> 01:28:23,422
Who are you?

432
01:28:23,589 --> 01:28:25,882
- Who are you, you...
- Frank!

433
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:29,469
The woman.

434
01:28:31,889 --> 01:28:33,557
We're only losing time.

435
01:28:39,021 --> 01:28:40,397
All right.

436
01:28:40,731 --> 01:28:43,650
This time,
I'll take care of her personally.

437
01:28:43,901 --> 01:28:46,319
Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

438
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:53,243
Keep him warm for me.

439
01:28:53,327 --> 01:28:55,912
If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

440
01:28:56,247 --> 01:29:00,125
Not in the mouth.
He's got to talk. And plenty.

441
01:29:05,756 --> 01:29:07,841
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

442
01:29:07,925 --> 01:29:10,677
By the way, I want you to keep an eye
on that cripple all the time.

443
01:29:10,761 --> 01:29:12,095
- Understand?
- Sure, Frank.

444
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:47,357
- See anyone?
- No.

445
01:31:07,461 --> 01:31:08,587
There he is.

446
01:33:52,793 --> 01:33:54,878
You only know how to shoot?

447
01:33:56,380 --> 01:33:58,673
Or do you know how to cut, too?

448
01:34:10,144 --> 01:34:11,227
Hey, you.

449
01:34:13,397 --> 01:34:15,231
Wait a minute.

450
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,610
Let's have a good look at you.

451
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:32,665
Hey. Mr. Choo-Choo.

452
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:48,973
Hmm!

453
01:34:51,352 --> 01:34:53,228
It's easy to find you.

454
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:54,854
Bastard.

455
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,898
I don't have to kill you now.

456
01:34:56,982 --> 01:34:59,776
You leave a slime behind you
like a snail.

457
01:35:00,319 --> 01:35:03,363
Two beautiful shiny rails.

458
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,241
There's another bastard.

459
01:35:06,951 --> 01:35:10,119
And he's getting further away
every minute.

460
01:35:21,882 --> 01:35:23,049
There it is.

461
01:35:23,133 --> 01:35:24,592
Exactly what your husband ordered
from me.

462
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:27,178
And seeing as how he paid cash
on the barrel head,

463
01:35:27,263 --> 01:35:28,805
it all belongs to you.

464
01:35:29,139 --> 01:35:32,141
Oak planks, beech, pine.

465
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,269
All first-grade lumber.

466
01:35:34,353 --> 01:35:37,063
And there's beams
and foundation pylons.

467
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:41,442
Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar,
and all these tools.

468
01:35:41,777 --> 01:35:43,862
Maybe he wanted
to enlarge the farmhouse.

469
01:35:43,946 --> 01:35:45,822
Enlarge the farmhouse?

470
01:35:46,365 --> 01:35:49,200
He could have built
at least eight of them.

471
01:35:49,285 --> 01:35:50,952
By the way, ma'am,

472
01:35:51,745 --> 01:35:54,831
McBain also ordered this.
Said it was important.

473
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:59,127
Only it seems he forgot to tell me
what he wanted printed on it.

474
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:08,303
Station.

475
01:36:09,972 --> 01:36:10,972
How's that again?

476
01:36:11,473 --> 01:36:13,349
I said print "station."

477
01:36:45,841 --> 01:36:47,467
Looking for this?

478
01:36:48,218 --> 01:36:50,887
I've had enough of your butcher tactics.

479
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:52,889
I know that woman is here.

480
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:56,017
I don't want any more useless killing.

481
01:36:57,102 --> 01:36:59,437
I'm ready to make a deal for that land.

482
01:36:59,521 --> 01:37:01,481
To pay what's necessary.

483
01:37:01,565 --> 01:37:04,067
I don't want to waste any more time.

484
01:37:04,777 --> 01:37:07,236
You've made a big mistake, Morton.

485
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:15,828
When you're not on that train,
you look like a turtle out of its shell.

486
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:17,747
Just funny.

487
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:19,624
Poor cripple talking big

488
01:37:19,708 --> 01:37:22,377
so nobody will know
how scared you are.

489
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:24,379
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

490
01:37:27,299 --> 01:37:29,092
I don't have time to compete with you.

491
01:37:35,599 --> 01:37:36,808
Compete?

492
01:37:40,896 --> 01:37:42,563
Why, you...

493
01:37:42,648 --> 01:37:45,900
You can't even stand
on your own feet by yourself.

494
01:37:56,620 --> 01:37:59,288
Is that sufficient
to make you feel stronger?

495
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,750
I could squash you like a wormy apple.

496
01:38:05,212 --> 01:38:08,256
Sure, but you won't do it.

497
01:38:09,299 --> 01:38:12,635
Because it's not to your advantage.

498
01:38:19,768 --> 01:38:22,979
Who knows how far you'd have gone
with two good legs. Huh?

499
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:34,240
Help him back to the train.
Keep your eye on him.

500
01:38:37,119 --> 01:38:40,079
Morton. Don't worry about the land.

501
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:42,081
If you feel like paying for it, you can pay.

502
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:44,000
Of course, it won't make
any difference to you

503
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:46,169
dealing with the new owner.

504
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:15,406
Cheyenne! Hey, Cheyenne!

505
01:39:16,241 --> 01:39:18,785
There's a square staked out here.
it says "water tank."

506
01:39:19,495 --> 01:39:22,914
Over here, too.
Only, it says "post office."

507
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,208
And this one says "corral."

508
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:28,294
And this here "church."

509
01:39:29,004 --> 01:39:30,755
What the hell is this?

510
01:39:31,215 --> 01:39:32,548
Can't you see?

511
01:39:33,717 --> 01:39:35,259
It's a station.

512
01:39:36,637 --> 01:39:38,679
And all around it, a town.

513
01:39:41,517 --> 01:39:43,267
Brett McBain's town.

514
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:47,522
Was he crazy!

515
01:39:49,191 --> 01:39:51,484
Yeah, in a very special way.

516
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:54,445
An Irishman.

517
01:39:56,448 --> 01:39:57,490
He knew, sooner or later,

518
01:39:57,574 --> 01:40:00,868
that railroad coming through Flagstone
would continue on west.

519
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:03,788
So he looked over
all this country out here

520
01:40:04,873 --> 01:40:07,542
until he found this hunk of desert.

521
01:40:07,626 --> 01:40:09,752
Nobody wanted it.

522
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:15,049
But he bought it.

523
01:40:17,803 --> 01:40:22,348
Then he tightened his belt,
and for years, he waited.

524
01:40:24,059 --> 01:40:25,643
Waited for what?

525
01:40:27,229 --> 01:40:29,689
For the railroad to reach this point.

526
01:40:30,566 --> 01:40:32,775
Ah, but how in the hell could he be sure

527
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:35,778
the railroad would pass
through his property?

528
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:40,032
Them steam engines
can't roll without water.

529
01:40:40,492 --> 01:40:45,121
And the only water for 50 miles
west of Flagstone is right here.

530
01:40:45,706 --> 01:40:47,874
- Under this land.
- A-ha!

531
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:50,835
He was no fool, our dead friend, huh?

532
01:40:51,587 --> 01:40:56,132
He was going to sell this piece of desert
for its weight in gold, wasn't he?

533
01:40:56,717 --> 01:40:59,677
You don't sell the dream of a lifetime.

534
01:41:01,138 --> 01:41:03,639
Brett McBain wanted his station.

535
01:41:06,268 --> 01:41:08,477
He got the rights to build it.

536
01:41:10,647 --> 01:41:13,399
- How do you know all this?
- I saw a document.

537
01:41:13,483 --> 01:41:16,777
It was all in order.
Seals, signatures, everything.

538
01:41:17,821 --> 01:41:19,238
One thing, though.

539
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:23,492
In very small print,
there is a short clause,

540
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:28,080
which says that McBain or his heirs
lose all rights

541
01:41:28,165 --> 01:41:31,292
if, by the time
the railroad reaches this point,

542
01:41:32,669 --> 01:41:34,837
the station ain't built yet.

543
01:41:35,589 --> 01:41:36,672
Uh-huh!

544
01:41:41,845 --> 01:41:45,932
Speaking of railroads,
I noticed the rail gang's already...

545
01:41:46,683 --> 01:41:48,226
Hey.

546
01:41:49,519 --> 01:41:53,231
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills.

547
01:41:53,315 --> 01:41:57,735
And before you know it,
they're gonna be here.

548
01:41:58,195 --> 01:41:59,320
Yeah.

549
01:41:59,988 --> 01:42:01,072
Yeah.

550
01:42:02,532 --> 01:42:03,699
Listen.

551
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:05,993
Harmonica.

552
01:42:07,037 --> 01:42:10,248
A town built around the railroad.

553
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:13,709
You could make a fortune, huh?

554
01:42:15,379 --> 01:42:17,797
Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

555
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:20,967
Hey, more than that.

556
01:42:22,427 --> 01:42:24,345
Thousands of thousands.

557
01:42:25,722 --> 01:42:27,723
They call them millions.

558
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:31,727
Millions? Hmm.

559
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,649
- Yeah, millions.
- Yeah.

560
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:40,987
I always thought it'd be easier
to make a deal with a smart lady.

561
01:42:41,655 --> 01:42:43,531
All you gotta do is...

562
01:42:46,285 --> 01:42:49,662
Hey, what in the hell
are you standing around for?

563
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:52,331
But, chief,
what are we supposed to do?

564
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:54,500
What are you supposed to do?

565
01:42:54,584 --> 01:42:57,253
Build a station, idiots!

566
01:43:00,090 --> 01:43:03,050
I figure it ain't gonna
look like much.

567
01:43:06,096 --> 01:43:10,016
But it'll be the first thing
she sees when she gets back.

568
01:43:11,268 --> 01:43:12,893
If she gets back.

569
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:34,392
I think...

570
01:44:43,068 --> 01:44:44,193
Yeah.

571
01:44:45,404 --> 01:44:49,532
I'm beginning to think I might be
a little sorry killing you.

572
01:44:52,035 --> 01:44:53,828
You like being alive.

573
01:44:55,205 --> 01:44:56,288
Hmm?

574
01:45:07,634 --> 01:45:10,803
You also like to feel
a man's hands all over you.

575
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:14,223
You like it.

576
01:45:18,645 --> 01:45:22,440
Even if they're the hands of the man
who killed your husband.

577
01:45:42,502 --> 01:45:43,752
What a...

578
01:45:47,382 --> 01:45:49,133
What a little tramp.

579
01:45:52,262 --> 01:45:56,265
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do to save your skin?

580
01:45:59,936 --> 01:46:01,479
Nothing, Frank.

581
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:24,960
Hmm.

582
01:46:25,337 --> 01:46:28,297
Now I understand
why they miss you so much

583
01:46:29,841 --> 01:46:33,719
down there in New Orleans.

584
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:38,974
Great invention, the telegraph.

585
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:45,231
"Jill? The brunette?

586
01:46:45,941 --> 01:46:47,566
"My God, all the customers

587
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:50,236
"of the most elegant whorehouse
on Bourbon Street

588
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:53,322
"have been weeping ever since she left."

589
01:46:55,784 --> 01:46:57,243
Say, tell me.

590
01:46:58,745 --> 01:47:00,496
Did old McBain know?

591
01:47:01,414 --> 01:47:02,498
Yeah.

592
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,751
Yeah, I bet he did.

593
01:47:06,419 --> 01:47:09,004
He was just the type to marry a whore.

594
01:47:12,342 --> 01:47:13,425
Hey.

595
01:47:15,178 --> 01:47:16,637
It's an idea.

596
01:47:19,057 --> 01:47:20,724
I could marry you.

597
01:47:22,185 --> 01:47:24,478
And the land would become mine.

598
01:47:25,313 --> 01:47:26,564
And maybe

599
01:47:29,442 --> 01:47:31,485
you'd make a perfect wife.

600
01:47:35,865 --> 01:47:39,577
It would be me who wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

601
01:47:40,954 --> 01:47:42,204
Too bad.

602
01:47:43,206 --> 01:47:45,916
We'll have to think of another solution.

603
01:47:46,334 --> 01:47:47,876
Simpler.

604
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:54,466
Quicker.

605
01:48:16,615 --> 01:48:18,782
As sheriff of this county,

606
01:48:18,867 --> 01:48:22,286
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

607
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:26,915
of all property belonging
to Mrs. Jill McBain, here present.

608
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:30,836
This parcel of land measures 320 acres.

609
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:35,174
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

610
01:48:36,217 --> 01:48:38,344
This property and all it contains,

611
01:48:38,428 --> 01:48:40,679
lock, stock and barrel,

612
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:44,308
will be turned over to the lucky
purchaser at the time of sale.

613
01:48:44,392 --> 01:48:47,144
All the contents therein
are listed by number

614
01:48:47,228 --> 01:48:50,147
on the inventory sheet
distributed among you.

615
01:48:50,231 --> 01:48:54,151
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

616
01:48:54,235 --> 01:48:55,778
All right. That's clear to everybody.

617
01:48:57,697 --> 01:48:59,365
I declare the auction open.

618
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:02,493
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

619
01:49:07,123 --> 01:49:11,251
A list of all the
items. Some of them are worth money.

620
01:49:12,337 --> 01:49:15,964
All right.
Now, who's going to make the first bid?

621
01:49:19,928 --> 01:49:21,470
$200.

622
01:49:22,472 --> 01:49:24,973
Well, I have
an opening bid of $200.

623
01:49:25,433 --> 01:49:28,894
$200. Do I hear more?

624
01:49:28,978 --> 01:49:31,730
That stinking
piece of land ain't worth it.

625
01:49:31,815 --> 01:49:32,940
Is it, old-timer?

626
01:49:33,024 --> 01:49:36,068
Come on, my friends, $200.

627
01:49:36,611 --> 01:49:39,530
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

628
01:49:41,157 --> 01:49:42,324
Well...

629
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:45,828
Who's going to bid $300?

630
01:49:49,874 --> 01:49:51,583
Now, look, friends,

631
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:54,837
I realize we're not offering
California here,

632
01:49:54,921 --> 01:49:58,173
but 200 is damn little
for all that property.

633
01:49:58,258 --> 01:50:02,344
Ladies and gentlemen,
I wouldn't even take 200 as a deposit.

634
01:50:05,682 --> 01:50:09,101
Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

635
01:50:17,444 --> 01:50:20,487
You're sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

636
01:50:22,615 --> 01:50:24,992
I wish I were wrong, Mrs. McBain,

637
01:50:25,076 --> 01:50:28,036
but you're liable to end up selling
the place for a plate of beans.

638
01:50:35,462 --> 01:50:37,504
All I want is to sell.

639
01:51:44,405 --> 01:51:47,157
- You look fat, huh?
- If you say so.

640
01:51:48,326 --> 01:51:50,118
- How many?
- One card.

641
01:51:52,664 --> 01:51:54,039
One for me.

642
01:51:56,960 --> 01:51:58,710
Dealer takes three.

643
01:52:09,305 --> 01:52:11,598
Can I... Can I take a hand?

644
01:52:18,147 --> 01:52:19,398
Fifteen.

645
01:52:32,787 --> 01:52:34,746
Yeah, sit down.

646
01:52:58,438 --> 01:52:59,771
I'll deal.

647
01:54:44,961 --> 01:54:46,420
How do you...

648
01:54:47,797 --> 01:54:50,507
How do you play this game,
Mr. Morton?

649
01:54:53,219 --> 01:54:54,845
It's very simple.

650
01:54:56,180 --> 01:55:00,726
As long as you use your head,
you never lose.

651
01:55:01,602 --> 01:55:03,145
$500.

652
01:55:08,776 --> 01:55:10,193
$500.

653
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:12,279
Mmm-hmm.

654
01:55:12,363 --> 01:55:14,364
Do I hear any other bids?

655
01:55:16,784 --> 01:55:18,410
I don't think so.

656
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:29,129
I'm sorry, Mrs. McBain,

657
01:55:29,213 --> 01:55:34,176
but I think I'm gonna have to
knock down on that last bid.

658
01:55:45,229 --> 01:55:46,897
$500 once.

659
01:55:50,151 --> 01:55:52,360
$500 twice.

660
01:55:55,364 --> 01:55:57,824
- $500...
- $5,000.

661
01:56:21,724 --> 01:56:26,019
- You said $5,000?
- It's on its way.

662
01:56:38,991 --> 01:56:40,826
It's Cheyenne!

663
01:56:50,586 --> 01:56:53,672
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that right?

664
01:56:54,090 --> 01:56:58,135
Judas was content with $4,970 less.

665
01:56:58,761 --> 01:57:01,263
There were no dollars in them days.

666
01:57:03,432 --> 01:57:05,767
But sons of bitches, yeah.

667
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:21,741
Hey, wait a minute.

668
01:57:24,078 --> 01:57:26,913
- The jail's that way.
- Yeah, I know.

669
01:57:27,290 --> 01:57:30,709
Yeah, but you're going
to the railroad station.

670
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:34,296
I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

671
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:36,423
They got a modern jail there.

672
01:57:36,757 --> 01:57:41,136
It's got more walls, more bars,
more guards.

673
01:57:41,971 --> 01:57:45,807
Oh, you'll like it, in 20 years.
You'll see.

674
01:58:47,203 --> 01:58:50,497
Two tickets, amigo,
to the next station.

675
01:58:50,581 --> 01:58:52,040
One way only.

676
01:58:53,084 --> 01:58:54,084
Mmm-hmm.

677
01:58:54,835 --> 01:58:57,671
Here's to you. And congratulations.

678
01:59:02,551 --> 01:59:04,761
You got yourself a good deal.

679
01:59:06,222 --> 01:59:07,597
Oh, the auction.

680
01:59:08,724 --> 01:59:12,143
Forget it. I don't invest in land.

681
01:59:14,772 --> 01:59:19,234
You don't look at all like the noble
defender of poor defenseless widows.

682
01:59:21,237 --> 01:59:22,737
But then again,

683
01:59:25,616 --> 01:59:28,743
I don't look like
a poor defenseless widow.

684
01:59:35,584 --> 01:59:37,794
Cheyenne's right.
You're a remarkable woman.

685
01:59:39,797 --> 01:59:41,881
And you're a remarkable man.

686
01:59:42,717 --> 01:59:45,260
But you have something on your mind.

687
01:59:51,017 --> 01:59:53,143
And you got something on
your mind.

688
01:59:56,814 --> 02:00:00,775
Hot water. A bathtub full
of hot water.

689
02:00:19,503 --> 02:00:22,213
I think it's time I filled
that bathtub.

690
02:00:53,162 --> 02:00:54,371
Who are you?

691
02:01:15,976 --> 02:01:17,352
Jim Cooper.

692
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:20,021
Chuck Youngblood.

693
02:01:21,023 --> 02:01:22,524
More dead men.

694
02:01:26,362 --> 02:01:29,364
They were all alive
until they met you, Frank.

695
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:38,790
You paid $5,000 for something
that belongs to me.

696
02:01:44,004 --> 02:01:45,171
5,000.

697
02:01:50,302 --> 02:01:52,220
Plus one.

698
02:01:57,768 --> 02:01:59,978
You've got a right to make
a profit, too.

699
02:02:27,089 --> 02:02:30,175
I wouldn't take too long thinking
about it, if I were you.

700
02:02:35,055 --> 02:02:37,348
You got yourself into something
that's bigger than you are.

701
02:02:37,433 --> 02:02:40,101
You got a chance to get out easy.
You better take it.

702
02:02:40,561 --> 02:02:43,271
You sound like
a real businessman, Frank.

703
02:02:44,106 --> 02:02:47,317
Being with Mr. Morton
has done you a lot of good.

704
02:02:54,867 --> 02:02:56,826
And you've learned some new methods.

705
02:02:59,163 --> 02:03:02,081
Yeah, Mr. Morton has shown you
a lot of new ways.

706
02:03:06,837 --> 02:03:09,464
Even though
you haven't given up the old ones.

707
02:03:10,716 --> 02:03:13,635
Pick any method you like.
Just make the deal.

708
02:03:16,430 --> 02:03:18,097
Which deal, Frank?

709
02:03:21,227 --> 02:03:23,061
We have more than one,
you and me.

710
02:03:26,899 --> 02:03:32,403
We can lump them together
into one bundle, settle all of them.

711
02:03:33,030 --> 02:03:34,489
Here and now.

712
02:03:36,742 --> 02:03:38,493
Easy, Frank.

713
02:03:39,161 --> 02:03:40,286
Easy.

714
02:03:41,455 --> 02:03:43,623
You gotta learn not to push things.

715
02:03:43,874 --> 02:03:46,834
Taking it easy is the first thing
a businessman should do.

716
02:03:50,172 --> 02:03:53,841
I got an idea Mr. Morton
can teach you a lot more.

717
02:03:57,846 --> 02:03:59,138
How much?

718
02:04:00,516 --> 02:04:01,849
$1.

719
02:05:06,957 --> 02:05:08,583
Giddy up!

720
02:06:42,928 --> 02:06:44,345
Giddy up!

721
02:07:48,535 --> 02:07:51,204
I could swear we're going to have
that strange sound.

722
02:07:51,288 --> 02:07:52,622
Right now.

723
02:09:45,569 --> 02:09:46,986
Time sure flies.

724
02:09:48,780 --> 02:09:50,573
It's already past 12:00.

725
02:10:50,217 --> 02:10:52,593
But... But they were his men.

726
02:10:52,678 --> 02:10:55,096
- Yeah.
- And they tried to kill him.

727
02:10:55,555 --> 02:10:57,431
They must have found somebody
who pays better.

728
02:10:57,516 --> 02:10:58,557
And you!

729
02:10:58,976 --> 02:11:00,851
You saved his life.

730
02:11:03,480 --> 02:11:06,607
I didn't let them kill him
and that's not the same thing.

731
02:11:19,454 --> 02:11:20,871
Sure.

732
02:11:21,456 --> 02:11:23,916
It's not the same thing.

733
02:11:31,258 --> 02:11:32,842
You get dressed.

734
02:11:33,260 --> 02:11:34,677
It's time to go home.

735
02:16:54,289 --> 02:16:56,040
Did you make coffee?

736
02:16:57,584 --> 02:16:59,168
This time I did.

737
02:17:39,667 --> 02:17:40,751
Good.

738
02:17:43,380 --> 02:17:46,507
My mother used to make
coffee this way.

739
02:17:47,342 --> 02:17:52,012
Hot, strong and good.

740
02:18:01,523 --> 02:18:03,190
- Cheyenne.
- Huh?

741
02:18:05,402 --> 02:18:07,736
What's he waiting for out there?

742
02:18:10,365 --> 02:18:11,490
What's he doing?

743
02:18:17,497 --> 02:18:19,915
He's whittling on a piece of wood.

744
02:18:22,460 --> 02:18:25,170
I got a feeling when he
stops whittling,

745
02:18:26,631 --> 02:18:30,926
something's gonna happen.

746
02:19:37,202 --> 02:19:39,203
Surprised to see me here?

747
02:19:41,331 --> 02:19:42,998
I knew you'd come.

748
02:20:06,689 --> 02:20:09,691
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

749
02:20:11,027 --> 02:20:12,819
Now I understand why.

750
02:20:15,156 --> 02:20:19,493
Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing
you were around somewhere alive.

751
02:20:20,662 --> 02:20:23,997
So you found out
you're not a businessman after all?

752
02:20:24,541 --> 02:20:25,707
Just a man.

753
02:20:28,378 --> 02:20:30,003
An ancient race.

754
02:20:36,386 --> 02:20:40,681
Other Mortons will be along
and they'll kill it off.

755
02:20:41,057 --> 02:20:43,016
The future don't matter to us.

756
02:20:43,893 --> 02:20:45,102
Nothing matters now.

757
02:20:45,186 --> 02:20:48,522
Not the land, not the money,
not the woman.

758
02:20:49,148 --> 02:20:51,024
I came here to see you.

759
02:20:53,611 --> 02:20:56,697
'Cause I know that now
you'll tell me what you're after.

760
02:21:12,005 --> 02:21:14,089
Only at the point of dying.

761
02:21:17,427 --> 02:21:18,635
I know.

762
02:22:03,306 --> 02:22:07,017
I heated some water for you.
I also found a razor.

763
02:22:07,977 --> 02:22:10,103
Put it there, please.

764
02:22:12,523 --> 02:22:16,234
So I can watch the railroad move up
while I shave.

765
02:22:22,742 --> 02:22:24,117
You know what?

766
02:22:25,912 --> 02:22:28,580
If I was you, I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

767
02:22:38,216 --> 02:22:39,841
You can't imagine

768
02:22:41,135 --> 02:22:44,304
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

769
02:22:46,766 --> 02:22:48,517
Just to look at her.

770
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:55,482
And if one of them
should pat your behind,

771
02:22:57,527 --> 02:23:00,153
just make believe it's nothing.

772
02:23:03,116 --> 02:23:04,658
They earned it.

773
02:27:38,933 --> 02:27:41,267
Keep your loving brother happy.

774
02:31:00,217 --> 02:31:02,635
Who... Who are you?

775
02:32:10,412 --> 02:32:14,249
Hey. You're sort of a handsome man.

776
02:32:17,378 --> 02:32:19,420
But I'm not the right man.

777
02:32:32,309 --> 02:32:33,977
And neither is he.

778
02:32:36,814 --> 02:32:38,147
Maybe not.

779
02:32:38,732 --> 02:32:40,233
But it doesn't matter.

780
02:32:44,613 --> 02:32:46,739
You don't understand, Jill.

781
02:32:48,284 --> 02:32:51,244
People like that have
something inside.

782
02:32:53,580 --> 02:32:55,873
Something to do with death.

783
02:32:59,253 --> 02:33:03,423
If that fella lives,
he'll come in through that door,

784
02:33:04,300 --> 02:33:06,592
pick up his gear and say adis.

785
02:33:12,349 --> 02:33:14,976
It would be nice to
see this town grow.

786
02:34:47,027 --> 02:34:48,361
Now I gotta go.

787
02:35:34,658 --> 02:35:38,244
Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.

788
02:35:42,916 --> 02:35:45,251
I hope you'll come back someday.

789
02:36:03,020 --> 02:36:04,270
Someday.

790
02:36:16,658 --> 02:36:20,536
Yeah. I gotta go, too.

791
02:36:46,480 --> 02:36:48,523
Make believe it's nothing.

792
02:38:54,107 --> 02:38:55,775
Sorry, Harmonica.

793
02:38:56,318 --> 02:38:58,319
I gotta stay here.

794
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:37,983
Who?

795
02:39:41,697 --> 02:39:43,698
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.

796
02:39:44,741 --> 02:39:48,160
I didn't count on
that half-man from the train.

797
02:39:48,995 --> 02:39:51,038
He got scared.

798
02:40:09,474 --> 02:40:11,016
Hey, Harmonica.

799
02:40:12,519 --> 02:40:14,270
When they do you in,

800
02:40:15,021 --> 02:40:17,523
pray it's somebody
who knows where to shoot.

801
02:40:33,373 --> 02:40:34,498
Go away.

802
02:40:37,544 --> 02:40:38,794
Go away.

803
02:40:39,504 --> 02:40:42,548
Go away.
I don't want you to see me die.



1
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,470
The Hovitos are near.

2
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,057
The poison is still fresh,
three days.

3
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,808
They're following us.

4
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,813
If they knew we were here,
they would've killed us already.

5
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,859
This is it.

6
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,819
This is where Forrestal
cashed in.

7
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:59,071
- A friend of yours?
- A competitor.

8
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,782
He was good.

9
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,492
He was very, very good.

10
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,413
Seor, nobody's
come out of there alive.

11
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,498
Please...

12
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,453
Seor.

13
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:17,691
Stop.

14
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,819
Stay out of the light.

15
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,884
Forrestal.

16
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,600
Let us hurry.
There is nothing to fear here.

17
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,146
That's what scares me.

18
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,333
Stay here.

19
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,168
If you insist, seor.

20
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,922
Give me the whip.

21
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,215
Throw me the idol.

22
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,927
No time to argue.

23
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,095
Throw me the idol,
I throw you the whip.

24
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,889
Give me the whip!

25
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,641
Adis, seor.

26
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,478
Adis, Satipo.

27
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,478
Dr. Jones.

28
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:07,356
Again we see there is nothing
you can possess

29
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,066
which I cannot take away.

30
00:10:09,484 --> 00:10:11,068
And you thought I had given up.

31
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,916
You chose the wrong friends.
This time, it will cost you.

32
00:10:29,504 --> 00:10:33,841
Too bad the Hovitos
don't know you the way I do, Belloq.

33
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:35,926
Yes, too bad.

34
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,764
You could warn them,
if only you spoke Hovitos.

35
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,146
Jock! Start the engines!

36
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,939
Get it up!

37
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,820
Jock, the engines!

38
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,281
Start the engines, Jock!

39
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,041
There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!

40
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,378
Oh, that's just
my pet snake Reggie!

41
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,005
I hate snakes, Jock!

42
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,215
I hate 'em!

43
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,218
Come on!
Show a little backbone, will ya?

44
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,278
"Neo," meaning "new"

45
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:03,073
and "Lithic"... "I-T-H"...

46
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,993
"...I-C," meaning "stone."

47
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,786
All right, let's get back to this site:

48
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,454
Turkdean Barrow, near Hazelton.

49
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:14,334
Contains a central passage
and three chambers, or cysts...

50
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,218
...don't confuse that
with robbing, in which case we mean

51
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,305
the removal of the contents
of the barrow.

52
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,307
This site also demonstrates...

53
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,978
...one of the great dangers
of archeology,

54
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,231
not to life and limb, although
that does sometimes take place.

55
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,650
No, I'm talking about folklore.

56
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,444
In this case,
local tradition held

57
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,989
that there was a golden coffin
buried at the site,

58
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,326
and this accounts for the holes
dug all over the barrow

59
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,703
and the generally poor condition
of the find.

60
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,706
However, chamber three
was undisturbed,

61
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,416
and the undisturbed chamber
and the grave goods

62
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,917
that were found in another, uh...

63
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,337
in the area, give us a r...

64
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,548
Uh...

65
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,969
...reason to da...
to, uh, to-to date this,

66
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,679
uh, find as we have.

67
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:08,805
Um...

68
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,140
Any questions, then?

69
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,726
No? Okay, that's it
for the day, then.

70
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,479
Um, don't forget...

71
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,358
Michaelson, chapters four
and five for next time.

72
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:22,152
And I will be in my office
on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

73
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,330
I had it, Marcus.

74
00:14:33,414 --> 00:14:35,707
I had it in my hand.

75
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:37,626
- What happened?
- Guess.

76
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:41,546
- Belloq?
- You want to hear about it?

77
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:43,215
Not at all.

78
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,092
I'm sure everything you do
for the museum

79
00:14:45,176 --> 00:14:48,303
conforms to the International Treaty
for the Protection of Antiquities.

80
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,638
It's beautiful, Marcus.

81
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,640
I can get it.
I got it all figured out.

82
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,350
There's only one place
he can sell it: Marrakech.

83
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,726
I need $2,000. Look...

84
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:55,894
Listen to me, old boy.

85
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,354
I brought some people
to see you.

86
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:58,438
Look.

87
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,606
I got these pieces.

88
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,941
They're good pieces, Marcus.

89
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:03,068
- Look.
- Indiana...

90
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,196
Yes, the museum will buy them,
as usual, no questions asked.

91
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,739
- Yes, they are nice.
- They're worth at least

92
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,157
the price
of a ticket to Marrakech.

93
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,492
But the people
I brought are important,

94
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:11,952
- and they're waiting.
- What people?

95
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,912
Army Intelligence.

96
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,622
They knew you were coming
before I did.

97
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,165
Seem to know everything.

98
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,251
They wouldn't tell me
what they want.

99
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,336
Well, what do I want
to see them for?

100
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,338
What am I, in trouble?

101
00:15:23,673 --> 00:15:24,798
Yes, Dr. Jones,

102
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,341
we've heard a great deal
about you.

103
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,135
Have you?

104
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:30,429
Uh, professor of archeology,

105
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,180
expert on the occult,

106
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,807
and, uh, how does one say it?

107
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:36,560
Obtainer of rare antiquities.

108
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:37,769
That's one way of saying it.

109
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:39,104
Why don't you sit down?
You'll be more comfortable.

110
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,689
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

111
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,067
Yes, you're a man
of many talents.

112
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:46,486
Now, you studied
under Professor Ravenwood

113
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,280
at the University of Chicago.

114
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,615
Yes, I did.

115
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,243
You have no idea
of his present whereabouts?

116
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,621
Uh... well, just rumors, really.

117
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,373
Somewhere in Asia, I think.

118
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,125
I haven't really spoken
to him for ten years.

119
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,794
We were friends, but, uh...

120
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,088
had a bit of a falling out,
I'm afraid.

121
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,339
Mmm.

122
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:08,967
Dr. Jones, now,
you must understand

123
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,761
that this is all
strictly confidential, eh?

124
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:12,804
I understand.

125
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:15,265
Uh...

126
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,894
Yesterday afternoon,
our European sections

127
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,730
intercepted a...
a German communiqu

128
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:24,232
that was sent
from Cairo to Berlin.

129
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,610
- Now, to Cairo...
- See, over the last two years,

130
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,695
the Nazis have had teams
of archeologists

131
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:32,741
running around the world looking
for all kinds of religious artifacts.

132
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,367
Hitler's a nut on the subject.

133
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,494
He's crazy.

134
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,621
He's obsessed with the occult.

135
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,331
And, right now, apparently,

136
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,833
there's some kind
of German archeological dig

137
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:44,002
going on in the desert
outside of Cairo.

138
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,587
Now, we've got some
information here,

139
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:48,215
but we can't make anything
out of it, and maybe you can.

140
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:52,177
"Tanis development proceeding.

141
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:56,473
"Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

142
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,725
"Abner Ravenwood, U.S."

143
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,395
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

144
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,565
Just what does that mean to you,
uh, Tanis?

145
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,691
Well, it...

146
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:09,194
The city of Tanis is one of the possible
resting places of the Lost Ark.

147
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,946
The Lost Ark?

148
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,280
Yeah, the Ark of the Covenant.

149
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,532
The chest the Hebrews used

150
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:14,950
to carry around
the Ten Commandments.

151
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,117
What do you mean,
"commandments"?

152
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,702
You talking
about the Ten Commandments?

153
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:19,871
Yes, the actual
Ten Commandments.

154
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:21,456
The original stone tablets

155
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,500
that Moses brought down
out of Mount Horeb and smashed,

156
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,627
if you believe
in that sort of thing.

157
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,588
Any of you guys
ever go to Sunday school?

158
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:30,674
- Well, I...
- Oh, look.

159
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,342
The Hebrews took
the broken pieces

160
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,803
and put them in the Ark.
When they settled in Canaan,

161
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,514
they put the Ark in a place
called the Temple of Solomon.

162
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:38,640
In Jerusalem.

163
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,225
Where it stayed for many years.

164
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,394
Until, all of a sudden,
whoosh, it's gone.

165
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,645
Where?

166
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:45,605
Well, nobody knows
where or when.

167
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,566
However, an Egyptian pharaoh...

168
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,650
- Shishak.
- Yes.

169
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:51,486
...invaded the city of Jerusalem
right about 980 BC,

170
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,531
and he may have taken the Ark
back to the city of Tanis

171
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,533
and hidden it
in a secret chamber

172
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:57,867
called the Well of Souls.

173
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,536
Secret chamber?

174
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,246
However, about a year

175
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,498
after the pharaoh
would return to Egypt,

176
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,835
the city of Tanis was
consumed by the desert

177
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:10,005
in a sandstorm which
lasted a whole year.

178
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,340
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

179
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,094
Uh-huh.

180
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,887
Obviously, we've come
to the right men.

181
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,514
Now you seem to know, uh,

182
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:20,849
all about this Tanis, then.

183
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,350
No, no, not really.

184
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,853
Ravenwood is the real expert.

185
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:26,938
Abner did the first serious work
on Tanis.

186
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,566
Collected some of its relics.

187
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:32,444
It was his obsession, really.

188
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,862
But he never found the city.

189
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,282
Frankly, we're somewhat
suspicious of Mr. Ravenwood.

190
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,034
An American being mentioned
so prominently

191
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,286
in a secret Nazi cable.

192
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,705
Oh, rubbish.
Ravenwood's no Nazi.

193
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,540
Well, what do the Nazis
want him for, then?

194
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,084
Well, obviously,
the Nazis are looking

195
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,961
for the headpiece
to the Staff of Ra

196
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,255
and they think Abner's got it.

197
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,008
What exactly is a headpiece
to the Staff of Ra?

198
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,593
Well, the staff
is just a stick...

199
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:57,927
I don't know, about this big,

200
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,763
nobody really knows
for sure how high...

201
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:02,849
And it's... it's, uh...
it's capped

202
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:05,435
with an elaborate headpiece...

203
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,480
in the shape of the sun,
with a crystal in the center.

204
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,148
And what you did was

205
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,984
you take the staff
to a special room in Tanis...

206
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,402
A map room with a miniature

207
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,904
of the city all laid out
on the floor,

208
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,989
and if you put the staff
in a certain place,

209
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:20,950
at a certain time of day,
the sun shone through here

210
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:24,788
and made a beam that came down
on the floor here...

211
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,791
and gave you the exact location
of the Well of the Souls.

212
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,293
Where the Ark of the Covenant
was kept, right?

213
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,629
Which is exactly what the Nazis
are looking for.

214
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,964
What does this Ark look like?

215
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,383
Uh...

216
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,760
There's a picture of it
right here.

217
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,266
That's it.

218
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,108
Good God.

219
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,735
Yes, that's just
what the Hebrews thought.

220
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,195
Uh...

221
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,739
now, what's that supposed to be
coming out of there?

222
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,491
Lightning...

223
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,535
fire...

224
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,787
power of God or something.

225
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,665
I'm beginning to understand

226
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,166
Hitler's interest in this.

227
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,626
Oh, yes.

228
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,878
The Bible speaks of the
Ark leveling mountains,

229
00:20:13,963 --> 00:20:17,465
and laying waste
to entire regions.

230
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,428
An army which carries
the Ark before it...

231
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,971
is invincible.

232
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:45,535
You did it, didn't you?

233
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,245
They want you to go for it.

234
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,748
Oh, Marcus!

235
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:52,542
They want you to get a hold of
the Ark before the Nazis do

236
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,794
and they're prepared
to pay handsomely for it.

237
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,045
And the museum?

238
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,380
The museum gets the Ark
when we're finished?

239
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,840
Oh, yes.

240
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,386
Oh...

241
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,513
The Ark of the Covenant.

242
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,266
Nothing else has come close.

243
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:09,559
That thing represents everything

244
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,062
we got into archeology
for in the first place.

245
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,815
Mmm!

246
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:18,485
You know, five years ago,
I would've gone after it myself.

247
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,779
I'm really rather envious.

248
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,947
I've got to locate Abner.

249
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,699
I think I know where to start.

250
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,790
Suppose she'll
still be with him?

251
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,792
Possibly, but...

252
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,919
Marion's the least
of your worries right now,

253
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,629
believe me, Indy.

254
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,672
What do you mean?

255
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,550
Well, I mean that
for nearly 3,000 years,

256
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:46,763
man has been searching
for the Lost Ark.

257
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:50,600
Not something to be taken
lightly.

258
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:54,646
No one knows its secrets.

259
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,107
It's like nothing you've ever
gone after before.

260
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,193
Oh, Marcus.

261
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,778
What are you trying to do,
scare me?

262
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:02,862
You sound like my mother.

263
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,322
We've known each other
for a long time.

264
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,992
I don't believe in magic,
a lot of superstitious hocus-pocus.

265
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,202
I'm going after a find

266
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,037
of incredible
historical significance.

267
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,997
You're talking
about the bogeyman.

268
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,667
Besides, you know
what a cautious fellow I am.

269
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,054
Nice to see you again,
Dr. Jones.

270
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,138
Thank you.

271
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:43,463
Shh... shh...

272
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:02,649
Shh...

273
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,307
Give him space!
Give him space!

274
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,850
Go on, Regan!

275
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,146
Shh! Shh!

276
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,690
Shh! Shh! Shh!

277
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,819
Hello, Marion.

278
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,453
Indiana Jones.

279
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,999
Always knew, someday,

280
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,126
you'd come walking back
through my door.

281
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:47,462
I never doubted that.

282
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,839
Something made it inevitable.

283
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,425
So, what are you doing here
in Nepal?

284
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,428
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

285
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:59,891
I learned to hate you
in the last ten years.

286
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,309
I never meant to hurt you.

287
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,435
I was a child.

288
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,728
I was in love.

289
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:05,480
It was wrong and you knew it!

290
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:06,856
You knew what you were doing.

291
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:08,483
Now I do!
This is my place.

292
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,817
Get out!

293
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,322
I did what I did.

294
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:15,490
You don't have to be happy
about it,

295
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,450
but maybe we could help
each other out now.

296
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,412
I need one of the pieces
your father collected.

297
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,663
Bronze piece, about this size,

298
00:26:22,748 --> 00:26:24,916
with a hole in it, off-center,
with a crystal.

299
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,084
You know the one I mean?

300
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,794
Yeah.

301
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:29,087
I know it.

302
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:31,214
Where's Abner?

303
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,716
Where's Abner?

304
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,009
Abner's dead.

305
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,101
Marion, I'm sorry.

306
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,603
Do you know what you did to me,
to my life?

307
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,231
I can only say
I'm sorry so many times.

308
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,149
Well, say it again, anyway.

309
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,275
Sorry.

310
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,486
Yeah, everybody's sorry.

311
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,446
Abner was sorry for dragging me
all over this earth

312
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,198
looking
for his little bits of junk.

313
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,617
I'm sorry to still be
stuck in this dive.

314
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:03,079
Everybody's sorry for something.

315
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,956
It's a worthless bronze
medallion, Marion.

316
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,082
You going to give it to me?

317
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,166
Maybe.

318
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,001
I don't know where it is.

319
00:27:09,086 --> 00:27:12,505
Well, maybe you could find it.

320
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,716
3,000 bucks.

321
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:19,762
Well, that will get me back,
but not in style.

322
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,223
I can get you another two
when we get to the States.

323
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,058
It's important, Marion.

324
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,686
Trust me.

325
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:29,647
You know the piece I mean?

326
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,399
Do you know where it is?

327
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:35,987
Come back tomorrow.

328
00:27:37,531 --> 00:27:38,531
Why?

329
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,450
Because I said so, that's why.

330
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:49,750
Ha!

331
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,961
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

332
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,240
Good evening, Frulein.

333
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,950
The bar's closed.

334
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:07,078
We... We are...

335
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:09,080
not thirsty.

336
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:10,873
What do you want?

337
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:13,751
The same thing your friend
Dr. Jones wanted.

338
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,128
Surely he told you
there would be

339
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,339
other interested parties.

340
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,758
Must've slipped his mind.

341
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,095
The man is... nefarious.

342
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,432
I hope, for your sake,
he has not yet acquired it.

343
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,768
Why, are you willing
to offer more?

344
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:34,105
Oh, almost certainly.

345
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,815
Do you still have it?

346
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,822
No.

347
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,741
But I know where it is.

348
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:49,620
Hey, how about a drink
for you and your men?

349
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:54,625
Your fire is dying here.

350
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,461
Why don't you tell me
where the piece is right now?

351
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:00,047
Listen, Herr Mac...

352
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:04,427
I don't know what kind of people
you're used to dealing with,

353
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,929
but nobody tells me
what to do in my place.

354
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:10,558
Frulein Ravenwood,

355
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,520
let me show you
what I am used to.

356
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:20,026
Take your hands off me!

357
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,779
Take your lousy hands off!

358
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:31,746
Wait a minute.

359
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,164
Wait, I... I can be reasonable.

360
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,832
That time is passed.

361
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,584
You don't need that.

362
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:39,879
Wait...

363
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,758
I'll tell you everything.

364
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,677
Yes, I know you will.

365
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:54,185
Let her go.

366
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:10,428
Whiskey.

367
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:20,646
Shoot them.

368
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,523
Shoot them both.

369
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,871
My medallion!

370
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:29,048
Well, Jones, at least
you haven't forgotten

371
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,925
how to show a lady a good time!

372
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,593
Boy, you're something!

373
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,844
Yeah, I'll tell you what.

374
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,721
Until I get back my $5,000,

375
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,890
you're going to get more
than you bargained for.

376
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,434
I'm your goddamn partner!

377
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,724
Cairo, city of the living.

378
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,560
A paradise on earth.

379
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:25,521
Silence!

380
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,106
Why do you forget yourselves?

381
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,607
What is this?

382
00:34:28,692 --> 00:34:30,484
Where did this animal come from?

383
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,114
Oh... oh, no.

384
00:34:38,285 --> 00:34:39,451
Cute.

385
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,328
What an adorable creature.

386
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:45,583
Then it shall be welcome
in our house.

387
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,918
Oh, well, no, you don't have to
keep it here just because of me.

388
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:58,721
I knew the Germans
would hire you, Sallah.

389
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:00,931
You're the best digger in Egypt.

390
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:04,143
My services are entirely
inconsequential to them.

391
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,313
They've hired or shanghaied
every digger in Cairo.

392
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,148
The excavation is enormous.

393
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:14,028
They hire only strong backs
and they pay pennies for them.

394
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,488
It's as if the pharaohs
had returned.

395
00:35:16,698 --> 00:35:18,365
When did they find the map room?

396
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,992
Three days ago.

397
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,328
They have not one brain
among them.

398
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:24,371
Except one.

399
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:26,540
He is very clever.
He's a French archeologist.

400
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,210
What's his name?

401
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:31,545
They call him "Bellosh."

402
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,220
Belloq. Belloq.

403
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,350
The Germans have
a great advantage over us.

404
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,727
They are near to discovering
the Well of Souls.

405
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:51,565
Well, they're not
going to find it without this.

406
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,610
Who can tell us
about these markings?

407
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,281
Perhaps a man I know
can help us.

408
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,077
Indy...

409
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:06,872
there is something
that troubles me.

410
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,000
What is it?

411
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,127
The Ark.

412
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,505
If it is there, at Tanis,

413
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,883
then it is something that
man was not meant to disturb.

414
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,136
Death has always surrounded it.

415
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:23,097
It is not of this earth.

416
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:24,932
Do we need the monkey, huh?

417
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,517
I'm surprised at you, Jones,

418
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,228
talking that way about our baby.

419
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,021
He's got your looks, too.

420
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:32,106
And your brains.

421
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,024
Oops!

422
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:35,192
I noticed that.

423
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,820
She's a smart little thing.
Smart.

424
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:41,740
Hey!

425
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:43,033
Hey, where you going?

426
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,910
She'll be all right.
Have a date.

427
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:49,957
Come on. Come on.

428
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,959
- Okay...
- Marion.

429
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,043
What's this?

430
00:36:53,128 --> 00:36:54,461
It's a date.

431
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:55,754
You eat 'em.

432
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:47,181
How come you haven't found some
nice girl to settle down with,

433
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,141
raise eight or nine kids,
like your friend Sallah?

434
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,392
Who says I haven't?

435
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,270
I do.

436
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,189
Dad had you figured
a long time ago.

437
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,074
He said you were a bum.

438
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,493
Oh, he's being generous.

439
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:09,578
The most gifted bum
he ever trained.

440
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,789
You know, he loved you
like a son.

441
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,415
Took a hell of a lot
for you to alienate him.

442
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,708
Not much, just you.

443
00:38:32,894 --> 00:38:34,186
Marion, get out of here!

444
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:35,729
Duck!

445
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:18,897
Right.

446
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,442
Shh! Shh!

447
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,991
Marion!

448
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,513
Help! Over here, Indy!

449
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:34,640
Get out of the way!

450
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:36,183
Move! Move it!

451
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,518
Help me!

452
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,525
You can't do this to me!

453
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,277
I'm an American!

454
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,696
Indy!

455
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,368
Indiana Jones!

456
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,953
Help me, Jones!

457
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,392
Jones!

458
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:19,476
Marion!

459
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,190
Indy!

460
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,358
Marion...

461
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,147
Dr. Jones.

462
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,717
You looking for me?

463
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,061
Belloq.

464
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,771
Good afternoon, Dr. Jones.

465
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,731
I ought to kill you right now.

466
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:32,442
Not a very private place
for a murder.

467
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,196
Well, these Arabs don't care
if we kill each other.

468
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,491
They're not going
to interfere in our business.

469
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:42,119
It was not I who brought
the girl into this business.

470
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:44,329
Please, sit down
before you fall down.

471
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,040
We can at least behave
like civilized people.

472
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,387
I see your taste in friends
remains consistent.

473
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,390
How odd that it should end
this way for us,

474
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,393
after so many
stimulating encounters.

475
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:08,353
I almost regret it.

476
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,980
Where shall I find
a new adversary

477
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,731
so close to my own level?

478
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:13,859
Try the local sewer.

479
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,656
You and I are very much alike.

480
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,075
Archeology is our religion,

481
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,329
yet we have both fallen
from the purer faith.

482
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:30,000
Our methods have not differed
as much as you pretend.

483
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,253
I am a shadowy
reflection of you.

484
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:36,464
It would take only a nudge
to make you like me,

485
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,842
to push you out of the light.

486
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:42,345
Now you're getting nasty.

487
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,389
You know it's true.

488
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,433
How nice.

489
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,518
Look at this.

490
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,437
It's worthless.

491
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,731
Ten dollars
from a vendor in the street.

492
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:53,940
But I take it,

493
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,692
I bury it in the sand
for a thousand years,

494
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:59,362
it becomes priceless...
Like the Ark.

495
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:01,323
Men will kill for it.

496
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:04,117
Men like you and me.

497
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:07,704
What about your boss,
der Fhrer?

498
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:11,208
I thought he was waiting
to take possession.

499
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:13,835
All in good time.

500
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,962
When I am finished with it.

501
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:19,674
Jones, do you realize
what the Ark is?

502
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:21,635
It's a transmitter.

503
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:24,512
It's a radio
for speaking to God.

504
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:26,264
And it's within my reach.

505
00:45:28,184 --> 00:45:31,728
You want to talk to God?

506
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,855
Let's go see Him together.

507
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,565
I've got nothing better to do.

508
00:45:36,943 --> 00:45:38,777
Uncle Indy, come back home now!

509
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:41,988
Uncle Indy!

510
00:45:43,658 --> 00:45:45,116
Next time, Indiana Jones,

511
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,327
it'll take more than children
to save you.

512
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:50,580
Uncle Indy!

513
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:06,263
I thought I would
find you there.

514
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,598
Better than the United
States Marines, eh?

515
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:20,026
Marion's dead.

516
00:46:20,111 --> 00:46:22,529
- Yes, I know.
- And me! And me!

517
00:46:22,655 --> 00:46:24,239
I'm sorry.

518
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,908
Life goes on, Indy.

519
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,702
There is the proof.

520
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,162
Uh-oh.

521
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,915
I have much to tell you.

522
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,251
First we will take them home,

523
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,627
and then I will take you
to the old man.

524
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,056
I can't figure out
how Belloq did it.

525
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:33,558
Where'd he get a copy
of the headpiece?

526
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:36,895
There are no pictures,
no duplicates of it anywhere.

527
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,397
I tell you only what I saw
with my own eyes:

528
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:41,066
A headpiece like that one,

529
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,651
except round the edges,
which were rougher.

530
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,779
In the center, the Frenchman
had embedded a crystal,

531
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:50,283
and... and surrounding
the crystal, on one side,

532
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:52,452
there were raised markings,
just like that one.

533
00:47:54,955 --> 00:47:57,207
They made their calculations
in the map room?

534
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,666
This morning.

535
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,127
Belloq and the boss German,
Dietrich.

536
00:48:02,463 --> 00:48:03,797
When they came out
of the map room,

537
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,132
they gave us a new spot
in which to dig,

538
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,968
out away from the camp.

539
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,012
The Well of the Souls, huh?

540
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:14,933
Come, come, look.
Look here... Look.

541
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:16,559
Sit down.

542
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,144
Come, sit down.

543
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,480
What is it?

544
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,399
This is a warning

545
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:24,901
not to disturb
the Ark of the Covenant.

546
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,820
What about the height
of the staff, though?

547
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,071
Did Belloq get it off of here?

548
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,240
Yes. It is here.

549
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:32,117
This were the old way,

550
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:34,661
this mean six kadam high.

551
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,954
- About 72 inches.
- Wait!

552
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,335
"And take back one kadam

553
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,339
to honor the Hebrew God
whose Ark this is."

554
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,437
You said their headpiece
only had markings on one side.

555
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:02,439
Are you absolutely sure?

556
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,817
Belloq's staff is too long.

557
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:08,570
They're digging
in the wrong place.

558
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:13,783
I am the monarch of the sea

559
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:15,743
I am the ruler of the...

560
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,339
Bad dates.

561
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,607
I told you not to be premature

562
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,984
in your communiqu to Berlin.

563
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,905
Archeology is not
an exact science.

564
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:54,157
It does not deal
in time schedules.

565
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,867
The Fhrer is not
a patient man.

566
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:59,162
He demands constant reports,
and he expects progress.

567
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,330
You led me to believe...

568
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:02,207
Nothing!
I made no promises.

569
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:04,501
I only said
it looked very favorable.

570
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,587
Besides, with the information
in our possession,

571
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,255
my calculations were correct.

572
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,549
Boy, they're not kidding,
are they?

573
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,345
What time does the sun
hit the map room?

574
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,388
At about 9:00 in the morning.

575
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,265
Not much time, then.

576
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,434
Where are they digging
for the Well of the Souls?

577
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:24,646
On that ridge...
but the map room's over there.

578
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,064
Let's go, come on.

579
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:34,020
Sallah.

580
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,106
Sallah!

581
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,032
They're here.

582
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,252
Please, my friend,
what is the matter?

583
00:54:58,337 --> 00:55:00,046
I fetch the water.
I shall get it for you.

584
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:04,383
If you want water,
I will get you water.

585
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,760
No problem, no problem.

586
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,151
I thought you were dead.

587
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,736
You must have switched baskets.

588
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,200
Are you hurt?

589
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,661
No. You have to get me
out of here, quick.

590
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,704
They're gonna be back
at any minute.

591
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,289
Cut me loose.

592
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:36,374
Quick.

593
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:39,001
They keep asking about you.
What you know.

594
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,007
What's wrong?

595
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,175
Cut me loose.

596
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,593
I know where the Ark is, Marion.

597
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,761
The Ark's here?

598
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,514
I'm coming with you, Jones.
Get me out of here!

599
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,932
Cut me loose!
You can't leave me here!

600
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:54,058
If I take you out of here now,

601
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,601
they'll start combing
the place for us.

602
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,186
Jones, you've got to get me
out of here!

603
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,647
Come on, Jones, are you crazy?

604
00:56:00,399 --> 00:56:01,858
Marion, I hate to do this,

605
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,527
but if you don't sit
still and keep quiet,

606
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,696
this whole thing
is going to be shot.

607
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,365
I'll be back to get you.

608
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,325
Jones, what's the matter?

609
00:56:56,997 --> 00:56:58,623
That's it.

610
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,458
Who knows?

611
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,251
Perhaps the Ark is still waiting

612
00:57:02,336 --> 00:57:05,087
in some antechamber
for us to discover.

613
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:08,382
Perhaps there's some vital
bit of evidence which eludes us.

614
00:57:08,467 --> 00:57:10,927
- Perhaps...
- Perhaps the girl can help us.

615
00:57:11,053 --> 00:57:12,386
My feeling exactly.

616
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,889
She was in possession
of the original piece for years.

617
00:57:15,015 --> 00:57:17,683
She may know much,
if properly motivated.

618
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,102
I tell you,
the girl knows nothing.

619
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:23,064
I'm surprised
to find you squeamish.

620
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:25,107
That is not your reputation.

621
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,484
But it needn't concern you.

622
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,778
I have the perfect man
for this kind of work.

623
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,868
Heil Hitler.

624
00:58:58,618 --> 00:58:59,869
Indy! Here!

625
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,328
We've hit stone!

626
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,209
Clear it off.

627
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,669
Come on, find the edges.

628
00:59:25,145 --> 00:59:26,771
Good, good, good.

629
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,147
You see, Indy? You see?

630
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,149
Okay, bring the pry bars in.

631
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:31,901
As a team, boys! As a team!

632
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,112
Push!

633
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:41,911
Get 'em in there.
Get 'em under.

634
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:43,204
Good, good, that's it.

635
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:44,705
Watch your toes.

636
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:53,756
Carefully, carefully!

637
01:00:06,186 --> 01:00:07,812
Sorry, Indy.

638
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,731
Indy...

639
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:13,025
why does the floor move?

640
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:16,821
Give me your torch.

641
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:49,270
Snakes.

642
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,313
Why did it have to be snakes?

643
01:00:54,693 --> 01:00:57,153
Asps.

644
01:00:57,279 --> 01:01:00,072
Very dangerous.

645
01:01:00,157 --> 01:01:01,574
You go first.

646
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:23,053
If you're trying
to escape on foot,

647
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:26,056
the desert is three weeks
in every direction,

648
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:28,058
so please, eat something.

649
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,109
I must apologize
for their treatment of you.

650
01:01:37,235 --> 01:01:38,402
Yeah. Whose idea was it?

651
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:39,612
No food, no water.

652
01:01:39,738 --> 01:01:42,156
What kind of people
are these friends of yours?

653
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,533
At this particular time
and place, to do my work,

654
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,619
they are necessary evils.

655
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,329
They're not my friends.

656
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:51,248
However, with the
right connections,

657
01:01:51,333 --> 01:01:52,708
even in this part of the world,

658
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,920
we are not entirely uncivilized.

659
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:58,589
It's beautiful.

660
01:01:59,341 --> 01:02:01,550
I would very much like
to see you in it.

661
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,763
I'll bet you would.

662
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:11,977
All right.

663
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,487
What do you got to drink
around here?

664
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,742
We don't have much time.

665
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,577
Soon they will come to harm you,

666
01:02:28,662 --> 01:02:30,746
and I will not be able
to stop them,

667
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,499
unless you are able
to give me something

668
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,501
to placate them.

669
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:39,171
Some, uh, piece
of information...

670
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,298
which I can use
to protect you from them.

671
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,093
I've already told you
everything I know.

672
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,595
I have no loyalty to Jones.

673
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,806
He's brought me
nothing but trouble.

674
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:57,189
Marion, you are beautiful.

675
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,363
I don't think
we need a chaperone.

676
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,452
Steadily.

677
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:11,954
Steadily. Whoa!

678
01:03:14,541 --> 01:03:15,666
Down...

679
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,001
Down... Whoa.

680
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,210
Carefully, carefully!

681
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:20,296
You all right, Indy?

682
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:26,719
Now gently, boys.
Gently, gently!

683
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,270
Whoa...

684
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,324
I told you it will be all right.

685
01:04:04,716 --> 01:04:06,258
Huh...

686
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,393
Sallah, get down here!

687
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:37,623
You pour.

688
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:32,946
Oh, that's good.

689
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:37,451
Whoops.

690
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:45,501
What is this stuff, Ren?

691
01:06:46,878 --> 01:06:48,378
I grew up with this.

692
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:51,715
It's my family label.

693
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:24,665
Well... I have to be
going now, Ren.

694
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:29,127
I like you, Ren, very much.

695
01:07:29,796 --> 01:07:32,464
Perhaps we'll meet someday
under better circumstances.

696
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,971
We meet again, Frulein.

697
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,474
You Americans,
you're all the same.

698
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,437
Always overdressing
for the wrong occasions.

699
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:20,804
Now...

700
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:25,684
what shall we talk about?

701
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,390
All right... take it up!

702
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,225
Easy!

703
01:09:50,103 --> 01:09:51,812
You're as stubborn as that girl.

704
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:54,773
You like her too much, I think.

705
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:58,193
Your methods of archeology
are too primitive for me.

706
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:03,115
You would use a bulldozer
to find a... china cup.

707
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:10,038
Colonel! Wake your men!

708
01:10:10,164 --> 01:10:12,124
Indy, the torches
are burning out.

709
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,126
Go on, get out of here.

710
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,961
Hyah!

711
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:35,981
- Sallah!
- Hello!

712
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,233
Hello!

713
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,236
Why, Dr. Jones,
whatever are you doing

714
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,196
in such a nasty place?

715
01:10:43,322 --> 01:10:45,365
Why don't you come on down here!
I'll show you!

716
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:46,450
Thank you, my friend,

717
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:49,411
but I think we are all
very comfortable up here.

718
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:50,954
That's right, isn't it?

719
01:10:51,038 --> 01:10:53,790
Yes, we are very comfortable
up here.

720
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:57,169
So, once again, Jones,

721
01:10:57,295 --> 01:10:59,546
what was briefly yours
is now mine.

722
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,800
What a fitting end
to your life's pursuits.

723
01:11:03,885 --> 01:11:05,761
You're about to become
a permanent addition

724
01:11:05,845 --> 01:11:07,137
to this archeological find.

725
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,555
Who knows?

726
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:10,724
In a thousand years,
even you may be worth something.

727
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:14,603
Son of a bitch.

728
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,605
I'm afraid we must be
going now, Dr. Jones.

729
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,024
Our prize is awaited in Berlin.

730
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:20,442
But I do not wish to leave you

731
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:22,944
down in that awful place
all alone.

732
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:24,863
Slimy pig, you let me go!

733
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:26,865
Stop it!

734
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:30,952
Marion!

735
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:32,537
Hang on.

736
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:34,456
Don't...

737
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:35,832
- Indy!
- Don't fall!

738
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:37,918
Marion, I got you!
I got you! I got you!

739
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,382
You traitor!
You get your hands off of me!

740
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:53,600
Snakes!

741
01:11:54,977 --> 01:11:57,020
Oh, sh... oh, at your feet!

742
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,439
The girl was mine!

743
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:00,482
She's of no use to us.

744
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,275
Only our mission
for the Fhrer matters.

745
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:06,822
I wonder sometimes, monsieur,

746
01:12:06,906 --> 01:12:09,241
if you have that
clearly in mind.

747
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:11,409
It was not to be, chrie.

748
01:12:12,036 --> 01:12:14,120
You bastards!
I'll get you for this!

749
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:16,915
Indiana Jones...

750
01:12:16,999 --> 01:12:17,999
adieu.

751
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,514
No!

752
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:43,108
Take this.

753
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,068
Wave it at anything
that slithers.

754
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:46,319
Thank you.

755
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:48,738
Oh, my God, this whole
place is slithering.

756
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:52,868
Indy!

757
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:54,452
Ow! Jesus!

758
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,791
Where did you get this?
From him?

759
01:12:59,917 --> 01:13:01,334
I was trying to escape.

760
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,586
No thanks to you.

761
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:03,962
How hard were you trying?

762
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:05,213
Well, where the hell were you?

763
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:06,381
Watch it, watch it.

764
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:09,467
- What are you doing?
- For the fire!

765
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:13,221
How the hell are we going
to get out of here?

766
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,431
I'm working on it!
I'm working on it!

767
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,266
Well, whatever you're
doing, do it faster.

768
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:21,980
Ah...

769
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:23,815
Where are you going?

770
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,358
Through that wall.

771
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:27,986
Just get ready to run,
whatever happens to me.

772
01:13:28,321 --> 01:13:29,946
What do you mean by that?

773
01:13:42,001 --> 01:13:43,501
Indy!

774
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:46,504
Damn it! Don't you leave me
down here by myself!

775
01:14:11,197 --> 01:14:12,948
Indy!

776
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,199
Here we go!

777
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:15,450
Get ready!

778
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:19,412
Indy, the torch is going out!

779
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:01,621
Indy?

780
01:15:21,976 --> 01:15:23,685
Marion!

781
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:26,021
Look. Look.

782
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,270
They're going to fly it
out of here.

783
01:16:07,354 --> 01:16:08,480
When that Ark gets loaded,

784
01:16:08,564 --> 01:16:09,939
we're already going
to be on the plane.

785
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:18,531
Ah, monsieur, let us toast
our success in the desert.

786
01:16:18,616 --> 01:16:19,783
To the Ark.

787
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:21,826
When we are very far
from here.

788
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,620
That will do.

789
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:20,260
Hey, you now... Come here!

790
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:21,803
Come here!

791
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:28,369
Indy!

792
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:21,506
Stay with the Ark!
Stay with the Ark!

793
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:28,513
Look out!

794
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,191
Oh, my God.

795
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:41,442
Marion.

796
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:44,195
In here! Up here!

797
01:19:46,615 --> 01:19:47,657
Indy, come on!

798
01:19:47,741 --> 01:19:48,825
Pull on the latch!

799
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:50,910
Move up!
It's gonna blow up!

800
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:56,291
It's stuck! Indy!

801
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:58,835
I can't force the lock!

802
01:20:28,407 --> 01:20:29,574
It's stuck!

803
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:31,075
- Turn it! Turn it!
- It's stuck!

804
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,285
Turn it there!

805
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:33,995
Never mind!
Get back! Get back!

806
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,435
Get the Ark away from
this place immediately.

807
01:20:57,519 --> 01:20:59,187
Have it put on the truck.

808
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:01,189
We'll fly it out of Cairo.

809
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:04,108
And Gobler, I want
plenty of protection.

810
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:12,492
Jones.

811
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,332
Holy smoke, my friends,

812
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:21,459
I... I'm so pleased
you're not dead!

813
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:24,754
Indy, Indy, we have no time.

814
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,214
If you still want the Ark,

815
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:28,674
it is being loaded
onto a truck for Cairo.

816
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,593
Truck?

817
01:21:30,677 --> 01:21:31,928
What truck?

818
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:00,832
Let's go!

819
01:22:09,341 --> 01:22:10,800
Get back to Cairo.

820
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,969
Get us some transport
to England...

821
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:16,013
boat, plane, anything.

822
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:18,307
Meet me at Omar's.
Be ready for me.

823
01:22:18,392 --> 01:22:19,475
I'm going after that truck.

824
01:22:19,560 --> 01:22:21,102
- How?
- I don't know.

825
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,437
I'm making this up as I go.

826
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,238
Ew!

827
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:24,840
He's there!

828
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,394
Idiot! Idiot!

829
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:06,150
Everything at last
has been arranged.

830
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,776
- The Ark?
- Is on board.

831
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:09,528
Nothing is lacking,
now that you're here.

832
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:10,905
Or what is left of you.

833
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:13,449
- You trust these guys?
- Yes.

834
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,911
Mr. Katanga.

835
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:22,583
Mr. Katanga,
these are my friends.

836
01:30:23,251 --> 01:30:25,085
They are my family.

837
01:30:25,170 --> 01:30:28,255
I will hear of it
if they are not treated well.

838
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:30,758
My cabin is theirs.

839
01:30:30,842 --> 01:30:32,843
Mr. Jones...

840
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:35,429
I've heard a lot about you, sir.

841
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:37,890
Your appearance is exactly
the way I imagined.

842
01:30:43,146 --> 01:30:44,855
Good-bye.

843
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:48,984
Look after each other.

844
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,111
I am already missing you.

845
01:30:53,657 --> 01:30:55,157
You're my good friend.

846
01:30:57,827 --> 01:30:59,244
Sallah.

847
01:31:02,999 --> 01:31:04,541
That is for Fayah...

848
01:31:06,252 --> 01:31:07,753
that is for your children...

849
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:10,255
and this is for you.

850
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:16,220
Thank you.

851
01:31:25,522 --> 01:31:30,734
A British tar is a soaring soul

852
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:34,822
As free as a mountain bird

853
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:39,118
His energetic fist
should be ready to...

854
01:31:40,745 --> 01:31:43,205
...a dictator...

855
01:31:49,963 --> 01:31:51,255
Where did you go?

856
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:53,132
I'm cleaning up.

857
01:31:54,509 --> 01:31:56,427
Where'd you get that?

858
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:57,970
From him.

859
01:31:58,054 --> 01:31:59,304
Who him?

860
01:31:59,389 --> 01:32:00,431
Katanga.

861
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:01,807
I got a feeling
I'm not the first woman

862
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:04,018
ever to travel
with these pirates.

863
01:32:04,102 --> 01:32:06,353
It's lovely.

864
01:32:06,438 --> 01:32:07,521
Yeah?

865
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:08,605
Yeah.

866
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:09,732
Really?

867
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:11,108
Yeah.

868
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:23,746
What'd you say?

869
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:32,421
Wait... I don't need any help.

870
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,299
You know you do.

871
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,762
You're not the man
I knew ten years ago.

872
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:43,265
It's not the years, honey,
it's the mileage.

873
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,439
You are...

874
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:53,025
Please, I don't need a nurse.

875
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:54,568
- I just want to sleep.
- Don't be such a baby.

876
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:55,819
Marion, leave me alone.

877
01:32:55,904 --> 01:32:57,029
- What is this here?
- Go away.

878
01:32:57,155 --> 01:32:59,615
Yes, it hurts.

879
01:32:59,699 --> 01:33:00,741
Ow!

880
01:33:00,825 --> 01:33:04,286
Well, goddamn it, Indy,
where doesn't it hurt?

881
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:06,163
Here.

882
01:33:12,003 --> 01:33:13,420
Here.

883
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:23,847
This isn't too bad.

884
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:34,358
Here.

885
01:33:55,547 --> 01:33:56,547
Jones...

886
01:33:59,384 --> 01:34:00,801
Jones?

887
01:34:03,638 --> 01:34:05,681
We never seem to get
a break, do we?

888
01:34:34,169 --> 01:34:35,169
What is it?

889
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:38,130
Engines have stopped.
I'm going to go check.

890
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:51,059
- What's happening?
- We have most important friends.

891
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:52,811
Holy shit.

892
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:56,773
I sent my man for you.
You and the girl must disappear.

893
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:58,275
We have a place in the hold.
Come on, go, go, go.

894
01:34:58,359 --> 01:34:59,359
Come on, go, my friend, go.

895
01:35:13,166 --> 01:35:14,208
Where is Dr. Jones?

896
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:15,626
What's the big idea?

897
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:17,127
Let go!

898
01:35:21,466 --> 01:35:23,300
Don't you touch me.

899
01:36:08,054 --> 01:36:09,680
What about Jones?

900
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:11,348
There's no trace yet, sir.

901
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:12,808
Jones is dead.

902
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:17,187
I killed him.

903
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:19,690
He was of no use to us.

904
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:23,193
This girl, however, has certain
value where we're headed.

905
01:36:23,987 --> 01:36:25,696
She'll bring a very good price.

906
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:28,031
Mmm?

907
01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:33,036
Herr Colonel,
that cargo you've taken...

908
01:36:33,121 --> 01:36:34,705
If it's your goal,
go in peace with it,

909
01:36:34,789 --> 01:36:35,789
but leave us the girl.

910
01:36:35,873 --> 01:36:36,957
It would reduce our loss
on this trip.

911
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:39,793
Savage!

912
01:36:39,877 --> 01:36:42,462
You are not in the position
to ask for anything.

913
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:44,965
We will take what we wish.

914
01:36:45,049 --> 01:36:46,508
And then decide whether or not

915
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,510
to blow your ship
from the water.

916
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,389
The girl goes with me.

917
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:55,100
She'll be part
of my compensation.

918
01:36:55,184 --> 01:36:58,186
I'm sure your Fhrer
would approve.

919
01:36:58,271 --> 01:36:59,604
If she fails to please me,

920
01:36:59,689 --> 01:37:01,940
you may do with her as you wish.

921
01:37:02,025 --> 01:37:05,027
I will waste
no more time with her now.

922
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:06,236
Excuse me.

923
01:37:22,337 --> 01:37:23,837
I can't find Mr. Jones, Captain.

924
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:25,505
I've looked everywhere.

925
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:28,008
He's got to be here somewhere.

926
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,259
Look again.

927
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:32,763
- I found him.
- Where?

928
01:37:33,056 --> 01:37:34,097
There.

929
01:40:00,620 --> 01:40:02,370
The altar has been
prepared in accordance

930
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:03,830
with your radio instructions,
sir.

931
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:04,956
Good.

932
01:40:05,082 --> 01:40:06,958
Take the Ark there immediately.

933
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:11,046
Monsieur...

934
01:40:12,715 --> 01:40:14,674
I am uncomfortable
with the thought

935
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:18,845
of this... Jewish ritual.

936
01:40:18,930 --> 01:40:21,473
Are you sure it's necessary?

937
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:23,433
Let me ask you this:

938
01:40:23,684 --> 01:40:27,103
Would you be more comfortable
opening the Ark in Berlin,

939
01:40:27,396 --> 01:40:29,189
for your Fhrer?

940
01:40:29,565 --> 01:40:30,815
Finding out, only then,

941
01:40:30,942 --> 01:40:33,652
if the sacred pieces
of the Covenant are inside?

942
01:40:33,819 --> 01:40:34,861
Knowing, only then,

943
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:36,947
whether you have accomplished
your mission,

944
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:39,908
and obtained the one true Ark?

945
01:42:08,706 --> 01:42:09,748
Hello!

946
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:13,752
Jones.

947
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:16,463
Jones!

948
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:18,381
I'm going to blow up the Ark,
Ren.

949
01:42:24,972 --> 01:42:27,515
Your persistence
surprises even me.

950
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:31,561
You're going to give
mercenaries a bad name.

951
01:42:31,729 --> 01:42:33,438
Dr. Jones...

952
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:38,777
surely you don't think you can
escape from this island.

953
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:41,237
That depends on how reasonable
we're all willing to be.

954
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:42,739
All I want is the girl.

955
01:42:48,245 --> 01:42:49,788
If we refuse?

956
01:42:50,915 --> 01:42:53,083
Then your Fhrer has no prize.

957
01:42:54,251 --> 01:42:55,335
Okay, stand back.

958
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:56,670
All of you, stand back.

959
01:42:56,754 --> 01:42:58,380
Stand back.

960
01:42:58,547 --> 01:43:00,340
Okay, Jones.

961
01:43:00,424 --> 01:43:02,676
You win!

962
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:04,219
Blow it up.

963
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:13,478
Yes, blow it up!

964
01:43:13,562 --> 01:43:15,146
Blow it back to God.

965
01:43:16,273 --> 01:43:17,691
All your life has been spent

966
01:43:17,775 --> 01:43:20,360
in pursuit
of archeological relics.

967
01:43:20,444 --> 01:43:24,114
Inside the Ark are treasures
beyond your wildest aspirations.

968
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:27,158
You want to see it open
as well as I.

969
01:43:29,286 --> 01:43:31,287
Indiana...

970
01:43:31,622 --> 01:43:34,124
we are simply passing
through history.

971
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:37,043
This...

972
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:41,297
This is history.

973
01:43:51,308 --> 01:43:52,976
Do as you will.

974
01:46:28,632 --> 01:46:30,425
Marion, don't look at it.

975
01:46:30,509 --> 01:46:31,634
Shut your eyes, Marion.

976
01:46:31,719 --> 01:46:33,219
Don't look at it,
no matter what happens.

977
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:46,357
Ah...

978
01:47:01,999 --> 01:47:03,666
It's beautiful!

979
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:15,678
Indy?

980
01:47:15,763 --> 01:47:16,804
Don't look, Marion!

981
01:47:16,889 --> 01:47:18,139
Keep your eyes shut!

982
01:48:36,427 --> 01:48:37,593
Marion.

983
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:13,713
You've done your country a
great service, and we thank you.

984
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:17,550
And we trust you found
the settlement satisfactory.

985
01:49:17,634 --> 01:49:18,718
Oh, the money's fine.

986
01:49:18,802 --> 01:49:20,470
The situation's
totally unacceptable.

987
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:22,889
Well, gentlemen,
I guess that just about wraps it up.

988
01:49:22,973 --> 01:49:26,893
Where is the Ark?

989
01:49:26,977 --> 01:49:28,644
I thought we'd settled that.

990
01:49:28,812 --> 01:49:31,439
The Ark is somewhere very safe.

991
01:49:31,523 --> 01:49:32,648
From whom?

992
01:49:32,775 --> 01:49:35,401
The Ark is a source
of unspeakable power

993
01:49:35,486 --> 01:49:37,320
and it has to be researched.

994
01:49:37,404 --> 01:49:40,615
And it will be,
I assure you, Dr. Brody,

995
01:49:40,699 --> 01:49:42,241
Dr. Jones.

996
01:49:42,326 --> 01:49:45,953
We have top men
working on it right now.

997
01:49:47,039 --> 01:49:48,247
Who?

998
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:52,085
Top men.

999
01:49:55,297 --> 01:49:57,548
Hey, what happened?

1000
01:49:57,674 --> 01:49:58,758
You don't look very happy.

1001
01:49:58,842 --> 01:50:01,677
- Fools. Bureaucratic fools.
- What'd they say?

1002
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:04,347
They don't know
what they've got there.

1003
01:50:05,099 --> 01:50:07,058
Well, I know what I've got here.

1004
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:09,685
Come on.

1005
01:50:10,062 --> 01:50:11,521
I'll buy you a drink.

1006
01:50:13,023 --> 01:50:14,774
You know...

1007
01:50:15,192 --> 01:50:16,818
a drink?




1
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:28,680
Mathematicians
won the war.

2
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,319
Mathematicians broke
the Japanese codes-

3
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,680
and built the A-bomb.

4
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,959
Mathematicians...
like you.

5
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,599
The stated goal of the Soviets
is global Communism.

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,799
In medicine or economics,

7
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,040
in technology or space,

8
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:48,840
battle lines are being drawn.

9
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,480
To triumph,
we need results-

10
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:55,239
publishable,
applicable results.

11
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,439
Now who among you
will be the next Morse?

12
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,719
The next Einstein?

13
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:03,640
Who among you will be
the vanguard...

14
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,359
of democracy, freedom,
and discovery?

15
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,879
Today, we bequeath
America's future...

16
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,400
into your able hands.

17
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:16,199
Welcome to Princeton,
gentlemen.

18
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,000
It's not enough Hansen won
the Carnegie Scholarship.

19
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
No, he has to have it
all for himself.

20
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:38,680
It's the first time
the Carnegie Prize...

21
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,639
has been split.
Hansen's all bent.

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,680
Rumor is he's got his sights
set on Wheeler Lab,

23
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,120
the new military
think tank at M.I.T.

24
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,800
They're only taking
one this year.

25
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:49,919
Hansen's used
to being picked first.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,520
Oh, yeah,
he's wasted on math.

27
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,319
He should be running
for president.

28
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,879
There could be
a mathematical explanation...

29
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:06,400
for how bad your tie is.

30
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,439
Thank you.

31
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:16,000
Neilson,
symbol cryptography.

32
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:17,240
Neils here broke
a Jap code.

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,840
Helped rid the world
of fascism.

34
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,039
At least that's what
he tells the girls,
eh, Neils?

35
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,879
The name's Bender.
Atomic physics.

36
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,919
- And you are?
- Am I late?

37
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,879
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Sol.

38
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,919
Oh, good.
Uh, hi.

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,639
- Sol. Richard Sol.
- The burden of genius.

40
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,719
- There he is.
- So many supplicants,
and so little time.

41
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:36,319
Mr. Sol.
How are you, sir?

42
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,639
Ah, Bender.
Nice to see you.

43
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,039
Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
Ah, thank you.

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,439
I'll take another.

45
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,639
Excuse me?

46
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,000
A thousand pardons.
I simply assumed you
were the waiter.

47
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,719
Play nice, Hansen.
Nice is not Hansen's
strong suit.

48
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,560
Honest mistake.

49
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,000
Well, Martin Hansen.

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,800
It is Martin, isn't it?
Why, yes, John, it is.

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,039
I imagine you're getting
quite used to miscalculation.

52
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,159
I've read your pre-prints-

53
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:07,840
both of them.

54
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,759
The one on Nazi ciphers,

55
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,520
and the other one
on non-linear equations,

56
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,360
and I am
supremely confident...

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,759
that there is not
a single seminal...

58
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,439
or innovative idea
in either one of them.

59
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,079
Enjoy your punch.

60
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,920
Gentlemen, meet John Nash,

61
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,600
the mysterious
West Virginia genius.

62
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,160
The other winner
of the distinguished
Carnegie Scholarship.

63
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
Oh, okay. Oh, yeah?

64
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,439
Of course.

65
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,839
Oh, Christ.

66
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,560
The prodigal
roommate arrives.

67
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,279
Roommate?

68
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,920
Oh, God, no.

69
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:19,000
Ugh.

70
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,439
Did you know that having
a hangover is-

71
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,879
is not having enough water
in your body...

72
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,879
to run your Krebs cycles?

73
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,759
Which is exactly
what happens to you...

74
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,319
when you're dying
of thirst.

75
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,240
So, dying
of thirst...

76
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:37,399
would probably feel...

77
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,959
pretty much like
the hangover...

78
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,199
that finally
bloody kills you.

79
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,920
John Nash?

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,800
Hello.

81
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,319
Charles Herman.

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,279
Pleased to meet you.

83
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,160
All right, well done.

84
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,920
Well, it's official.

85
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm almost human again.

86
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,759
Officer, I saw
the driver who hit me.

87
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,439
His name was Johnny Walker.

88
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,439
Whew.

89
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:21,920
Well, I got in last night
in time for...

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,079
English department
cocktails.

91
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,680
Cock was mine,

92
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,680
the tail belonged
to a particularly lovely
young thing...

93
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,240
with a passion for...

94
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,720
D.H. Lawrence.
You're not easily
distracted, are you?

95
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,040
I'm here to work.
Hmmm, are you? Right.

96
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:38,279
I see.
Crikey!

97
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:49,480
Is my roommate a dick?

98
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,040
Hmm?

99
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Listen.

100
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,480
If we can't break the ice,

101
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,680
how about we drown it?

102
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,920
So what's your story?

103
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,959
You the poor kid
that never got to go
to Exeter or Andover?

104
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,480
Despite my privileged
upbringing,

105
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:18,879
I'm actually
quite well-balanced.

106
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,279
I have a chip
on both shoulders.

107
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,079
Maybe you're
just better...

108
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,000
with the old integers
than you are with people.

109
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,879
My first grade teacher,
she told me...

110
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,839
that I was born
with two helpings of brain,

111
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,480
but only half
a helping of heart.

112
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:35,240
Wow!
She sounds lovely!

113
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,720
The truth is that l-

114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,079
I don't like people much.

115
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,199
And they don't
much like me.

116
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,439
But why,

117
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,120
with all your obvious
wit and charm?

118
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,519
Seriously, John.

119
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,519
Mathematics-

120
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,240
Mathematics is
never going to lead you
to a higher truth.

121
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,199
And you know why?

122
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,639
'Cause it's boring.

123
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,240
It's really boring.

124
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,519
You know half these schoolboys
are already published?

125
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,920
I cannot waste time
with these classes...

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,639
and these books.

127
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,480
Memorizing
the weaker assumptions
of lesser mortals!

128
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,560
I need to look through...

129
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,600
to the governing dynamics.

130
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,680
Find a truly original idea.

131
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,639
That's the only way
I'll ever distinguish myself.

132
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,959
It's the only way
that I'll ever-

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,639
Matter.

134
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,960
Yes.

135
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,799
All right,
who's next?

136
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,519
No, I've played enough "Go"
for one day, thank you.

137
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,399
Come on.
I- I hate this game.

138
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,039
Cowards, all of you!

139
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,000
None of you rise
to meet my challenge?

140
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,600
Come on, Bender.
Whoever wins,

141
00:08:49,639 --> 00:08:51,600
Sol does his laundry
all semester.

142
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,279
Does that seem unfair
to anyone else?
Not at all.

143
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,559
- Look at him.
- Nash!

144
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,159
Taking a reverse
constitutional?

145
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,000
I'm hoping to extract
an algorithm...

146
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,919
to define
their movement.

147
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,200
Oh.
Psycho.

148
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,000
Hey, Nash, I thought
you dropped out.

149
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:13,600
You ever going
to go to class or-

150
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:15,919
Classes will
dull your mind.

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,320
Destroy the potential
for authentic creativity.

152
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,240
Oh, oh, I didn't
know that.

153
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Nash is going to stun us all
with his genius.

154
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:24,919
Which is another way
of saying...

155
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,879
he doesn't have
the nerve to compete.

156
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,039
You scared?

157
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,480
Terrified.

158
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,879
Mortified.
Petrified.

159
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,559
Stupefied... by you.

160
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,080
No starch.

161
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,039
Pressed and folded.

162
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:43,759
Let me ask
you something, John.

163
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,600
Be my guest, Martin.

164
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:47,360
Bender and Sol here
correctly completed...

165
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,399
Allen's proof
of Peyrot's Conjecture.

166
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,440
Adequate work...

167
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,120
without innovation.

168
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,879
Oh. I'm flattered.
You flattered?

169
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,080
Flattered.

170
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,240
And I've got
two weapons briefs...

171
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,600
under security review
by the D.O.D.

172
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,759
Derivative drivel.

173
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,519
But Nash achievements:

174
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,840
zero.

175
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,639
I'm a patient man, Martin.
Is there an actual
question coming?

176
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,960
What if you never come up
with your original idea?

177
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,919
Huh?

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
How will it feel
when I'm chosen
for Wheeler...

179
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,440
and you're not?

180
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,960
What if you lose?

181
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,600
Ah, there it is.

182
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,639
You should not have won.

183
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,080
Hmmm.

184
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,600
I had the first move,
my-my play was perfect.

185
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,120
The hubris
of the defeated.

186
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,320
The game is flawed.

187
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,960
Gentlemen,
the great John Nash.

188
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,240
You've been in here
for two days.

189
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,960
You know Hansen's
just published another paper?

190
00:11:08,039 --> 00:11:10,120
I can't even find a topic
for my doctorate.

191
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,120
Well, on the bright side,
you've invented window art.

192
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,840
This is a group
playing touch football.

193
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,120
This is a cluster of pigeons
fighting over bread crumbs.

194
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,519
And this here is a woman
who is chasing a man
who stole her purse.

195
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,600
John, you watched
a mugging.

196
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,039
That's weird.

197
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,679
In competitive behavior
someone always loses.

198
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,320
Well, my niece knows that,
John, and she's about this high.

199
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,600
See, if I could derive
an equilibrium...

200
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,120
where prevalence is
a non-singular event,

201
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,440
where nobody loses,

202
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,440
can you imagine the effect
that would have...

203
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,279
on conflict scenarios,
and arms negotiations...
When did you last eat?

204
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,720
When did you last eat?
...currency exchange?

205
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,440
You know, food.

206
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:01,360
You have no respect
for cognitive reverie,
you know that?

207
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,320
Yes. But pizza-

208
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,159
Now, pizza I have
enormous respect for.

209
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,200
And of course beer.

210
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,960
I have respect for beer.

211
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,639
I have respect for beer!

212
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,039
Good evening, Neils.Hey, Nash.

213
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,960
Who's winning? You or you?

214
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,600
Evening, Nash.Hey, guys.

215
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,480
Hey, Nash.

216
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,159
He's looking
at you for sure.

217
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,279
Hey, Nash.

218
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,879
Neils is trying
to get your attention.

219
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:51,200
You're joking. Oh, no.

220
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,600
Go with God.
Come back a man.

221
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,559
Fortune favors the brave.
Bombs away.

222
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,440
Gentlemen, might I remind you
that my odds of success...

223
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,399
dramatically improve
with each attempt.

224
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,600
This is going
to be classic.

225
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,840
Maybe you want
to buy me a drink.

226
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,759
I don't exactly know
what I'm required to say...

227
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,480
in order for you
to have intercourse with me,

228
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,080
but could we assume
that I said all that?

229
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:07,919
Essentially we're talking
about fluid exchange, right?

230
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,799
So, could we just
go straight to the sex?

231
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:12,679
Oh, that was sweet.

232
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,559
Have a nice night,
asshole!

233
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,720
Ladies, wait!

234
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,440
l-

235
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,559
I especially liked
the bit about fluid exchange.

236
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,639
It was really charming.

237
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,200
Walk with me, John.

238
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,399
I've been meaning
to talk with you.

239
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,279
The faculty is completing
mid-year reviews.

240
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,720
We're deciding which placement
applications to support.

241
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,759
Wheeler, sir.
That would be
my first choice.

242
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,240
And actually,
I don't really have
a second choice, sir.

243
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,360
John, your fellows
have attended classes.

244
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:49,279
They've written papers.
They've published.

245
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,039
I'm still searching, sir,
for my-

246
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,759
Your original idea, I know.
Governing dynamics, sir.

247
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:55,440
It's very clever, John,
but I'm afraid...

248
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,799
it's just not nearly
good enough.

249
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,440
May l?
Thank you.

250
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,080
I've been working
on manifold embedding.

251
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,159
My bargaining stratagems
are starting to show
some promise.

252
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,799
If you could just
arrange another meeting,

253
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
if you'd be kind enough,
with Professor Einstein-

254
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,799
I've repeatedly asked
you for that.
Now, John.

255
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,240
I'd be able to show him
my revisions on his-
John? John.

256
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,720
Do you see what they're
doing in there?

257
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:24,360
Congratulations. Thank you so much.

258
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,159
Congratulations,
Professor Max.

259
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,519
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.

260
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,879
It's the pens.

261
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,120
Reserved for a member
of the department...

262
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,000
that makes the achievement
of a lifetime.

263
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:39,639
Now, what do you see, John?

264
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,320
Recognition.

265
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,039
Well done, Professor.
Well done.

266
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,440
Well, try seeing
accomplishment.

267
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,240
Is there a difference?

268
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,559
John,

269
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,759
you haven't focused.

270
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,799
I'm sorry,
but up to this point,

271
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,440
your record doesn't warrant
any placement at all.

272
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,279
Good day.

273
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,159
And my compliments
to you, sir.

274
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
Thank you so much.

275
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,039
I can't see it.

276
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:45,639
- Aah!
-Jesus Christ, John.

277
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,000
I can't fail.

278
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:50,840
This is all I am.
Come on, let's go out.

279
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:52,799
I got to get
something done.
John!

280
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,600
- I can't keep
staring into space.
-John, enough!

281
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,080
Got to face the wall,
follow their rules,
read their books,

282
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,600
You want to do
some damage? Fine-

283
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:01,679
But don't mess around.
do their classes.

284
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,759
Come on!
Go on, bust your head!

285
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,440
Kill yourself.

286
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,759
Don't do it.
Don't mess around.

287
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,519
Bust your head!
Go on,

288
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,440
bust that worthless head
wide open.

289
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:13,519
Goddamn it, Charles!
What the hell is your problem?!

290
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:19,319
It's not my problem.

291
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,480
And it's not your problem.

292
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,599
It's their problem.

293
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,640
Your answer isn't
face the wall.

294
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,960
It's out there...

295
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,559
where you've been working.

296
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,319
That was heavy.

297
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,839
That Isaac Newton fellow
was right.

298
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,640
He was onto something.
Clever boy.

299
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,759
Don't worry, that's mine.
I'll come and get it in a minute.

300
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,079
Oh, God.

301
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,559
Incoming, gentlemen.Ay-yi-yi.

302
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,039
Deep breaths.

303
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:24,759
Nash, you might
want to stop...

304
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:27,920
shuffling your papers
for five seconds.

305
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,000
I will not buy
you gentlemen beer.

306
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:35,519
Oh, we're not here
for beer, my friend.

307
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,400
Oh.

308
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,039
Does anyone else feel
she should be moving
in slow motion?

309
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,640
Will she want
a large wedding, ya think?

310
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,119
Shall we say swords,
gentlemen?

311
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,039
Pistols at dawn?
Have you remembered nothing?

312
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,319
Recall the lessons
of Adam Smith,

313
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,279
the father
of modern economics.

314
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,079
"In competition...

315
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,720
individual ambition
serves the common good."

316
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,000
- Exactly.
- Every man for himself, gentlemen.

317
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:03,960
And those who strike out
are stuck with her friends.

318
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,799
I'm not gonna strike out.

319
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,240
You can lead a blonde to water,
but you can't make her drink.

320
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:10,240
- I don't think he said that.
- Nobody move-

321
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:12,279
She's looking over here.
She's looking at Nash.

322
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,920
Oh, God. He may have
the upper hand now,

323
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,079
but wait until he
opens his mouth.

324
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,200
Remember the last time?

325
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,400
Oh, yes, that was one
for the history books.

326
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,839
- Adam Smith needs revision.
- What are you talking about?

327
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,440
If we all go for the blonde,

328
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,279
we block each other.

329
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,480
Not a single one of us
is gonna get her.

330
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,079
So then we go
for her friends,

331
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,839
but they will all
give us the cold shoulder...

332
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,359
because nobody likes
to be second choice.

333
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,240
Well, what if no one goes
for the blonde?

334
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:57,920
We don't get
in each other's way,

335
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:00,799
and we don't insult
the other girls.

336
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:04,000
That's the only way we win.

337
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,440
That's the only
way we all get laid.

338
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,960
Adam Smith said...

339
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,359
the best result comes...

340
00:20:16,359 --> 00:20:18,559
from everyone
in the group doing...

341
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:20,079
what's best
for himself, right?

342
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,079
That's what he
said, right?

343
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:21,960
Right.
Incomplete.

344
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Incomplete, okay?

345
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,559
Because the best result
will come...

346
00:20:26,599 --> 00:20:29,200
from everyone
in the group...

347
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:31,839
doing what's best
for himself...

348
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,599
and the group.

349
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,799
Nash, if this is some way
for you to get the blonde
on your own,

350
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:38,480
you can go to hell.
Governing dynamics.

351
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:41,440
Governing dynamics.
Adam Smith...

352
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,119
was wrong.

353
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,839
Oh, here we go. Careful, careful.

354
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,960
Thank you.

355
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,000
"C" of "S" equals "C" of "T."

356
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,720
You do realize this
flies in the face...

357
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,440
of a 1 50 years
of economic theory?
Yes, I do, sir.

358
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:10,319
That's rather presumptuous,
don't you think?

359
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,160
It is, sir.

360
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,599
Well, Mr. Nash,

361
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,480
with a breakthrough
of this magnitude,

362
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:27,440
I'm confident you will get
any placement you like.

363
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:35,200
Wheeler Labs,

364
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,720
they'll ask you to recommend
two team members.

365
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,319
Yes!

366
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:44,279
Stills and Frank
are excellent choices.

367
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:46,160
Sol and Bender, sir.

368
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,759
Sol and Bender are
extraordinary mathematicians.

369
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,759
Has it occurred to you
that Sol and Bender...

370
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,319
might have plans
of their own?

371
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,640
We made it!

372
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,559
Wheeler, we made it!

373
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:06,079
Cheers, cheers, cheers!
To- Oh! Oh!

374
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:08,599
Okay, awkward moment,
gentlemen.

375
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,799
Umm...

376
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:31,680
Hmm.

377
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,200
Governing dynamics.

378
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:38,200
Congratulations, John.
Thanks.

379
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,119
Toast!
To Wheeler Labs!

380
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,160
To Wheeler!

381
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,599
General, the analyst
from Wheeler Lab is here.

382
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,359
Dr. Nash, your coat?

383
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,359
Thank you, sir.

384
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,240
Doctor. General, this is
Wheeler team leader
Dr. John Nash.

385
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,000
Glad you could
come, Doctor.

386
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,440
Hello.

387
00:24:18,519 --> 00:24:20,319
Right this way.

388
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:24,000
We've been intercepting
radio transmissions
from Moscow.

389
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,440
The computer can't
detect a pattern,

390
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,160
but I'm sure
it's code.

391
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,440
Why is that, General?

392
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,920
Ever just know
something, Dr. Nash?

393
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,960
Constantly.

394
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,200
We've developed several ciphers.

395
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:45,119
If you'd like to review
our preliminary data...

396
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,079
Doctor?
6-7-3-7,

397
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:52,000
0-3-6...

398
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:06,960
8-4-9-4.

399
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,279
9-1 -4-0-3-4.

400
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
I need a map.

401
00:25:58,599 --> 00:26:00,039
46-1 3-08,

402
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:02,599
67-46-90.

403
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:06,599
Starkey Corners, Maine.

404
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,400
48-03-01 ,

405
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,720
91 -26-35.

406
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,559
Prairie Portage,
Minnesota.

407
00:26:14,599 --> 00:26:17,480
These are latitudes
and longitudes.

408
00:26:17,559 --> 00:26:19,200
There are a least 1 0 others.

409
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,640
They appear to be routing orders
across the border into the U.S.

410
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,920
Extraordinary.

411
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,279
Gentlemen, we need
to move on this.

412
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,079
Who's Big Brother?
You've done your country
a great service, son.

413
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,279
- Captain!
- Yes, sir.

414
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:40,640
Accompany Dr. Nash.

415
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,519
What are the Russians
moving, General?

416
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,119
Captain Rogers
will escort you...

417
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,920
to the unrestricted
area, Doctor.

418
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,559
Thank you.

419
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,920
Dr. Nash, follow me, please.

420
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:01,000
None of those who have
said they don't like the method...

421
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,880
have told us
any other method they could use
that would be effective.

422
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,960
And when you hear... It's Dr. Nash.

423
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,920
All right.

424
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,599
Thank you, sir.
Home run at the Pentagon?

425
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,200
Have they actually
taken the word "classified"

426
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,480
out of the dictionary?

427
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,000
Oh, hi.
The air conditioning
broke again.

428
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,039
How am I supposed to be
in here saving the world...

429
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:34,839
if I'm melting?
Our hearts go
out to you.

430
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,799
You know, two trips
to the Pentagon in four years.

431
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,039
That's two more
than we've had.

432
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:40,759
It gets better,
John.

433
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:43,279
Just got our latest
scintillating assignment.

434
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:45,200
You know, the Russians
have the H-bomb,

435
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,279
the Nazis are repatriating
South America,

436
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,519
the Chinese have
a standing army of 2.8 million,

437
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:53,960
and I am doing
stress tests on a dam.

438
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,680
You made the cover
of Fortune... again.

439
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,240
Please note the use
of the word "you," not "we."

440
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:01,680
That was supposed
to be just me.

441
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,039
Oh.

442
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,200
So not only do they rob me
of the Fields Medal,

443
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,160
now they put me on the cover
of Fortune magazine...

444
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,599
with these hacks,
these scholars of trivia.

445
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,200
John, exactly what's
the difference...

446
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,920
between genius
and most genius?

447
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,680
Quite a lot.

448
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,480
He's your son.

449
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:21,319
Anyway, you've got
1 0 minutes.

450
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,039
I've always got 1 0 minutes.

451
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:25,279
Before your new class?

452
00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:32,519
Can I not get a note
from a doctor or something?

453
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:36,000
You are a doctor, John,
and no.

454
00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:39,240
Now, come on, you know the drill,
we get these beautiful facilities,

455
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,319
M.I. T. gets America's
great minds of today...

456
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:43,359
teaching America's
great minds of tomorrow.

457
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,880
Poor bastards.

458
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,920
Now, have a nice
day at school.

459
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,359
The bell's ringing.

460
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,680
The eager young minds
of tomorrow.

461
00:29:20,839 --> 00:29:22,400
Can we leave one open,
Professor?

462
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,839
It's really hot, sir.

463
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,400
Your comfort comes second...

464
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
to my ability
to hear my own voice.

465
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,960
Personally,

466
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,880
I think this class will be
a waste... of your-

467
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,720
and what is
infinitely worse-

468
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,079
my time.

469
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,880
However, here we are.

470
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,599
So you may attend or not.

471
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,759
You may complete
your assignments
at your whim.

472
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:57,960
We have begun.

473
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,960
Miss.

474
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:06,480
Excuse me!

475
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:08,920
Excuse me!
Hey, hey!

476
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,680
Hi!

477
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:13,559
Um, we have
a little problem.

478
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,599
It's extremely hot in here
with the windows closed...

479
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,160
and extremely noisy
with them open.

480
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,480
So, I was wondering
if there was any way you could,

481
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:23,279
I don't know,
maybe work someplace else...

482
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:25,000
for about 45minutes?

483
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,799
- Not a problem.
- Thank you so much!

484
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,720
At a break!
Got it!

485
00:30:29,799 --> 00:30:33,400
Let's go. Clean it up a little bit.

486
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,359
As you will find
in multivariable calculus,

487
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,119
there is often...

488
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,799
a number of solutions
for any given problem.

489
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,559
As I was saying,
this problem here...

490
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,240
will take some of you
many months to solve.

491
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,000
For others among you,

492
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,319
it will take you the term
of your natural lives.

493
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,279
Professor Nash.

494
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,920
William Parcher.

495
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,359
Big Brother...
at your service.

496
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,920
What can I do
for the Department of Defense?

497
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,599
- Are you here to give me a raise?
- Let's take a walk.

498
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,640
Impressive work
at the Pentagon.
Yes, it was.

499
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,039
Oppenheimer used to say,

500
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,519
"Genius sees the answer
before the question."

501
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:47,440
You knew Oppenheimer?

502
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,079
His project was
under my supervision.

503
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,039
Which project?

504
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,599
That project.

505
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,279
It's not that simple,
you know?

506
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,920
Well, you ended
the war.

507
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,440
We incinerated 1 50,000 people
in a heartbeat.

508
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,279
Great deeds come
at great cost, Mr. Parcher.

509
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,839
Well, conviction,
it turns out,

510
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,039
is a luxury of those
on the sidelines, Mr. Nash.

511
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,680
I'll try
and keep that in mind.

512
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,480
So, John, no family,

513
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,319
no close friends-

514
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,839
Why is that?

515
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,799
I like to think it's
because I'm a lone wolf.

516
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,920
But mainly it's because
people don't like me.

517
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,759
Well, there are
certain endeavors...

518
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:35,559
where your lack
of personal connection...

519
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,599
would be considered
an advantage.

520
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,599
This is a secure area.
They know me.

521
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,720
Have you ever
been here?

522
00:32:46,759 --> 00:32:48,519
We were told during
our initial briefing...

523
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,480
that these warehouses
were abandoned.

524
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:52,640
That's not
precisely accurate.

525
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,960
By telling you
what I'm about to tell you,

526
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:31,680
I am increasing
your security clearance...

527
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,319
to top secret.

528
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,880
Disclosure of secure information
can result in imprisonment.

529
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,240
Get it?

530
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,200
What operation?

531
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:47,519
Those are a good idea.

532
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:54,720
This factory is in Berlin.
We seized it
at the end of the war.

533
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:56,440
Nazi engineers
were attempting...

534
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:59,000
to build a portable
atomic bomb.

535
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:01,599
The Soviets reached
this facility before we did,

536
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,240
and we lost the damn thing.

537
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,519
The routing orders
at the Pentagon,

538
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,679
they were about this,
weren't they?

539
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,400
The Soviets aren't
as unified as people believe.

540
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,920
A faction of the Red Army
calling itself Novaya Svobga,

541
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,239
"the New Freedom,"
has control of the bomb...

542
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,800
and intends to detonate it
on U.S. soil.

543
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,559
Their plan is to incur
maximum civilian casualties.

544
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,119
Man is capable of as much atrocity
as he has imagination.

545
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,840
New Freedom has sleeper agents
here in the U.S.

546
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,719
McCarthy is an idiot,

547
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,760
but unfortunately
that doesn't make him wrong.

548
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,559
New Freedom communicates
to its agents...

549
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:50,360
through codes imbedded
in newspapers and magazines,

550
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,960
and that's
where you come in.

551
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:56,119
You see, John,
what distinguishes you...

552
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,880
is that you are,

553
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,480
quite simply,

554
00:34:59,559 --> 00:35:03,159
the best natural code-breaker
I have ever seen.

555
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,360
What exactly is it
that you would like me to do?

556
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:19,079
Commit this list
of periodicals to memory.

557
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:24,039
Scan each new issue,
find any hidden codes,

558
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,719
decipher them.

559
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:29,760
Place your chin
on the chin rest.

560
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,440
Stare into the light.
Pulse 88, regular.

561
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,199
Okay, this may be
a little uncomfortable.

562
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,760
That's got
a little zap to it,
doesn't it?

563
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,920
He just implanted
a radium diode.

564
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
Don't worry, it's safe.

565
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,719
The isotope decays
predictably.

566
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,840
As a result,
these numbers change overtime.

567
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,159
They're the access codes
to your drop spot.

568
00:35:58,679 --> 00:36:01,880
So what am I now,
a spy?

569
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:15,519
- Come.

570
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:21,760
Boy, you must be
really important.

571
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:31,519
It's all right, Mike.

572
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,760
What are you
working on?

573
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,599
Classified.

574
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,119
Everyone waited half an hour.

575
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:52,159
For?
Class.

576
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:54,239
You missed class today.

577
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,920
Oh. I suspect that...

578
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,159
nobody missed me.

579
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,239
The problem that you left
on the board-

580
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,320
I solved it.

581
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,519
Oh, no you didn't.
You didn't even look.

582
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:14,440
I never said
that the vector fields
were rational functions.

583
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,599
Your solution is elegant.

584
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:25,239
Though on this
particular occasion,

585
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:28,159
ultimately incorrect.

586
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,159
- You're still here.
- I'm still here.

587
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:54,599
Why?

588
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:58,039
I'm wondering,
Professor Nash,

589
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,440
if I can ask you to dinner.

590
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,400
You do eat, don't you?

591
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,800
Oh, on occasion, yeah.

592
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,400
Table for one.
Prometheus alone
chained to the rock...

593
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,679
with the bird
circling overhead,
you know how it is.

594
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:19,719
No, I expect
that you wouldn't-

595
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,440
you wouldn't know, uh-

596
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:26,239
If you leave your address
with my office,

597
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:29,280
I'll pick you up
Friday at 8:00...

598
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,800
and we'll eat.

599
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,079
One more thing.
Do you have a name,

600
00:38:41,159 --> 00:38:43,519
or should I just
keep calling you "Miss"?

601
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,559
Governor,

602
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:49,039
may I present-
Miss Alicia Larde.

603
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,880
Miss Alicia Larde.
How do you do?

604
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,840
Professor, please.
You and the governor.

605
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,480
Wait, one second.
I'm sorry.

606
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,440
I want a copy of this.

607
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,639
First big date and all,
you know.

608
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,639
So, you boys need
to look good.

609
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,800
Which is not a state
you find yourselves in...

610
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,880
altogether naturally.

611
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,280
There. Better.

612
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,239
- I'm surprising him.
- You just keep on surprising him.

613
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,039
Professor.

614
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:41,039
God must be a painter.

615
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:44,320
Why else would we
have so many colors?

616
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,280
So you're a painter?

617
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,960
That's not actually
what I said,

618
00:39:52,039 --> 00:39:54,679
but, yes-

619
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,800
I am.

620
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,000
Here.

621
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,880
Me.

622
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,400
Your date?

623
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,960
Practice human interaction
and social comportment.

624
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,039
That's a plan.

625
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,039
Champagne would be lovely.

626
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:26,239
I'll be outside.

627
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,320
I will get the champagne.

628
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,159
Oh, thank you.

629
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,800
Thank you for that.

630
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,119
No, keep it.

631
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:46,280
I believe in deciding things
will be good luck.

632
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,119
Do you?

633
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:50,039
No.

634
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,000
I don't believe in luck.

635
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:58,639
But I do believe
in assigning value to things.

636
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:01,360
Oh.

637
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:10,880
I once tried
to count them all.

638
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,480
I actually made it
to 4,348.

639
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,760
You are exceptionally odd.

640
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,559
I bet you're very
popular with the girls.

641
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:31,039
A pair of odd ducks, then.

642
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:33,599
Mmm.

643
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,000
Pick a shape.

644
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,920
What?

645
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,039
Pick a shape.
An animal-
anything.

646
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,920
Okay.

647
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,400
An umbrella.

648
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:29,679
Do it again.

649
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,280
Do it again.
All right.

650
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,960
What would you like?
Do, uh...

651
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,440
an octopus.

652
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:20,480
You don't talk much, do you?

653
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:23,199
I can't talk to you
about my work, Alicia.

654
00:45:23,239 --> 00:45:25,000
I don't mean work.

655
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,280
I find that polishing
my interactions...

656
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:35,199
in order to make
them sociable requires
a tremendous effort.

657
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,280
I have
a tendency to expedite
information flow...

658
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:43,760
by being direct.

659
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:47,119
I often don't get
a pleasant result.

660
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:48,400
Try me.

661
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,000
All right.

662
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,400
I find you attractive.

663
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:00,480
Your aggressive
moves towards me...

664
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,239
indicate that you
feel the same way.

665
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,000
But still,
ritual requires that we...

666
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:07,679
continue with a number
of platonic activities...

667
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,920
before we have sex.

668
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,119
I am proceeding
with those activities,

669
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:15,079
but in point
of actual fact,

670
00:46:15,159 --> 00:46:19,079
all I really want to do
is have intercourse with you
as soon as possible.

671
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:23,199
Are you gonna
slap me now?

672
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,800
How was that result?

673
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:07,000
What are you doing?

674
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:13,800
I'm attempting to isolate
patterned reoccurrences...

675
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,440
within periodicals
over time. And you?

676
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:18,599
You talk funny,
Mr. Nash.

677
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:24,519
Do I know you?

678
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:26,840
My uncle says
you're very smart...

679
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,519
but not very nice,

680
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:30,599
so I shouldn't pay no mind
if you're mean to me.

681
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:32,599
And who might
your uncle be?

682
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:35,039
The prodigal roommate...

683
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:36,920
returns.

684
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:42,840
Come here.
Charles, Charles, Charles.

685
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,920
My sister...

686
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:52,199
got herself killed
in a car crash.

687
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:54,760
Not too far now,
Marcee!

688
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,760
Her cowboy husband
was too drunk...

689
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,199
to know that he was
too drunk to drive.

690
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,599
So, I took her in.

691
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,079
She's so small.
She's young, John.
That's how they come.

692
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:11,079
I'm at Harvard...

693
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:13,760
doing the great
author's workshop.

694
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,800
D.H. bloody Lawrence.

695
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:17,920
I really do think you should
buy yourself a new book.

696
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:22,960
Well, I've been reading
a lot about you.

697
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,079
How are you, John?

698
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:29,079
At first all my work
here was trivial,

699
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:31,679
but a new assignment
came up and-

700
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,679
I can't really tell you
any details.

701
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,960
Top secret?
Black bag? Black ops?

702
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,079
Something like that.

703
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:42,719
And, uh...
Yes?

704
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,639
Well, l- I met a girl.

705
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:47,519
No! A human girl?
Homo sapiens.

706
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:49,639
A biped?
Yup. And contrary
to all probabilities,

707
00:48:49,719 --> 00:48:51,599
she finds me attractive
on a number of different levels.

708
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:52,960
Really?

709
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,119
God, that's wonderful.

710
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,880
There's no accounting
for taste, is there?

711
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,880
Should I marry her?

712
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,840
Oh, God. Right.

713
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,039
I mean, everything's
going well.

714
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:09,599
The job is fine.
I have enough money.

715
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:11,320
It all seems to add up.

716
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,159
But how do you know
for sure?

717
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:19,320
Nothing's ever for sure, John.

718
00:49:19,400 --> 00:49:21,360
That's the only
sure thing I do know.

719
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:30,000
Good evening.

720
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:38,400
Alicia, please don't
be angry.

721
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,920
I just lost track
of time at work...

722
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
again.
Mm-hmm.

723
00:49:43,079 --> 00:49:45,400
I'm sorry.

724
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:48,320
I didn't have time
to wrap it.

725
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,760
Happy birthday.

726
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,840
The refractive faces
of the glass, you see,

727
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,679
they create
a full wavelength dispersal,

728
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,639
so if you look inside it,
you can see-

729
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,239
- Every possible color.
- Every possible color.

730
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,679
Yeah.

731
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:07,039
Remember you said that time
God must be a painter,

732
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:09,760
because of all the colors,
at the governor's house?

733
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,559
you said that.

734
00:50:11,639 --> 00:50:13,719
I didn't think
you were listening.

735
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,079
I'm always listening.

736
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,679
It's beautiful.

737
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,840
Alicia, does our
relationship warrant
long-term commitment?

738
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:46,599
'Cause I need
some kind of proof,

739
00:50:46,679 --> 00:50:48,800
some kind of verifiable,
empirical data.

740
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,239
I'm sorry,
just give me a moment...

741
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:01,559
to redefine
my girlish notions
of romance.

742
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:06,840
A proof?

743
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,440
Verifiable data.

744
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:11,039
Um... okay.

745
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:16,480
Well, how big
is the universe?

746
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,079
Infinite.

747
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:19,360
How do you know?

748
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,119
I know because
all the data indicate it.

749
00:51:21,159 --> 00:51:22,840
But it hasn't
been proven yet?
No.

750
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,639
You haven't seen it.
How do you know for sure?

751
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:27,559
I don't, I just believe it.

752
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:29,119
Mmm.

753
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:32,800
It's the same
with love, I guess.

754
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:41,639
Now,

755
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:43,760
the part that
you don't know...

756
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,559
is if I want
to marry you.

757
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:10,760
Smile for the camera!

758
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,239
Well done!

759
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:17,159
Oh, sweet pea.

760
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:18,880
I love you.
Congratulations.

761
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,639
Hey, Sol.

762
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,840
You look beautiful.

763
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,039
Hi, how are you?

764
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,679
Hey, Sol.

765
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,639
Bye bye. Bye, now.

766
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:35,639
- Bye!
- Bye!

767
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:37,280
Be safe!

768
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:07,000
Get in.
Hurry.

769
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,079
They're following us.

770
00:53:16,519 --> 00:53:18,039
Who's-
Who's following us?

771
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,679
The drop's been
compromised.

772
00:53:19,719 --> 00:53:21,559
- Get down!

773
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:24,559
- Stay down.

774
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:53,280
- Here, take this.
- I ain't shooting anybody.

775
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,960
- Take the goddamn gun!
- No!

776
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:57,559
Son of a-

777
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:15,519
You stay back.
Don't move.

778
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:02,719
John?

779
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:10,079
Hi.

780
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,039
Where were you?

781
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:19,719
S-Sol-
Yeah, I talked to Sol.

782
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,320
He said you left
the office hours ago.

783
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,159
Why didn't you
call me?

784
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,960
Are you all right?

785
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,519
Honey?

786
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:46,559
John...

787
00:55:46,599 --> 00:55:49,559
Please, talk to me.
Tell me what happened.

788
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:52,800
John,
open the door.

789
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:57,280
Come on, open the door!
Let me in!

790
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:59,239
Talk to me!

791
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:01,719
John!

792
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,719
Open the door!

793
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,360
Watch for cars, kids.

794
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:05,079
John.

795
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:07,480
William.

796
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:09,760
This is not what
I signed on for.

797
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,719
Every time
a car backfires
or a door slams-

798
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,440
I understand-
better than you
could possibly imagine.

799
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:27,159
You need
to calm down, John.

800
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:29,760
Now listen to me.
We're closing in
on the bomb,

801
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,119
in large part
due to your work.

802
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,719
Now don't you think your fear
is a small price to pay?

803
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:37,480
William, my circumstance
has changed.

804
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:39,800
Alicia's pregnant.

805
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:50,719
I told you attachments
were dangerous.

806
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:53,639
You chose to marry
the girl.

807
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:56,159
I did nothing
to prevent it.

808
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:01,159
The best way to ensure
everybody's safety...

809
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:03,320
is for you to continue
your work.

810
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,880
Well, I'll just quit.

811
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,679
You won't.

812
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:09,280
Why would I not?

813
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:12,320
Because I keep the Russians
from knowing you work for us.

814
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,039
You quit
working for me,

815
00:58:15,079 --> 00:58:17,679
I quit working for you.

816
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,360
Parcher!

817
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,840
Parcher!

818
00:58:37,159 --> 00:58:39,159
John, you all right?

819
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:00,440
John?

820
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:02,039
Turn it off!
Turn off the light!

821
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:07,239
Why would you
do that?

822
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,920
Why would you
turn the light on?

823
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,400
What is wrong
with you?

824
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:12,280
You have to go
to your sister's.

825
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,880
I left the car out the back.
You take Commonwealth.

826
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,880
No side streets,
you stay where it's crowded.
John, I'm not going anywhere!

827
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,280
When you get to your sister's,
you wait for me to call you.

828
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,360
No, I'm not going.
Just get your things.

829
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,880
I'm not leaving-
Stop! Stop it!

830
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:28,440
Please, Alicia.

831
00:59:28,519 --> 00:59:31,639
I'll explain
when I can.

832
01:00:16,199 --> 01:00:18,039
Uncle John!

833
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,119
Uncle John!

834
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,559
- Hey, baby girl!

835
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:28,320
Wow, someone
needed a hug!

836
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,880
I saw you on the slate
and I thought to myself,

837
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,079
"How can I miss seeing
a guest lecture...

838
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:35,199
by the inimitable
John Nash?"

839
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:40,000
What's wrong?

840
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:44,960
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.

841
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,760
Well, now you tell me,
what is it?

842
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,960
Professor Nash!

843
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,159
Welcome!

844
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,519
After?

845
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,880
So, we see that
the- the zeroes,

846
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,440
of the Reimann
Zeta function,

847
01:01:06,519 --> 01:01:09,119
correspond
to singularities...

848
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:12,320
in space-time,

849
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,159
singularities
in space-time-

850
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:20,679
and conventional
number theory...

851
01:01:22,599 --> 01:01:26,880
It breaks down in the face
of relativistic exploration.

852
01:01:41,639 --> 01:01:43,639
Sometimes
our expectations...

853
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:46,039
are betrayed
by the numbers.

854
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,000
Variables are impossible
to assign any...

855
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,519
rational value.

856
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:12,599
Professor Nash!

857
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,480
- Hold it!
- Professor Nash?

858
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,519
Professor Nash,

859
01:02:28,599 --> 01:02:31,880
let's avoid a scene, shall we?

860
01:02:31,960 --> 01:02:33,880
What do you want?

861
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,480
My name is Rosen,

862
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,440
Dr. Rosen.
I'm a psychiatrist.

863
01:02:38,519 --> 01:02:41,480
Forgive me
if I don't seem
persuaded.

864
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:44,119
I'd like you
to come with me, John.

865
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:46,920
Just for a chat.

866
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:49,880
It appears I have
no choice.

867
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,320
Oh-hh!

868
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:02,639
Help me!
Somebody!

869
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:07,960
Somebody!

870
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:11,360
Help me!
Get off me!

871
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:13,639
I know who you are!
I know who you are!

872
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:15,320
No, no, no,
no, don't.

873
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,159
Charles, they're Russians!
Charles, they're Russians!

874
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:19,000
Call somebody!
Call somebody, Charles!

875
01:03:19,079 --> 01:03:20,480
They're Russians!
Steady the leg.

876
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:22,239
Get away from me.

877
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:24,440
Stay away from me!

878
01:03:29,159 --> 01:03:31,559
There, now.

879
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:33,400
All better.

880
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,039
Everything's
all right here.

881
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:42,800
Watch your head.

882
01:04:11,639 --> 01:04:13,880
John?

883
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:16,840
Can you hear me?

884
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:32,000
Go easy now.

885
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:34,840
Thorazine takes
a little while
to wear off.

886
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,000
Sorry about
the restraints.

887
01:04:40,039 --> 01:04:42,519
You've got one hell
of a right hook.

888
01:04:42,599 --> 01:04:45,599
Where am l?

889
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:47,239
Ahem.

890
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,559
MacArthur
Psychiatric Hospital.

891
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:55,159
I find that
highly unlikely.

892
01:04:55,239 --> 01:04:56,639
You made
a mistake.

893
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:00,480
My work is non-military
in application.

894
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:02,920
Which work
is that, John?

895
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,719
I don't know
anything.

896
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,239
There's no good
in keeping secrets, you know.

897
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:26,960
Charles?

898
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:29,800
Charles?

899
01:05:31,480 --> 01:05:33,320
I didn't mean to get you
involved in this.

900
01:05:35,559 --> 01:05:37,360
I'm- I'm sorry.

901
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:43,800
Charles?

902
01:05:50,679 --> 01:05:52,039
The prodigal roommate
revealed.

903
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:57,880
"Saw my name
on the lecture slate."

904
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,000
You lying son
of a bitch!

905
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:02,679
Who are you talking to?
Tell me who you see.

906
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,239
How do you say,
"Charles Herman" in Russian?

907
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,679
How do you say it
in Russian?

908
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,920
There's no one there, John.
There's no one there.

909
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,440
He's right there.
He's right there.

910
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:16,480
Stop!
I don't know anything!

911
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:19,119
Stop!
l- I don't know anything!

912
01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:23,199
My name is John Nash.

913
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:24,800
I'm being held
against my will.

914
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,320
Somebody call
the Department of Defense.

915
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,119
My name is John Nash.

916
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:31,559
I'm being held
against my will!

917
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:38,800
What's wrong with him?

918
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:43,519
John has
schizophrenia.

919
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:47,199
People with this disorder
are often paranoid.

920
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:52,440
But-
But his work.

921
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:54,679
He deals
with conspiracies...

922
01:06:55,639 --> 01:06:57,800
Yes, yes, I know.

923
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:01,880
In John's world,
these behaviors
are... accepted,

924
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,519
encouraged.

925
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:06,880
As such, his illness
may have gone untreated...

926
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,639
far longer
than is typical.

927
01:07:09,719 --> 01:07:11,159
What do you mean?
How long?

928
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:13,280
Possibly since
graduate school?

929
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:16,480
At least that's when
his hallucinations
seem to have begun.

930
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:18,760
What are you
talking about?
What hallucinations?

931
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,960
One, so far,
that I am aware of.

932
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,320
An imaginary roommate
named Charles Herman.

933
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,679
Charles
isn't imaginary.

934
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:30,239
He and John
have been best friends
since Princeton.

935
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,159
Have you ever met Charles?
Has he ever come to dinner?

936
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,000
He's always in town
for so little time,
lecturing.

937
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:38,719
Was he at your wedding?
He had to teach.

938
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:40,360
Have you ever
seen a picture of him,

939
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,880
talked to him
on the telephone?
This is ridiculous.

940
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,079
I phoned Princeton.

941
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:46,880
According to their
housing records,

942
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,760
John lived alone.

943
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:54,880
Now, which is more likely-
that your husband,

944
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:57,119
a mathematician
with no military training,

945
01:07:57,159 --> 01:07:59,519
is a government spy
fleeing the Russians-

946
01:07:59,559 --> 01:08:01,159
You're making him
sound crazy.

947
01:08:01,239 --> 01:08:04,320
...or, that he has
lost his grip on reality?

948
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:08,320
Now the only way
I can help him...

949
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,639
is to show him
the difference...

950
01:08:09,719 --> 01:08:12,360
between what's real...

951
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:14,519
and what is in his mind.

952
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:18,880
Come on.

953
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:22,720
What's he been
working on?

954
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,600
His work
is classified.

955
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,840
He mentioned
a supervisor...

956
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,279
by the name
of William Parcher.

957
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:33,239
Maybe Mr. Parcher
can clarify things
for us.

958
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:35,680
But I can't get to him
without clearances.

959
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,119
You want me to help you get...

960
01:08:38,199 --> 01:08:40,119
the details
of my husband's work?

961
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:43,520
John thinks
I'm a Russian spy.

962
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,479
Is that what
you think?

963
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,319
What did
the doctor say?
Is he sick?

964
01:08:52,359 --> 01:08:53,920
I don't know.

965
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,800
I want to see what John's
been working on.

966
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,720
You know you can't
go in his office.
It's classified, Alicia.

967
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,680
Stop. Oh!

968
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:15,279
Oh, my God.

969
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:21,079
Oh, my God.

970
01:09:27,720 --> 01:09:30,600
Why didn't you
say something?

971
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:33,560
Alicia,
John's always been...

972
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,880
a little weird.

973
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:38,079
He said he was
doing code-breaking,

974
01:09:38,119 --> 01:09:40,199
that it was eyes-only.

975
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:43,159
Top secret, part
of the military effort.
Was he?

976
01:09:43,239 --> 01:09:45,600
Well,
it was possible,
you know?

977
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:47,039
Directives come down
all the time...

978
01:09:47,079 --> 01:09:48,439
that some of us
aren't cleared for.

979
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:50,880
- It was possible.
- Possible, but...

980
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:52,640
not likely.

981
01:09:54,279 --> 01:09:56,960
Lately, he'd become
so much more agitated...

982
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,079
and then
when you called-

983
01:09:59,159 --> 01:10:01,640
So, is this all
he's been doing
every day?

984
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:03,960
Cutting out
magazines?

985
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:08,039
Well, not all.

986
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:29,239
I'm so sorry.
It's okay.

987
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:34,319
I missed you.
I missed you.

988
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:38,520
I have to talk
to you.

989
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,560
Okay.

990
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,520
Alicia, I've been
thinking about it,

991
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,039
and I do realize
that my behavior...

992
01:11:51,119 --> 01:11:54,079
and my inability to discuss
the situation with you...

993
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:56,479
must have appeared
insane.

994
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,680
I left you
with no other choice.

995
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,800
I do understand...

996
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,640
and I'm truly sorry.
That's okay.

997
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,119
Everything's
gonna be all right.

998
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,640
Everything's
gonna be all right.

999
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,520
We just have to talk quietly.

1000
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,039
They may be listening.
There may be microphones.

1001
01:12:19,079 --> 01:12:21,560
I'm gonna tell you
everything now.

1002
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:24,000
It's breaking
with protocol...

1003
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,920
but you need
to know,

1004
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,680
because you
have to help me
get out of here.

1005
01:12:31,319 --> 01:12:34,199
I've been doing
top secret work
for the government.

1006
01:12:34,279 --> 01:12:35,960
There's a threat
that exists...

1007
01:12:36,039 --> 01:12:38,560
of catastrophic
proportions.

1008
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,399
I think the Russians
feel my profile is too high.

1009
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:43,720
That's why they simply
just don't do away with me.

1010
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,039
They're keeping me here
to try to stop me...

1011
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:48,319
from doing my work.
You have to get to Wheeler.

1012
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:50,359
You have to find
William Parcher.
Stop.

1013
01:12:50,439 --> 01:12:53,239
He can help us.
Stop. Stop. Stop!

1014
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,520
I went to Wheeler.

1015
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:01,159
Good, good.

1016
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:03,199
There is no
William Parcher.

1017
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:05,439
Of course there is.

1018
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:07,479
I've been working for him.
Doing what?

1019
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:09,560
Breaking codes?

1020
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:11,640
Dropping packages
in a secret mailbox...

1021
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,560
for the government
to pick up?

1022
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:16,800
How could you
know that?

1023
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:18,920
Sol followed you.

1024
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,319
He thought it
was harmless.
Sol followed me?

1025
01:13:31,079 --> 01:13:33,560
They've never
been opened.

1026
01:13:36,119 --> 01:13:38,720
It isn't real.

1027
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,880
There is
no conspiracy, John.

1028
01:13:44,119 --> 01:13:46,840
There is
no William Parcher.

1029
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:50,199
It's in your mind.

1030
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,199
Do you
understand, baby?

1031
01:13:55,239 --> 01:13:57,800
You're sick.

1032
01:14:00,600 --> 01:14:02,840
You're sick, John.

1033
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,479
John!

1034
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,359
John!

1035
01:14:14,359 --> 01:14:15,960
Code red.

1036
01:14:16,039 --> 01:14:18,399
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

1037
01:14:18,439 --> 01:14:21,880
Dr. Rosen, code red.
Observation room two.

1038
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,640
John?

1039
01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:38,039
John?

1040
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:42,119
The implant's gone.

1041
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:45,039
I can't find it.

1042
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,640
It's gone.

1043
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,479
You see, the nightmare
of schizophrenia...

1044
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,800
is not knowing
what's true.

1045
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,279
Imagine...

1046
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:31,359
if you had suddenly learned
that the people and the places...

1047
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:34,279
and the moments
most important to you...

1048
01:15:34,359 --> 01:15:36,760
were not gone, not dead,

1049
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,199
but worse-

1050
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:41,119
had never been.

1051
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,399
What kind of hell
would that be?

1052
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:53,239
Administering
insulin.

1053
01:15:54,279 --> 01:15:56,439
8.42AM.

1054
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,880
How often?

1055
01:16:55,399 --> 01:16:58,199
Five times a week
for 1 0 weeks.

1056
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:23,840
John always spoke so fondly
of being here at Princeton.

1057
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,560
And Hansen is running
the department now.

1058
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,199
So he keeps reminding us,
and reminding us.

1059
01:17:30,159 --> 01:17:31,520
Yeah.

1060
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,720
John won't come near
the campus, though.

1061
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:36,600
I think he's ashamed.

1062
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,520
Hey. Hey.

1063
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:41,600
Want this?

1064
01:17:41,680 --> 01:17:45,159
So, Alicia, how-
how are you holding up?

1065
01:17:45,239 --> 01:17:47,880
Well, the delusions
have passed.

1066
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,119
They're saying
with the medication...

1067
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:51,720
and low stress
environment-

1068
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,479
No, l- I mean,
how are you?

1069
01:18:01,479 --> 01:18:03,640
I think often
what I feel...

1070
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,800
is obligation.

1071
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:11,960
Or guilt
over wanting to leave.

1072
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:17,239
Rage against John,
against God and-

1073
01:18:19,239 --> 01:18:20,479
But...

1074
01:18:23,399 --> 01:18:25,520
then I look at him...

1075
01:18:27,039 --> 01:18:31,159
and I force myself to see
the man that I married.

1076
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:33,920
And he becomes that man.

1077
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:38,199
He's transformed
into someone that I love.

1078
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:43,479
And I'm transformed
into someone who loves him.

1079
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:48,159
It's not all the time,

1080
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:50,920
but...

1081
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:52,640
it's enough.

1082
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,560
I think John is
a very lucky man...

1083
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,239
Alicia.

1084
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:04,279
So unlucky.

1085
01:19:07,159 --> 01:19:09,159
This is us. This is it?

1086
01:19:09,239 --> 01:19:11,840
It's nice.
It's near where I work.

1087
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,279
John? You've a visitor.

1088
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,720
Hi.

1089
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,279
Hi.

1090
01:19:20,359 --> 01:19:22,159
I hope it's okay.

1091
01:19:29,319 --> 01:19:30,840
Hey ya, chief.

1092
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,680
- Cigarette?
- Ah, no, thanks.

1093
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,760
I quit, actually.

1094
01:19:40,279 --> 01:19:42,520
Hello.
Hey, John.

1095
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,239
Have you met
Harvey?

1096
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:47,680
Umm, l...

1097
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,840
-John, there's no-
- Relax, it's okay.

1098
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:53,439
There's no point
in being nuts if you can't
have a little fun.

1099
01:19:53,479 --> 01:19:55,399
Jesus Christ, John.

1100
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:57,039
I should have known.

1101
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:00,239
Here you go.

1102
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:03,560
I can take those later.

1103
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:05,119
You're supposed
to take them now.

1104
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:09,640
- Can I bring you something?
- I'm okay.

1105
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:11,159
Okay.

1106
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,479
So, um... yeah.
I- I was in town...

1107
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:18,600
giving a workshop.

1108
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:20,600
I go back tonight.

1109
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,840
You know, Bender,
he really wanted...

1110
01:20:22,920 --> 01:20:27,239
to stop by
and you know, see you.
You know, say hi.

1111
01:20:27,319 --> 01:20:28,920
Squeamish?

1112
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,319
Yeah.

1113
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,760
I suppose
I would be, too.

1114
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:35,720
But alas,
I'm stuck with me.

1115
01:20:39,039 --> 01:20:42,119
I'm trying to solve
the Reimann hypothesis.
Uh-huh.

1116
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,439
Oh, yeah?

1117
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,520
I figured if-
if I dazzle them,

1118
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:50,680
they will have
to reinstate me.

1119
01:20:52,159 --> 01:20:55,560
But it's difficult
with the medication,

1120
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:58,920
because it's hard to...

1121
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:02,399
see the solution.

1122
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:13,279
You know, John,
you should go easy.

1123
01:21:13,319 --> 01:21:16,199
There are other
things besides-

1124
01:21:16,279 --> 01:21:17,520
besides work.

1125
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:21,880
What are they?

1126
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:41,000
Shh-hh.

1127
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,840
Shh.

1128
01:21:56,399 --> 01:21:58,319
What are you
thinking about?

1129
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:03,199
What do people do?

1130
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:05,600
It's life, John.

1131
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,560
Activities available,

1132
01:22:07,640 --> 01:22:10,119
just add meaning.

1133
01:22:17,239 --> 01:22:19,319
You could try
leaving the house.

1134
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:22,680
You know, maybe...

1135
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,760
talk to people.

1136
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,439
You could try
taking out the garbage.

1137
01:22:52,680 --> 01:22:55,199
And there's some more-
there's some more in...

1138
01:23:07,079 --> 01:23:09,439
Who- Who were
you talking to?

1139
01:23:09,479 --> 01:23:11,479
Garbage man.

1140
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:22,840
Garbage men don't come
at night.

1141
01:23:25,479 --> 01:23:27,439
I guess around here
they do.

1142
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,680
Sorry.

1143
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,560
Is it the medication?

1144
01:25:39,359 --> 01:25:41,720
I don't know
what to do.

1145
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:01,560
My mother's
going to keep the baby
a little longer tonight.

1146
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:04,800
I can get three hours
of overtime.

1147
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:31,680
I'm going to bed.

1148
01:26:38,079 --> 01:26:40,920
- Good night.
- Good night.

1149
01:27:55,800 --> 01:27:58,239
It's good to see you, John.

1150
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:01,279
It's been a while.

1151
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,239
Parcher?

1152
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:05,319
Yes, sir.

1153
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:10,119
You're not real!

1154
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:12,840
Of course I am.
Don't be ridiculous.

1155
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:19,600
I don't think that I would
go that way, John.

1156
01:28:21,039 --> 01:28:23,319
It's time for you
to get back to work.

1157
01:28:23,359 --> 01:28:26,239
The bomb is in
its final position...

1158
01:28:26,319 --> 01:28:27,760
here in the U.S.

1159
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:30,840
Knowing
your situation...

1160
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:33,439
requires you keep
a low profile,
"Mohammed,"

1161
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,520
we've brought
the mountain to you.

1162
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:57,439
We've narrowed the bomb's
location to somewhere...

1163
01:28:57,479 --> 01:28:59,199
on the eastern seaboard.

1164
01:28:59,279 --> 01:29:03,720
But we haven't been able
to pinpoint its exact position.

1165
01:29:05,960 --> 01:29:08,479
Their codes have grown
increasingly complex.

1166
01:29:11,079 --> 01:29:13,199
Here, look at this, John.

1167
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:17,279
What?

1168
01:29:17,319 --> 01:29:18,640
What?

1169
01:29:21,159 --> 01:29:24,600
- Dr. Rosen said-
- Rosen! That quack!

1170
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,560
"Schizophrenic break
from reality," right?

1171
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:28,479
Psychological bullshit!

1172
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,439
Look at me, John.

1173
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,800
John, look at me.

1174
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,439
Do I look
like I'm imagined?

1175
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,680
Wheeler has
no record of you.

1176
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:43,119
Do you think we list
our personnel?

1177
01:29:45,159 --> 01:29:48,199
John, I'm sorry you had
to go through all this.

1178
01:29:48,279 --> 01:29:51,560
I've gone to a great deal
of trouble to get you back.

1179
01:29:51,640 --> 01:29:54,239
I can restore
your status at Wheeler.

1180
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:56,920
I can let the world
know what you did.

1181
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,439
But I need you now, soldier.

1182
01:30:05,159 --> 01:30:07,479
I was so scared
you weren't real.

1183
01:30:15,479 --> 01:30:17,319
There's a storm
coming.

1184
01:30:17,399 --> 01:30:19,560
I'm just going to grab
the laundry, okay?

1185
01:30:19,640 --> 01:30:21,560
I'll draw his bath.

1186
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:26,399
It's okay.

1187
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:29,479
Okay.

1188
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,800
John?

1189
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:14,079
I've almost got it!
Charles, you just
watch the baby.

1190
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:15,279
I've got one more to close!

1191
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:17,199
- No!
- I'll be right there.

1192
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:19,800
- Oh, God.

1193
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:24,399
I need a towel.

1194
01:32:24,479 --> 01:32:27,479
Shhh.

1195
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,119
Charles was watching him.
He was okay.

1196
01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:30,920
There is no one here.

1197
01:32:32,279 --> 01:32:34,119
- Charles was watching him.
- There is no one here!

1198
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:36,000
He's been injected
with a cloaking serum.

1199
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:37,760
I can see him
because of a chemical...

1200
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,880
that was released
into my bloodstream...

1201
01:32:39,960 --> 01:32:42,319
when my implant dissolved.

1202
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:45,760
I couldn't tell you,
it was for your own protection!

1203
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:48,000
Alicia!

1204
01:32:53,439 --> 01:32:56,800
- No!
- Hello, I need
Dr. Rosen's office, please.

1205
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,520
You've got
to stop her, John.

1206
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:01,960
You leave her out of this.

1207
01:33:03,640 --> 01:33:06,239
- Who are you talking to?
- It's not her fault.

1208
01:33:06,279 --> 01:33:08,479
-John.
- She'll compromise us again.

1209
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,840
- No, she won't.
- You'll go back to the hospital.

1210
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,920
-John, answer me!
- Countless people will die.

1211
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:14,560
Alicia, please,
put the phone down.

1212
01:33:14,640 --> 01:33:17,119
- I can't let that happen.
- Yes, hello?

1213
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,359
Hi, I need Dr. Rosen.
Is he in?

1214
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:21,800
I'm sorry, John.

1215
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,359
No-oo!

1216
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,479
Alicia?

1217
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,399
You know
what you have to do, Nash.

1218
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:31,840
- Get away from me.
- She's too great a risk.

1219
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,079
Get away!

1220
01:33:34,119 --> 01:33:36,079
I didn't mean
to hurt you!

1221
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:41,039
Finish her.
She knows too much now.

1222
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:45,279
Uncle John?

1223
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:47,279
Take care of her,
you pathetic piece of shit,

1224
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:48,640
or I'll take care of you.

1225
01:33:48,680 --> 01:33:50,079
John,

1226
01:33:50,159 --> 01:33:52,680
Christ, John,
please do what he says.

1227
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:55,399
Move, soldier.

1228
01:33:55,479 --> 01:33:56,880
Now.

1229
01:33:56,960 --> 01:33:58,119
Uncle John?

1230
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:00,720
John, please!

1231
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:03,720
Now!

1232
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:05,600
Alicia and Charles never
coexist in the same...

1233
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,439
interactive field.
Alicia and Parcher...

1234
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:16,520
- Let's play!

1235
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:19,199
...Charles, and Marcee cannot
coexist with Alicia.

1236
01:34:19,239 --> 01:34:20,880
I understand.

1237
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:38,439
She never gets old.

1238
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:44,399
Marcee can't be real.
She never gets old.

1239
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,319
You see them now?

1240
01:35:26,199 --> 01:35:27,840
Yes.

1241
01:35:30,039 --> 01:35:32,239
Why did you
stop your meds?

1242
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:36,640
Because I couldn't
do my work.

1243
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,560
I couldn't help
with the baby.

1244
01:35:38,640 --> 01:35:40,319
I couldn't-

1245
01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:43,880
I couldn't respond
to my wife.

1246
01:35:46,119 --> 01:35:48,359
You think that's better
than being crazy?

1247
01:35:48,439 --> 01:35:51,399
We'll need to start you
on a higher run...

1248
01:35:51,479 --> 01:35:53,359
of insulin shocks
and a new medication.

1249
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:55,000
No.

1250
01:35:55,079 --> 01:35:56,840
There has
to be another way.

1251
01:35:56,920 --> 01:36:01,119
Schizophrenia is degenerative.
Some days maybe symptom-free,

1252
01:36:01,159 --> 01:36:02,760
but over time,
you are getting worse.

1253
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:05,760
It's a problem.
That's all it is.

1254
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,520
It's a problem
with no solution.

1255
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,279
And that's what I do,
I solve problems.

1256
01:36:10,359 --> 01:36:11,920
That's what I do best.
This isn't math.

1257
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,680
You can't come up
with a formula...

1258
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,640
to change the way
you experience the world.

1259
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:18,399
- All I have to do is apply my mind.
- There's no theorem, no proof.

1260
01:36:18,439 --> 01:36:21,039
- You can't reason
your way out of this.
- Why not? Why can't l?

1261
01:36:21,119 --> 01:36:23,800
Because your mind
is where the problem is
in the first place.

1262
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:27,840
I can do this.

1263
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,399
I can work it out.
All I need is time.

1264
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:36,680
Is that the baby?

1265
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:40,760
The baby's at my mother's, John.

1266
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:56,680
Without treatment, John,

1267
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,600
the fantasies
may take over...

1268
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:01,039
entirely.

1269
01:37:18,119 --> 01:37:20,319
You almost ready?

1270
01:37:22,199 --> 01:37:24,479
Rosen's waiting outside.

1271
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:27,119
I can't go back
to that hospital.

1272
01:37:30,960 --> 01:37:32,920
I won't come home.

1273
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:38,439
He said that
if you said that,

1274
01:37:39,159 --> 01:37:42,760
he has commitment
papers for me to sign.

1275
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:46,720
Well, maybe you
won't sign them.

1276
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:50,439
Maybe you'll just
give me some time.

1277
01:37:53,239 --> 01:37:55,159
I will try
to figure this out.

1278
01:37:57,439 --> 01:37:59,199
Whatever you do,

1279
01:37:59,279 --> 01:38:02,439
Rosen is right
about one thing.

1280
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:04,920
You shouldn't be here.

1281
01:38:07,239 --> 01:38:09,079
I'm not safe anymore.

1282
01:38:14,520 --> 01:38:16,439
Would you have
hurt me, John?

1283
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:27,039
I don't know.

1284
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:31,600
Maybe you should let
Dr. Rosen drive you
to your mother's.

1285
01:39:34,840 --> 01:39:38,199
Rosen said to call if you try
and kill me or anything.

1286
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:56,079
You want to know
what's real?

1287
01:40:01,319 --> 01:40:03,199
This.

1288
01:40:10,199 --> 01:40:12,079
This.

1289
01:40:17,159 --> 01:40:19,000
This.

1290
01:40:20,359 --> 01:40:22,439
This is real.

1291
01:40:25,640 --> 01:40:27,920
Maybe the part...

1292
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,279
that knows the waking
from the dream,

1293
01:40:31,640 --> 01:40:33,479
maybe it isn't here.

1294
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:39,560
Maybe it's here.

1295
01:40:44,039 --> 01:40:46,279
I need to believe...

1296
01:40:46,359 --> 01:40:49,640
that something
extraordinary is possible.

1297
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,520
Come.

1298
01:41:59,640 --> 01:42:01,439
Hello, Martin.

1299
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:08,000
Jesus Christ.

1300
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:11,159
No. I-

1301
01:42:11,239 --> 01:42:14,159
I don't have that one.
My savior complex...

1302
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:15,600
takes on a completely
different form.

1303
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:20,359
I heard what happened
and well,

1304
01:42:20,439 --> 01:42:22,760
I- I wanted to write
and I tried you at MacArthur's...

1305
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:24,840
but you'd left, and I just...

1306
01:42:36,439 --> 01:42:38,399
This is Helinger's old office.

1307
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:40,000
Yeah.

1308
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:42,479
Yeah, I stole it from him.

1309
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:47,119
Seems that you won
after all, Martin.

1310
01:42:48,439 --> 01:42:51,279
They were wrong, John.
No one wins.

1311
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:53,960
Please, please have a seat.

1312
01:42:54,039 --> 01:42:56,840
God, it's so good
to see you.

1313
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,159
What brings you
back to Princeton?

1314
01:43:01,239 --> 01:43:02,560
John?

1315
01:43:02,600 --> 01:43:05,680
John, I'm sorry,
but you have to tell him.

1316
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,760
Tell him you're a genius.
You're a genius, John!

1317
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:09,359
Tell him your work is critical.

1318
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:11,600
John, please!

1319
01:43:24,640 --> 01:43:28,039
Is there any chance
that you could ignore
what I just did?

1320
01:43:29,640 --> 01:43:32,399
Of course,
what are old friends for?

1321
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:35,960
Is that what we are, Martin?
Friends?

1322
01:43:36,039 --> 01:43:38,039
John, of course.

1323
01:43:38,119 --> 01:43:40,760
Of course.
We always have been.

1324
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,600
Alicia and I think that-

1325
01:43:47,680 --> 01:43:49,439
that fitting in,

1326
01:43:49,479 --> 01:43:51,399
being part of a community,

1327
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,279
might do me some good.

1328
01:43:55,359 --> 01:43:57,159
That a certain level
of attachment,

1329
01:43:57,239 --> 01:43:59,159
familiar places,
familiar people,

1330
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,279
might help me...

1331
01:44:02,359 --> 01:44:04,760
elbow out these-

1332
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:10,800
these certain delusions
that I have.

1333
01:44:15,319 --> 01:44:17,840
It's a lot to ask,
and now that I'm here,

1334
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:22,199
I'm quite certain
that you will just say no.

1335
01:44:25,399 --> 01:44:28,079
But I was wondering
if I could hang around.

1336
01:44:36,439 --> 01:44:37,840
Huh.

1337
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:43,800
Will you be needing an office?

1338
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:49,720
No.

1339
01:44:52,439 --> 01:44:55,199
No, I could just work
out of the library.

1340
01:44:55,279 --> 01:44:57,720
Well, this guy tries
to wander into the library,

1341
01:44:57,800 --> 01:45:00,840
but he doesn't have I.D.
Why can't people read
their memos, huh?

1342
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,560
Then he goes
totally nuts.

1343
01:45:02,640 --> 01:45:04,800
Not real! You're not real.

1344
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:06,640
There's no mission.

1345
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,920
Oh, shit. Shit.

1346
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,560
Not real!
You are not real!

1347
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:14,439
Is this what you are, soldier?

1348
01:45:14,520 --> 01:45:15,720
Some useless ghoul?

1349
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,720
The local madman?

1350
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:20,319
I'm not a soldier.
You're gonna end up
in a cell!

1351
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:22,560
Old, worthless,
discarded.

1352
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:23,800
There's no mission.

1353
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:25,439
And while you rock
and drool,

1354
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:27,000
the world will
burn to ashes!

1355
01:45:27,079 --> 01:45:29,439
You are not real!
You are not real!

1356
01:45:29,479 --> 01:45:31,079
You're still talking
to me, soldier.

1357
01:45:31,159 --> 01:45:34,319
There's no mission!
I'm not a soldier!

1358
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:35,960
John? John?

1359
01:45:36,039 --> 01:45:37,800
John, John, John, John.

1360
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:39,199
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

1361
01:45:39,239 --> 01:45:40,720
John, John!
It's okay.

1362
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:42,840
I just heard what happened,
I'm sorry. John-

1363
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:45,000
I'm not a soldier.
John. Hey, Nash.

1364
01:45:45,079 --> 01:45:48,359
Nash, hey.
Hey, you're all right.

1365
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:51,880
Nash, Nash,
hey, hey, hey.

1366
01:45:55,479 --> 01:45:58,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Nash!

1367
01:45:58,319 --> 01:45:59,439
John?

1368
01:46:01,479 --> 01:46:04,000
You should've seen their faces.

1369
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:06,720
Everybody was
just staring at me.

1370
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:08,319
John...

1371
01:46:08,399 --> 01:46:11,439
you know that stress
triggers the delusions.

1372
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,640
I know.

1373
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,800
But then,
on the way home,

1374
01:46:17,880 --> 01:46:20,600
Charles was there.

1375
01:46:24,279 --> 01:46:27,479
Sometimes, I really miss
talking to him.

1376
01:46:30,279 --> 01:46:32,560
Maybe Rosen's right.

1377
01:46:32,640 --> 01:46:36,000
Maybe I have to think
about going back into
the hospital again.

1378
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:37,960
No.

1379
01:46:38,039 --> 01:46:40,199
Come here.

1380
01:46:43,399 --> 01:46:46,119
Maybe try again tomorrow.

1381
01:47:09,199 --> 01:47:12,479
John, now, you can't
ignore me forever.

1382
01:47:17,560 --> 01:47:19,680
Charles, you've been
a very good friend to me.

1383
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,359
The best.

1384
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,640
But I won't talk to you again.

1385
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:30,960
I just can't.

1386
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:38,399
Same goes for you, baby girl.

1387
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:47,479
Good-bye.

1388
01:47:54,359 --> 01:47:56,119
Good-bye.

1389
01:48:09,479 --> 01:48:11,880
I was wondering if I might
audit your course.

1390
01:48:13,239 --> 01:48:16,119
It's- It's an honor,
Professor Nash.

1391
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,199
Is something wrong?

1392
01:48:22,439 --> 01:48:24,640
This will be
my first class.

1393
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:30,399
Good morning,

1394
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:32,600
eager young minds.

1395
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:53,800
It's never
gonna work, John.

1396
01:48:53,880 --> 01:48:56,279
You're just
humiliating yourself.

1397
01:48:58,760 --> 01:49:00,800
It's pathetic!

1398
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:02,840
You are being
pathetic.

1399
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:04,840
I'm ashamed of you.

1400
01:49:30,960 --> 01:49:32,920
Oh, man!

1401
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:39,399
Are you coming?
You're gonna be late.

1402
01:49:42,079 --> 01:49:43,840
Dad, you've got my books.
What?

1403
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,479
You've got my books.

1404
01:49:45,560 --> 01:49:47,880
Oh, right.

1405
01:49:47,960 --> 01:49:49,319
Thanks.

1406
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:51,960
Good-bye.
Bye.

1407
01:49:52,039 --> 01:49:53,760
See you tonight.

1408
01:49:53,840 --> 01:49:55,720
Bye, honey.

1409
01:51:24,439 --> 01:51:25,960
Did you just solve Reimann?

1410
01:51:26,039 --> 01:51:28,119
Well, what
do you think?

1411
01:51:28,199 --> 01:51:31,119
Huh.
That's an analog
to Frobenius...

1412
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:33,079
for noncommutative
extensions.

1413
01:51:34,239 --> 01:51:36,399
Yes, it is.

1414
01:51:36,479 --> 01:51:39,319
But it only appears
to work sporadically, so, no.

1415
01:51:39,399 --> 01:51:41,439
But...

1416
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:43,720
I believe I'm
making progress.

1417
01:51:44,720 --> 01:51:46,600
You're-

1418
01:51:46,680 --> 01:51:49,399
You're John Nash, right?

1419
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:53,760
Toby Kelly.
Hello.

1420
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:55,560
I've been studying
your equilibrium.

1421
01:51:55,640 --> 01:51:57,560
The one you wrote
here, at Princeton.

1422
01:51:57,640 --> 01:52:00,039
To come up with something
totally original, the way you did.

1423
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:01,479
You know, I was young.

1424
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:03,039
Umm...

1425
01:52:03,119 --> 01:52:05,399
I've been developing
a theory.

1426
01:52:19,119 --> 01:52:21,199
I believe I can prove...

1427
01:52:21,279 --> 01:52:23,920
that Galois extensions
are covering spaces.

1428
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,279
That everything,
everything is connected.

1429
01:52:26,359 --> 01:52:28,920
That it's all part
of the same subject.

1430
01:52:30,079 --> 01:52:31,880
When was the last time
you ate?

1431
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:34,399
Excuse me?
You know, food.

1432
01:52:34,479 --> 01:52:36,359
Oh, uh-

1433
01:52:36,439 --> 01:52:38,319
My wife,

1434
01:52:38,399 --> 01:52:40,159
she loves mayonnaise.

1435
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:43,359
Oh, thank you.

1436
01:52:43,399 --> 01:52:44,560
Thank you.

1437
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:47,359
Go on.

1438
01:52:47,399 --> 01:52:49,399
The function...

1439
01:52:49,479 --> 01:52:51,359
is in the two categories.
Um-hmm.

1440
01:52:55,359 --> 01:52:56,920
Alicia!

1441
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,560
Alicia!

1442
01:52:59,640 --> 01:53:02,720
...coming together
at maximum speed of...

1443
01:53:02,760 --> 01:53:04,760
Let us say
10milesperhour.

1444
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:08,000
So you have a fly
on the tire of bicycle B,

1445
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:10,920
and the fly, who can travel
at20milesan hour,

1446
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,560
leaves the tire
of bicycle B and it flies...

1447
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:14,680
to the tire of bicycle A
and backwards and forwards...

1448
01:53:14,760 --> 01:53:17,000
and so on and so forth
until the two bikes collide...

1449
01:53:17,079 --> 01:53:18,760
and the poor little fly
is squashed.

1450
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:20,880
- This is the important thing...

1451
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:22,920
about actually focusing in
and comprehending...

1452
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,920
the area that you're
dealing with.

1453
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:27,720
Mathematics is very specific,
and it is an art form,

1454
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:30,000
no matter what these
people around here
will tell you,

1455
01:53:30,079 --> 01:53:31,439
especially the people
from biology.

1456
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:33,000
Don't listen to any
of those people.

1457
01:53:33,079 --> 01:53:35,279
Let me go back
to what you were doing before.

1458
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:38,520
I might want to steal this,
write a book and get famous.

1459
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,800
I was thinking
that I might teach.

1460
01:53:43,159 --> 01:53:45,159
A classroom
with 50 students...

1461
01:53:45,239 --> 01:53:48,079
can be daunting
for anyone.

1462
01:53:48,159 --> 01:53:50,880
John, besides,
you're a terrible
teacher.

1463
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,720
I'm an acquired
taste, Martin.

1464
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:57,600
I was hoping there still
might be something
I could contribute.

1465
01:53:57,680 --> 01:53:59,560
What about the-

1466
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,640
Well, you know.

1467
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:03,960
Are they gone?

1468
01:54:09,720 --> 01:54:12,520
No, they're not gone.

1469
01:54:12,600 --> 01:54:14,119
And maybe they
never will be.

1470
01:54:14,199 --> 01:54:15,880
But I've gotten used
to ignoring them...

1471
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:19,199
and I think as a result
they've kind of given up on me.

1472
01:54:19,279 --> 01:54:21,119
You think that's
what it's like...

1473
01:54:21,199 --> 01:54:24,720
with all our dreams
and our nightmares, Martin?

1474
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:27,720
You've got to keep
feeding them for them
to stay alive?

1475
01:54:27,800 --> 01:54:31,119
John, they-
haunt you, though.

1476
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:35,720
They're my past, Martin.
Everybody's haunted by their past.

1477
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,479
Well, good-bye.

1478
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,880
John, I'll talk
to the department.

1479
01:54:44,760 --> 01:54:46,520
Maybe
in the spring.

1480
01:54:51,880 --> 01:54:53,640
Hey, Nash?

1481
01:54:55,239 --> 01:54:59,119
You- You scared?

1482
01:55:01,479 --> 01:55:03,359
Terrified.

1483
01:55:03,399 --> 01:55:05,680
Mortified.
Petrified.

1484
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:08,359
Stupefied by you.

1485
01:55:08,439 --> 01:55:09,760
Now you ought best
ring Alicia,

1486
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:11,800
or you're gonna get me...
I'll ring her.

1487
01:55:11,880 --> 01:55:13,159
in an awful
lot of trouble.

1488
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,600
Thanks, Professor.
Good-bye.

1489
01:55:18,680 --> 01:55:20,520
Have a nice day.
Good-bye.

1490
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:23,359
Papers in hand, Mr. Beyer.

1491
01:55:23,399 --> 01:55:25,319
Professor Nash?

1492
01:55:28,439 --> 01:55:30,920
Can you see him?
Yeah.

1493
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:32,520
You sure?
Uh-huh.

1494
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,680
Positive?
He's within your vision?

1495
01:55:34,760 --> 01:55:36,279
- Okay. Good.

1496
01:55:36,359 --> 01:55:39,239
Forgive me, I'm just
always suspicious of new people.

1497
01:55:39,319 --> 01:55:41,560
See you next week,
Professor.
See you next week.

1498
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:44,359
So now that I know
that you're real,

1499
01:55:44,439 --> 01:55:46,800
who are you,
and what can I
do for you?

1500
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:50,119
Professor, my name
is Thomas King...

1501
01:55:50,199 --> 01:55:51,279
Thomas King?
Mm-hm.

1502
01:55:51,359 --> 01:55:52,760
and I'm here
to tell you...

1503
01:55:52,840 --> 01:55:55,760
that you're
being considered
for the Nobel Prize.

1504
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:05,600
Forgive me, but I'm just
a little stunned.

1505
01:56:05,680 --> 01:56:08,039
Over the past few years
your equilibrium...

1506
01:56:08,119 --> 01:56:10,600
has become a cornerstone
of modern economics.

1507
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:12,840
Suddenly everybody
likes that one.

1508
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:17,039
What about my work
on other some such projects-
manifold embedding?

1509
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:20,199
The application
of your bargaining problem...

1510
01:56:20,279 --> 01:56:24,399
to FCC bandwidth auctions
or to antitrust cases-

1511
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:26,119
Antitrust cases?
Yes.

1512
01:56:26,199 --> 01:56:28,399
I never would have
considered that.

1513
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:30,000
Well...
Have I just reached...

1514
01:56:30,079 --> 01:56:32,680
some level of honesty
that borders on stupidity?

1515
01:56:32,760 --> 01:56:34,560
No, no, you haven't.

1516
01:56:34,640 --> 01:56:36,560
'Cause, I wouldn't
have thought of that.

1517
01:56:41,479 --> 01:56:43,479
Shall we have tea?

1518
01:56:45,359 --> 01:56:47,600
Oh, I don't go in there.
I usually just...

1519
01:56:47,680 --> 01:56:49,479
take my sandwich
in the library.

1520
01:56:49,560 --> 01:56:53,359
Come on, John.
Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.

1521
01:56:53,439 --> 01:56:55,399
M-Most-

1522
01:56:55,479 --> 01:56:57,279
Most commercially
available brands of tea...

1523
01:56:57,359 --> 01:56:58,920
are not suitable
to my palate.

1524
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:00,640
I'm not-

1525
01:57:00,720 --> 01:57:03,720
There are some
Northern Indian teas
which are dense enough-

1526
01:57:03,800 --> 01:57:06,279
I enjoy the flavor
that they have-

1527
01:57:06,359 --> 01:57:08,000
I have not been
in this room...

1528
01:57:08,079 --> 01:57:10,960
for some many years.
I wonder what tea they serve.

1529
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:14,119
Why, thank you,
young lady.

1530
01:57:16,399 --> 01:57:18,640
Things have certainly
changed around here.

1531
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,880
I have a son that age.

1532
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,800
Harvard.

1533
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:28,880
Hmm.

1534
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,399
I would have thought
the nominations...

1535
01:57:31,479 --> 01:57:33,840
for the Nobel Prize
would have been secret.

1536
01:57:33,920 --> 01:57:35,600
I would have thought
you'd only find out...

1537
01:57:35,680 --> 01:57:37,199
if you won or lost.

1538
01:57:37,279 --> 01:57:39,359
That is generally
the case, yes.

1539
01:57:39,439 --> 01:57:41,479
But these are
special circumstances.

1540
01:57:42,720 --> 01:57:44,960
The awards
are substantial.

1541
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,359
They require
private funding.
As such,

1542
01:57:49,439 --> 01:57:52,279
the image
of the Nobel is...

1543
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,439
I see. You came here
to find out if I was crazy?

1544
01:57:57,680 --> 01:57:59,840
Find out if I would...

1545
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:01,800
screw everything up
if I actually won?

1546
01:58:03,640 --> 01:58:06,279
Dance around the podium,
strip naked and squawk
like a chicken,

1547
01:58:06,359 --> 01:58:07,680
things of this nature?

1548
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:10,119
Something
like that, yes.

1549
01:58:11,079 --> 01:58:13,000
Would I
embarrass you?

1550
01:58:16,399 --> 01:58:18,439
Yes, it is possible.

1551
01:58:21,079 --> 01:58:23,079
You see, l-

1552
01:58:23,800 --> 01:58:26,000
I am crazy.

1553
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:30,000
I take the newer
medications,

1554
01:58:33,279 --> 01:58:36,119
but I still see things
that are not here.

1555
01:58:38,279 --> 01:58:40,399
I just choose
not to acknowledge them.

1556
01:58:42,439 --> 01:58:44,199
Like a diet of the mind,

1557
01:58:44,279 --> 01:58:46,600
I choose not to indulge
certain appetites.

1558
01:58:48,920 --> 01:58:51,680
Like my appetite
for patterns.

1559
01:58:53,239 --> 01:58:57,039
Perhaps my appetite
to imagine and to dream.

1560
01:58:58,039 --> 01:58:59,880
Professor Nash.

1561
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:07,119
It's good to have
you here, John.

1562
01:59:07,199 --> 01:59:09,039
Thank you.

1563
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:17,319
It's an honor, sir.
Thank you very much.

1564
01:59:17,399 --> 01:59:19,000
A privilege,
Professor.

1565
01:59:23,159 --> 01:59:24,560
Professor.

1566
01:59:29,720 --> 01:59:32,600
Nicely done, John.
Thank you, Tom.

1567
01:59:33,720 --> 01:59:35,399
Thank you.

1568
01:59:35,479 --> 01:59:38,039
Thank you.

1569
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,039
Thank you, Ed.

1570
01:59:55,319 --> 01:59:58,119
That was certainly
most unexpected.

1571
02:00:18,279 --> 02:00:20,439
Thank you.

1572
02:00:24,359 --> 02:00:26,600
I've always believed in numbers.

1573
02:00:26,680 --> 02:00:29,119
In the equations and logics...

1574
02:00:29,199 --> 02:00:31,039
that lead to reason.

1575
02:00:31,119 --> 02:00:33,920
But after a lifetime
of such pursuits,

1576
02:00:33,960 --> 02:00:36,359
I ask,

1577
02:00:36,439 --> 02:00:38,880
what truly is logic?

1578
02:00:38,960 --> 02:00:41,960
Who decides reason?

1579
02:00:43,359 --> 02:00:46,640
My quest has taken me
through the physical,

1580
02:00:46,720 --> 02:00:48,520
the metaphysical,

1581
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,800
the delusional...

1582
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,800
and back.

1583
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:59,520
And I have made
the most important
discovery of my career.

1584
02:01:01,399 --> 02:01:04,560
The most important discovery
of my life.

1585
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:10,359
It is only in the mysterious
equations of love...

1586
02:01:10,439 --> 02:01:13,319
that any logical
reasons can be found.

1587
02:01:16,600 --> 02:01:19,720
I'm only here tonight
because of you.

1588
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:23,800
You are
the reason I am.

1589
02:01:27,319 --> 02:01:30,039
You are all my reasons.

1590
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:35,720
Thank you.

1591
02:02:27,159 --> 02:02:29,520
So nice to have
met you.

1592
02:02:32,119 --> 02:02:33,840
I'll call
for the car, Dad.

1593
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:35,319
Bye bye.

1594
02:02:35,399 --> 02:02:37,000
Bye bye.

1595
02:02:37,079 --> 02:02:39,880
Are you ready to go now?
Oh, yes, I am.

1596
02:02:39,960 --> 02:02:42,399
Yes, indeed,
and yes, please.

1597
02:02:42,479 --> 02:02:45,159
Thank you so much.

1598
02:02:45,239 --> 02:02:46,520
Thank you.

1599
02:02:48,960 --> 02:02:51,079
What is it?
What's wrong?

1600
02:02:54,720 --> 02:02:56,479
Nothing.

1601
02:02:58,079 --> 02:02:59,359
Nothing at all.

1602
02:03:01,239 --> 02:03:03,760
Come with me,
young lady.
Oh-hh...

1603
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:06,199
I have a car outside.

1604
02:03:06,279 --> 02:03:08,680
Are you interested
in a ride?

1605
02:03:09,680 --> 02:03:11,319
Where's it going to?

1606
02:03:30,760 --> 02:03:34,279
l will

1607
02:03:34,359 --> 02:03:37,720
Watch you

1608
02:03:37,800 --> 02:03:44,319
in the darkness

1609
02:03:44,399 --> 02:03:48,079
Show you

1610
02:03:48,159 --> 02:03:51,479
Love will

1611
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:57,399
See you through

1612
02:03:59,119 --> 02:04:06,159
When the bad dreams

1613
02:04:06,239 --> 02:04:13,000
Wake you crying

1614
02:04:13,079 --> 02:04:18,880
I'll show you

1615
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:26,760
All love can do

1616
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:34,760
What love can do

1617
02:04:34,840 --> 02:04:38,600
l will watch
through the night

1618
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:42,600
Hold you in my arms

1619
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:44,279
Give you dreams

1620
02:04:44,359 --> 02:04:49,319
Where none will be

1621
02:04:49,399 --> 02:04:53,359
l will watch
through the dark

1622
02:04:53,439 --> 02:04:57,000
Till the morning comes

1623
02:04:57,079 --> 02:04:59,880
All the light

1624
02:04:59,960 --> 02:05:02,159
I'll take you
through the night

1625
02:05:02,239 --> 02:05:04,960
To see

1626
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:08,840
The light

1627
02:05:08,920 --> 02:05:12,039
Showing us all love

1628
02:05:12,119 --> 02:05:16,680
Can be

1629
02:05:17,960 --> 02:05:20,920
l will

1630
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,199
Guard you

1631
02:05:24,279 --> 02:05:31,840
With my bright wings

1632
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:38,920
Stay till your heart

1633
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:47,359
Learns to see

1634
02:05:47,439 --> 02:05:52,640
All love

1635
02:05:52,720 --> 02:05:57,000
Can... 

1636
02:05:57,079 --> 02:06:04,760
Be

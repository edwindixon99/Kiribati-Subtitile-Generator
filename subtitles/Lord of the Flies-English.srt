1
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:42,752
If three points are taken
in two sides of a triangle,

2
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:46,485
and the third side reduced,
or all three sides reduced...

3
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,619
so that the product of the three
alternate segments taken in order--

4
00:01:09,749 --> 00:01:12,775
# Kyrie, kyrie #

5
00:01:12,852 --> 00:01:15,082
# Eleison #

6
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:19,524
# Kyrie eleison #

7
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:24,029
# Kyrie eleison #

8
00:01:24,097 --> 00:01:29,194
# Kyrie eleison #

9
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:34,172
# Kyrie eleison #

10
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,510
# Eleison ##

11
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:52,224
##

12
00:02:02,702 --> 00:02:05,637
##

13
00:04:38,524 --> 00:04:40,754
Hi! Ouch!

14
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:43,295
Hey, wait for me.

15
00:04:43,363 --> 00:04:46,992
I can't hardly move
with all these creeper things.

16
00:04:48,868 --> 00:04:51,962
Them other kids must have
got scattered in the dark.

17
00:04:52,038 --> 00:04:55,371
We ought to go and find them.

18
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:19,961
My auntie told me not to run
on account of my asthma.

19
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:22,227
- Asthma?
- That's right.

20
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:25,828
I was the only boy
in our school that had asthma.

21
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:32,939
And I've been wearing specs
since I was three.

22
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,805
- Where's the plane?
- The storm must have dragged it out.

23
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:42,171
There must have been
some kids still in it.

24
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:46,183
Are there any grown-ups?

25
00:06:46,252 --> 00:06:49,119
- I don't think so.
- What's your name?

26
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:51,122
Ralph.

27
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,124
I don't care what they call me,

28
00:06:53,192 --> 00:06:56,355
as long as they don't call me
what they did at school.

29
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:58,363
What's that?

30
00:06:59,732 --> 00:07:03,327
- They used to call me "Piggy".
- Piggy!

31
00:07:03,402 --> 00:07:06,200
As long as you don't
tell the others.

32
00:07:09,809 --> 00:07:11,777
Daddy's a commander in the Navy.

33
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:17,148
One day when he gets leave,
he'll come and rescue us.

34
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:48,372
- Aren't you coming in?
- Ooh, it's hot.

35
00:07:48,447 --> 00:07:50,472
No. My auntie wouldn't let me--
account of my asthma.

36
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:51,983
Sucks to your asthma.

37
00:07:54,186 --> 00:07:57,121
You can't half swim well.

38
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,411
- Hey, look!
- It's a shell.

39
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,176
I've seen one like it before
on someone's back wall.

40
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:29,517
A conch, he called it. He used
to blow it, and his mum would come.

41
00:08:34,694 --> 00:08:37,322
He blew from down here.

42
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,990
You've done it!

43
00:08:48,841 --> 00:08:51,776
Hey! Is anyone there?

44
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:06,157
Hey! Hey!

45
00:09:11,464 --> 00:09:14,126
I think we ought explore a bit.

46
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,033
- What's your name?
- Percival Williams Madison...

47
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:22,769
the Vicarage, Hartcourt,
St. Anthony, telephone: Hartcourt 241.

48
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,610
- And what's your name?
- George.

49
00:09:29,148 --> 00:09:31,412
- What's your name?
- Sam and Eric.

50
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,418
Sam and Eric.

51
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:36,080
Sam and Eric.

52
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:40,251
# Kyrie, kyrie, kyrie eleison #

00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:45,923

65
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:40,877
Choir, halt!

66
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,656
Where's the man
with the trumpet?

67
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:47,022
There's no man
with a trumpet. Only me.

68
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:49,493
- Isn't there a man here?
- No.

69
00:10:49,562 --> 00:10:52,224
Then we'll have
to look after ourselves.

70
00:10:52,298 --> 00:10:56,792
We're having a meeting.
Come and join us.

71
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:59,360
Is he all right?

72
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:01,633
Put him in the shade, quick!

73
00:11:11,283 --> 00:11:15,447
- Let him alone.
- But, Merridew.

74
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:19,855
He'll be all right.
Simon's always throwing a faint.

75
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:22,826
Now let's decide
what we're going to do.

76
00:11:22,895 --> 00:11:27,229
That's why Ralph made a meeting--
so as we can decide what to do.

77
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:29,893
We got most names.

78
00:11:29,969 --> 00:11:32,767
Those two-- they're twins.
Sam and Eric.

79
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:35,272
- I'm Sam.
- I'm Eric.

80
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:36,968
I'm Ralph.

81
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:41,508
- And you?
- Douglas.

82
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,640
- Yours?
- Charles.

83
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,379
And what are all your names?

84
00:11:47,453 --> 00:11:49,387
Henry.

85
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:52,557
Maurice.

86
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:56,227
Robert.

87
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:00,698
Wilbur.

88
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:05,703
Harold.

89
00:12:08,107 --> 00:12:10,041
Bill.

90
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:14,112
Roger.

91
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,417
- Simon.
- I'm Jack.

92
00:12:21,287 --> 00:12:24,154
- And that boy there. He--
- You're talking too much.

93
00:12:24,223 --> 00:12:26,851
- Shut up, Fatty!
- His name's not Fatty.

94
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,360
- His real name's Piggy.
- Piggy!

95
00:12:47,112 --> 00:12:49,546
We've got to decide
about being rescued.

96
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:52,083
I think we ought to have
a chief to decide things.

97
00:12:52,151 --> 00:12:54,915
Someone must take charge.

98
00:12:54,987 --> 00:12:56,921
- I ought to be chief.
- Him with the shell!

99
00:12:56,989 --> 00:13:01,085
- He got us together.
- I'm chief chorister and head boy.

100
00:13:02,194 --> 00:13:03,593
Let's have a vote.

101
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,256
All right. We'll have a vote.

102
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,962
Who wants Jack for chief then?

103
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,611
- Who wants me?
- Me!

104
00:13:22,681 --> 00:13:24,945
- Me!
- Me!

105
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:26,951
Me. Me.

106
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:40,264
I'm chief, then.

107
00:13:45,137 --> 00:13:48,629
Jack's in charge of the choir.
What do you want them to be?

108
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:51,942
Hunters.

109
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,479
Choir, take off your togs.

110
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:03,444
Hey, what are you wearing
those funny clothes for?

111
00:14:03,522 --> 00:14:05,786
It's our uniform.

112
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:17,665
Listen, everybody.
If this isn't an island,

113
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:19,670
we might get rescued
straight away.

114
00:14:19,738 --> 00:14:21,672
So we've got to decide
if it is.

115
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:25,267
Three of us will go
on an expedition to find out.

116
00:14:25,344 --> 00:14:29,508
I'll go, and Jack.

117
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:32,311
- And--
- Take me. Please.

118
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:34,477
You. You all right now?

119
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:40,885
- I'll come.
- We don't want you. Three's enough.

120
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,326
I was with him
when he found the conch.

121
00:14:43,395 --> 00:14:46,660
I was with him
before anyone else was.

122
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:58,232
- You can't come.
- You told them after what I said...

123
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:01,711
after I said I didn't want--

124
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,714
What are you talking about?

125
00:15:03,782 --> 00:15:06,216
About being called Piggy.

126
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:10,779
I said I didn't care
as long as they didn't call me Piggy.

127
00:15:10,856 --> 00:15:13,586
And I said not to tell.

128
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,651
And then you went
and said straight out--

129
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:19,220
Better Piggy than Fatty.

130
00:15:19,298 --> 00:15:21,994
And anyway, I'm sorry
if you feel like that.

131
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:25,935
Go back, Piggy, and take names.
That's your job. So long.

132
00:16:21,693 --> 00:16:23,627
Hey, look!

133
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:31,158
One, two, three.

134
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:32,965
Heave!

135
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,075
Heave!

136
00:19:01,186 --> 00:19:04,553
We're on an uninhabited island.

137
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:08,286
We shall have
to look after ourselves.

138
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,126
But it's a good island.
There's lots of fruit, water,

139
00:19:12,197 --> 00:19:15,496
and I'm pretty sure there aren't
any dangerous animals.

140
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:18,468
So things aren't so bad.

141
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:20,471
None of us are hurt.

142
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,373
There isn't any danger,

143
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:27,037
and we can build shelters
and be comfortable.

144
00:19:29,314 --> 00:19:32,442
So if we're sensible--
if we do things properly--

145
00:19:32,517 --> 00:19:35,350
if we don't lose our head--
we'll be all right.

146
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:40,156
- But where will we sleep?
- We'll build shelters.

147
00:19:40,225 --> 00:19:43,194
We can have smashing fun.

148
00:19:43,262 --> 00:19:46,197
And another thing.
We can't have everybody talking at once.

149
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:51,225
We shall have to put our hands up,
then I'll give him the conch.

150
00:19:51,303 --> 00:19:54,136
I agree with Ralph.

151
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:56,140
We've got to have rules
and obey them.

152
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,802
After all, we're not savages.
We're English.

153
00:19:58,877 --> 00:20:01,243
And the English are best at everything.

154
00:20:01,313 --> 00:20:05,716
So we'll have lots of rules,
and when anybody breaks them--

155
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:13,013
- Piggy, Piggy, Piggy!
- Quiet!

156
00:20:13,091 --> 00:20:17,118
You're not letting Ralph
get to the most important thing.

157
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:21,359
Who knows we're here?

158
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:24,732
Nobody knows we're here.

159
00:20:24,803 --> 00:20:28,261
Perhaps they knew
where we were going to,

160
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,604
perhaps not.

161
00:20:30,676 --> 00:20:34,669
But they don't know where we are now
'cause we never got there.

162
00:20:34,746 --> 00:20:37,681
We might stay here
till we die.

163
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:04,101
He wants to know what you're going to do
about the snake thing.

164
00:21:04,176 --> 00:21:07,407
Tell us about
the snake thing.

165
00:21:10,449 --> 00:21:13,577
Now he says
it was a beastie.

166
00:21:13,652 --> 00:21:15,381
Beastie?

167
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:22,619
- A snake thing, ever so big. He saw it.
- When?

168
00:21:26,198 --> 00:21:31,261
When he was hiding
in the jungle in the dark.

169
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:34,897
He says when the rain stopped,

170
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:39,171
it turned into one of them things
like ropes in the trees...

171
00:21:39,244 --> 00:21:41,576
and hung in the branches.

172
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:44,843
He says,
"Will it come back tonight?"

173
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:53,456
But there isn't a beastie.

174
00:21:53,525 --> 00:21:56,016
I tell you,
there isn't a beast.

175
00:21:57,262 --> 00:21:59,321
Ralph's right, of course.

176
00:21:59,398 --> 00:22:03,095
There isn't a snake thing, but
if there was, we'd hunt and kill it.

177
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:07,563
There's another thing.
If a ship comes near,

178
00:22:07,639 --> 00:22:09,573
they may not notice us.

179
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:12,974
So we must make smoke on top
of the mountain. We must make a fire.

180
00:22:13,044 --> 00:22:14,671
Come on. Follow me.

181
00:22:14,746 --> 00:22:18,409
- Yes!
- Let's go now!

182
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:25,613
Just like kids--
like a crowd of kids.

183
00:22:30,595 --> 00:22:33,496
I bet it's gone teatime.

184
00:22:46,445 --> 00:22:48,379
Anybody got any matches?

185
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,286
My, what a big heap
you've made!

186
00:22:57,355 --> 00:22:59,516
Piggy's specs!
Come on!

187
00:23:09,601 --> 00:23:11,660
Get out of the light!

188
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:14,432
Roger, hey, Roger.
Come on over here.

189
00:23:30,956 --> 00:23:32,890
My specs!

190
00:23:37,929 --> 00:23:41,456
Ralph, I'll split up my choir--
my hunters, that is.

191
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,694
And we'll be responsible
for keeping the fire going.

192
00:23:46,938 --> 00:23:50,738
We'll make a big blaze now.
It'll last all night.

193
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,943
Come and give us a hand.

194
00:24:51,202 --> 00:24:53,136
Attention!

195
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:09,953
Here comes one.

196
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:14,250
This is a nice one.

197
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:28,971
Just a minute.
Be careful.

198
00:25:32,911 --> 00:25:34,401
Go!

199
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,072
No!

200
00:25:37,148 --> 00:25:39,082
It isn't gonna hit you!

201
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:41,382
Ooh!

202
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:44,320
Come on, come on!

203
00:27:32,931 --> 00:27:35,297
Kill! Kill!

204
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:41,132
No throwing sand!

205
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:53,215
Ralph, come here! It's a plane!

206
00:27:53,284 --> 00:27:54,842
A plane! A plane!

207
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:59,219
Can't you hear it? Ralph, it's going!
Hurry up! Ralph!

208
00:28:01,192 --> 00:28:05,458
I can't see no smoke.
Where is it?

209
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:10,163
Smoke.

210
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:13,398
Piggy's glasses!
If the fire's out, we'll need them!

211
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:37,584
Stop! Come back!
Come back!

212
00:28:37,662 --> 00:28:41,758
Come back! Come back!

213
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,283
They've let
the bloody fire out!

214
00:29:09,294 --> 00:29:13,492
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

215
00:29:13,565 --> 00:29:15,499
Hey, Ralph!

216
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:20,297
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

217
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:22,635
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

218
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:25,870
Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

219
00:29:25,944 --> 00:29:29,277
Bash her in! Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

220
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:31,941
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

221
00:29:32,016 --> 00:29:35,782
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!

222
00:29:35,854 --> 00:29:38,288
Slit her throat!
Bash her in! Kill the pig!

223
00:29:38,356 --> 00:29:42,349
Slit her throat! Bash her in!
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!

224
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:44,361
Bash her in!
Kill the pig!

225
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:46,920
Look. We killed a pig!
We stole up on it!

226
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:48,932
You let the fire out.

227
00:29:50,768 --> 00:29:53,293
We can light it up again.

228
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:02,846
You should have been
with us, Ralph.

229
00:30:02,914 --> 00:30:05,144
There was lots of blood!
You should have seen it.

230
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:09,243
There was a plane.
There was a plane!

231
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:14,384
They might have seen us.
We might have gone home!

232
00:30:26,104 --> 00:30:28,868
You and your blood, Jack Merridew!

233
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,899
You and your hunting!
We might have gone home!

234
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:34,911
We needed meat.

235
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:41,049
You didn't
ought to have let the fire go out!

236
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,088
My specs!

237
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,220
Here. Here they are.

238
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:14,684
Just you wait!

239
00:31:14,752 --> 00:31:18,051
That was a dirty trick.

240
00:31:18,122 --> 00:31:21,091
All right, all right.
I'm sorry!

241
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:23,855
About the fire, I mean.

242
00:31:23,928 --> 00:31:28,228
There. I apologize.

243
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:32,502
Light the fire, then.

244
00:31:33,037 --> 00:31:35,505
Choir!

245
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:42,811
Piggy.

246
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,643
No, Ralph, don't! Please!

247
00:31:44,716 --> 00:31:46,650
I'll bring them back.

248
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:03,733
Will it swell up his legs?

249
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:05,735
Give me a leg.

250
00:32:06,971 --> 00:32:09,872
- Give it to me.
- Give me a piece, please.

251
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:00,621
Aren't I havin' none?

252
00:33:00,691 --> 00:33:02,784
You didn't hunt.

253
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,819
No more did Ralph.
No more did Simon.

254
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:15,070
Eat, damn you!

255
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:33,517
- Kill the pig!
- Oink, oink, oink.

256
00:33:33,591 --> 00:33:36,958
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

257
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:39,758
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

258
00:33:39,831 --> 00:33:42,664
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

259
00:33:42,733 --> 00:33:45,531
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

260
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:48,163
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

261
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:50,173
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat!

262
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:52,175
Quiet!

263
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:56,111
Get down on the beach.
We're calling an assembly.

264
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:11,291
Things are beginning to break up.

265
00:34:12,797 --> 00:34:15,561
I don't know why.

266
00:34:15,633 --> 00:34:17,794
It all began well.

267
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:21,430
Then people started forgetting
what really matters.

268
00:34:24,742 --> 00:34:29,179
The most important thing for all
of us is getting rescued.

269
00:34:32,116 --> 00:34:35,574
So now let's discuss who does what,
and when we have decided,

270
00:34:38,122 --> 00:34:40,989
we can start again...

271
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:44,050
and be careful about things
like the fire.

272
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:48,665
All right, so the fire went out.

273
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:51,065
But we're hunters.
We got you meat.

274
00:34:51,135 --> 00:34:53,365
And if there is a beast,

275
00:34:53,437 --> 00:34:56,270
it's my hunters who
will protect you from it.

276
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:11,855
What's your name?

277
00:35:11,923 --> 00:35:15,950
What's your name? What's your name?

278
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:18,018
What's your name?

279
00:35:21,165 --> 00:35:23,099
Quiet! Quiet!

280
00:35:25,336 --> 00:35:28,271
What's your name?

281
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:32,070
Percival Williams Madison,
the Vicarage,

282
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:34,873
Hartcourt, St. Anthony.

283
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:38,609
Telephone--

284
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:42,084
Telephone--

285
00:35:42,153 --> 00:35:45,088
Tele--

286
00:36:30,901 --> 00:36:32,835
What did he say?

287
00:36:32,903 --> 00:36:36,066
He says there's a beast.

288
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,870
It comes out of the sea.

289
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:05,062
My daddy said they haven't found
all the animals in the sea.

290
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:07,934
My daddy says
there are animals--

291
00:37:08,005 --> 00:37:09,996
What do you call them?

292
00:37:10,074 --> 00:37:13,373
They make ink
and are hundreds of feet long...

293
00:37:13,444 --> 00:37:15,412
and eat whales whole.

294
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:18,812
A squid can't come out of the water.

295
00:37:34,398 --> 00:37:37,026
Maybe he means
it's some sort of ghost.

296
00:37:37,101 --> 00:37:40,537
Maybe that's
what the beast is, a ghost.

297
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:51,407
I don't believe
in no ghosts. Ever.

298
00:37:51,482 --> 00:37:54,918
Who cares what you believe, Fatty?

299
00:37:57,688 --> 00:38:01,954
Maybe there is a beast.

300
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:04,824
Hear him. He's got the conch.

301
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,657
What I mean is,

302
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:14,899
maybe it's only us.

303
00:38:14,972 --> 00:38:16,906
Nuts!

304
00:38:23,647 --> 00:38:27,413
We should have left all this
till daylight.

305
00:38:27,485 --> 00:38:29,419
We're tired.

306
00:38:31,355 --> 00:38:36,088
We'll have a vote--
on ghosts, I mean--

307
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,720
and then go back
to the shelters.

308
00:38:40,698 --> 00:38:43,132
Who thinks there
may be ghosts?

309
00:39:03,053 --> 00:39:06,750
- I see.
- I didn't vote for no ghosts.

310
00:39:06,824 --> 00:39:08,883
Remember that, all of you.

311
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,927
You shut up, you fat slug!

312
00:39:10,995 --> 00:39:12,963
I got the conch!

313
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,157
Oh, Jack, let him speak.
He's got the conch.

314
00:39:15,232 --> 00:39:17,996
And you shut up. Who are you,
telling people what to do?

315
00:39:18,068 --> 00:39:21,435
- You can't hunt. You can't sing.
- I'm chief. I was chosen.

316
00:39:21,505 --> 00:39:24,269
Why should choosing make any difference,
telling people what to do?

317
00:39:24,341 --> 00:39:28,038
- Piggy's got the conch.
- Favor Piggy as you always do.

318
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:30,205
- Jack!
- Jack! Jack!

319
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:33,045
- You're breaking the rules!
- Who cares?

320
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:35,449
Because the rules are
the only thing we've got.

321
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,783
Bullocks to the rules!
We're strong. We hunt.

322
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:40,050
If there's a beast,
we'll hunt it down!

323
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:53,163
What's grown-ups going
to say? Look at 'em!

324
00:39:54,638 --> 00:39:59,337
I think I ought to
give up being chief.

325
00:40:00,744 --> 00:40:05,147
You can't, Ralph. Not now.

326
00:40:05,216 --> 00:40:09,380
Blow the conch.
You've got to be tough.

327
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:12,354
Make them do what you want.

328
00:40:16,293 --> 00:40:18,261
If I blow the conch,

329
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:20,820
and they don't come back,

330
00:40:20,898 --> 00:40:23,025
then we've had it.

331
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,081
Are there ghosts, Piggy?
Or beasts?

332
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:42,516
Of course there aren't.

333
00:40:42,586 --> 00:40:46,044
- Why not?
- Because things wouldn't make sense.

334
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:53,493
Houses and streets...
and TV.

335
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:55,498
They wouldn't work.

336
00:40:57,268 --> 00:41:02,467
But suppose they wouldn't make
sense, not here on this island.

337
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:07,534
Supposing things
are watching us...

338
00:41:07,611 --> 00:41:09,545
and waiting.

339
00:41:11,215 --> 00:41:13,149
Go on being chief, Ralph.

340
00:41:13,217 --> 00:41:15,208
Who's there?

341
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:17,220
Me, Simon.

342
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:23,453
I wish my auntie were here.

343
00:41:23,527 --> 00:41:26,121
Oh, what's the use?

344
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:29,559
Grown-ups know things.

345
00:41:29,633 --> 00:41:32,602
They ain't afraid
of the dark.

346
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,730
They'd meet and have tea
and discuss.

347
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,775
Then things would be
all right.

348
00:42:43,934 --> 00:42:44,866
Sam.

349
00:42:44,935 --> 00:42:46,869
What's the matter?

350
00:42:46,937 --> 00:42:48,871
Shh.

351
00:43:13,096 --> 00:43:16,793
- It was furry.
- There was something moving...

352
00:43:16,867 --> 00:43:19,893
behind his head-- wings.

353
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:22,461
It sort of sat up.

354
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:27,067
It had eyes, teeth, claws.

355
00:43:27,144 --> 00:43:31,945
We ran as fast as we could,
bashed into things.

356
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:34,074
The beast followed us.

357
00:43:34,151 --> 00:43:36,381
Then he caught me.

358
00:43:37,287 --> 00:43:40,484
You're not pulling our legs,
are you?

359
00:43:42,492 --> 00:43:45,723
- We'll hunt it. Who'll come?
- Me! Me!

360
00:43:45,796 --> 00:43:49,630
But those sticks, they're made of wood.
Don't be so silly.

361
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:50,631
Frightened?

362
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:52,634
Of course I am.
Who wouldn't be?

363
00:43:52,702 --> 00:43:53,828
Come on. Let's go.

364
00:43:53,904 --> 00:43:56,065
Who'll mind the little ones?

365
00:43:56,139 --> 00:43:59,631
- Piggy will.
- Right. Keep Piggy out of danger.

366
00:43:59,709 --> 00:44:01,643
Haven't you got any sense?

367
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:04,646
How can Piggy help
with only one eye?

368
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:11,009
Jack, is there anywhere on this
island where we haven't been?

369
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:13,022
There's only--
Of course!

370
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,650
The tail end part,
where the rocks pile up.

371
00:45:04,074 --> 00:45:06,668
I'm chief.
I'll go in alone.

372
00:45:06,743 --> 00:45:09,678
The rest of you
wait here and hide.

373
00:45:15,218 --> 00:45:17,379
Do you think--

374
00:45:17,454 --> 00:45:20,582
I've been all over.
It must be here.

375
00:45:27,564 --> 00:45:31,557
I... don't believe
in the beast.

376
00:45:33,336 --> 00:45:35,270
I suppose not.

377
00:46:44,274 --> 00:46:46,242
Couldn't let you do it
on your own.

378
00:47:11,668 --> 00:47:13,602
What a place for a fort!

379
00:47:22,479 --> 00:47:24,413
The beast isn't here.

380
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:28,474
- Let's get the others and go to the top.
- Boys!

381
00:47:35,825 --> 00:47:40,455
Now, this story is about
the place where I live,

382
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:42,998
called Camberley.

383
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:46,433
Now, Camberley is
quite an old place,

384
00:47:46,503 --> 00:47:50,166
but it hasn't been called
Camberley all the time.

385
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,267
It used to be called
Cambridgetown.

386
00:47:54,344 --> 00:47:58,041
And they used to get mixed up
with the letters...

387
00:47:58,114 --> 00:48:02,414
between Cambridge
or Cambridgetown.

388
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:06,581
So letters that were to a person
in Cambridgetown...

389
00:48:06,656 --> 00:48:10,649
used to go to a person
in Cambridge.

390
00:48:10,727 --> 00:48:14,686
So they got a bit mixed up.
So they thought they'd change...

391
00:48:14,764 --> 00:48:17,494
the name at the post office,
because it was a post office...

392
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:21,401
that had all the trouble
of sorting the letters.

393
00:48:21,471 --> 00:48:26,374
And they thought they'd leave
the "cam" from Cambridgetown,

394
00:48:26,443 --> 00:48:27,535
and they--

395
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,100
"ber" is a river,

396
00:48:29,179 --> 00:48:31,909
and there are a lot of rivers
around there.

397
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:39,513
"Camber". And then "ley," because often
the towns near there ended with "ley".

398
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:41,750
Their names ended
with "ley".

399
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:45,488
So they called it
Cam-ber-ley. Camberley.

400
00:48:45,562 --> 00:48:47,689
And that's the true story
of Camberley.

401
00:48:59,743 --> 00:49:01,768
I don't think we should leave
Piggy with the little ones.

402
00:49:01,845 --> 00:49:03,335
Not all night.

403
00:49:03,413 --> 00:49:07,349
We mustn't let anything
happen to Piggy, must we?

404
00:49:07,417 --> 00:49:12,821
I think someone should go back and tell
them we won't be back till after dark.

405
00:49:14,224 --> 00:49:16,658
I'll go.
I don't mind.

406
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:18,717
Honestly.

407
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:48,723
We'll go to the beach.

408
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:50,726
We can go to the top tomorrow.

409
00:49:50,794 --> 00:49:53,092
If you're frightened, of course.

410
00:49:53,163 --> 00:49:55,495
All right, then.
Who wants to go now?

411
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,065
You see?

412
00:49:59,135 --> 00:50:01,933
I'm going to climb the mountain
to look for the beast now.

413
00:50:02,005 --> 00:50:04,405
- Coming?
- I don't mind.

414
00:50:04,474 --> 00:50:06,533
If you don't mind, of course.

415
00:50:06,609 --> 00:50:07,940
Not at all!

416
00:50:11,047 --> 00:50:13,914
I think it's silly
only two of us go.

417
00:50:13,983 --> 00:50:18,477
If we meet anything
on the other side, two won't be enough.

418
00:50:24,093 --> 00:50:27,153
All right.
Come along, Roger.

419
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,674
If you don't want to go on,
I'll go myself.

420
00:50:46,749 --> 00:50:50,241
Go on, then.
We'll wait here.

421
00:51:00,497 --> 00:51:02,431
Shut up.

422
00:51:09,873 --> 00:51:12,137
I saw a thing on top.

423
00:51:12,208 --> 00:51:15,666
There was a noise too.
Kind of...

424
00:51:40,336 --> 00:51:43,271
Keep close to the ground.

425
00:51:49,879 --> 00:51:53,042
Over there, capping the rock.

426
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:30,016
First, you know now
we've seen the beast.

427
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:34,957
We crawled up.
We were only a few feet away.

428
00:52:35,024 --> 00:52:37,390
The beast sat up
and looked at us.

429
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,897
I don't think we could fight a thing
that size. Honestly, you know.

430
00:52:41,965 --> 00:52:45,901
We're talk.
We couldn't fight a tiger.

431
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:49,735
We'd hide.
Even Jack would hide.

432
00:52:49,806 --> 00:52:52,900
- What about my hunters?
- Boys armed with sticks?

433
00:52:52,976 --> 00:52:54,705
All right, then.

434
00:52:56,679 --> 00:53:00,240
He's not a hunter.
He'd never have got us meat.

435
00:53:00,316 --> 00:53:04,082
He's just giving orders,
expects people to obey for nothing.

436
00:53:04,153 --> 00:53:06,951
He's like Piggy.
He says things like Piggy.

437
00:53:07,023 --> 00:53:08,991
He's not a proper chief.
He's a coward.

438
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:12,027
On top, when Roger and me went on,
he stayed back.

439
00:53:12,095 --> 00:53:14,290
- I went too.
- After.

440
00:53:14,364 --> 00:53:17,765
I went on too, then I went away.
So did you.

441
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:20,268
Call me a coward then.
All this talk.

442
00:53:20,336 --> 00:53:22,566
- All this talk, talk, talk.
- Right.

443
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:25,574
I'm not gonna be
part of Ralph's lot.

444
00:53:25,642 --> 00:53:29,942
I'm going off by myself to the rocks
to hunt and have feasts and have fun.

445
00:53:30,013 --> 00:53:32,948
Anyone who wants
can come too.

446
00:53:34,984 --> 00:53:36,918
Jack!

447
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:10,609
I said we could do
without a certain person.

448
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:13,417
Now I think
we've got to decide.

449
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:15,889
We can do without Jack Merridew.

450
00:54:15,958 --> 00:54:19,121
There's others besides him
on this island.

451
00:54:19,195 --> 00:54:21,720
But now we've really
got a beast--

452
00:54:21,798 --> 00:54:24,494
though I can hardly
believe it--

453
00:54:24,567 --> 00:54:27,730
we'll need to stay close
to the platform.

454
00:54:30,473 --> 00:54:33,340
I've been talking, Ralph.

455
00:54:33,409 --> 00:54:34,671
What?

456
00:54:34,744 --> 00:54:37,304
We've got no fire
on the mountain,

457
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,577
but what's wrong
with a fire down here?

458
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:45,587
That's a good idea. We can build it
right here between the shelters.

459
00:54:45,655 --> 00:54:48,988
I think we ought
to climb the mountain.

460
00:54:49,058 --> 00:54:51,993
What's the use?

461
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,666
What else is there to do?

462
00:55:55,825 --> 00:56:00,262
And put some dry leaves on.
Make sure they're dry.

463
00:56:02,732 --> 00:56:05,895
If they're wet,
it won't burn properly.

464
00:56:39,235 --> 00:56:41,169
Come on.

465
00:57:23,246 --> 00:57:25,180
Come on.

466
00:57:52,842 --> 00:57:54,776
Now!

467
00:58:41,457 --> 00:58:43,687
Right up the ass.

468
00:59:01,577 --> 00:59:04,512
Sharpen a stick at both ends.

469
00:59:31,707 --> 00:59:34,403
This head is for the beast.

470
00:59:34,477 --> 00:59:36,707
It's a gift.

471
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:48,657
Can't they see?
Don't they understand?

472
00:59:50,893 --> 00:59:54,556
Unless we keep the smoke burning,
we'll die.

473
00:59:58,034 --> 01:00:00,662
What's wrong, Piggy?

474
01:00:02,204 --> 01:00:05,367
Why are things going
wrong like they are?

475
01:00:07,109 --> 01:00:09,339
I don't know, Ralph.

476
01:00:09,412 --> 01:00:11,437

494
01:02:02,158 --> 01:02:05,093
Looks like we're going to have
a lot of rain, all right.

495
01:02:05,161 --> 01:02:07,686
What about the fire?

496
01:02:22,244 --> 01:02:24,610
Hey, come back!

497
01:02:27,516 --> 01:02:29,643
We wouldn't go back to you--

498
01:02:52,808 --> 01:02:54,742
Wee-wah-wo-wee.

499
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:58,746
Wee-wah-wo-wee.
Wee-wah-wo-wee.

500
01:03:49,498 --> 01:03:52,797
Take 'em some food.

501
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:02,507
Bananas!

502
01:04:05,914 --> 01:04:07,905
Wee-wah-woo-wo!

503
01:04:07,983 --> 01:04:11,248
Wee-wah-woo-wo!
Wee-wah-woo-wo!

504
01:04:17,526 --> 01:04:19,994
Who'll join my tribe?

505
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:26,761
Jack. I'll join your tribe, Jack.

506
01:04:30,773 --> 01:04:33,606
- Who'll join my tribe?
- I will.

507
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:39,638
I gave you food, and my hunters
will protect you from the beast.

508
01:04:41,717 --> 01:04:44,948
- Who'll join my tribe?
- I will, Jack.

509
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:49,548
I'm chief. And what about the fire?
I've got the conch!

510
01:04:49,625 --> 01:04:53,061
You haven't got it with you.
You left it behind.

511
01:04:54,663 --> 01:04:56,597
See? Clever.

512
01:04:58,667 --> 01:05:00,965
Anyway, the conch doesn't count
on this end of the island.

513
01:05:01,036 --> 01:05:04,130
The conch counts here
and all over the island.

514
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,669
Who'll join my tribe?

515
01:05:08,744 --> 01:05:11,008
- Me, me!
- I will!

516
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,640
- Let's join Jack's tribe!
- Yeah!

517
01:05:16,118 --> 01:05:18,643
Come away.
There's going to be trouble.

518
01:07:05,761 --> 01:07:07,922
Kill the beast!

519
01:07:07,996 --> 01:07:10,897
Kill the beast!
Kill the pig!

520
01:07:10,966 --> 01:07:14,561
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

521
01:07:14,636 --> 01:07:17,662
Kill the beast!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

522
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:20,936
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

523
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:24,137
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

524
01:07:24,213 --> 01:07:28,240
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

525
01:07:39,995 --> 01:07:43,328
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

526
01:07:43,398 --> 01:07:46,424
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

527
01:07:46,502 --> 01:07:49,266
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

528
01:07:49,338 --> 01:07:51,738
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

529
01:07:51,807 --> 01:07:54,275
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

530
01:07:54,343 --> 01:07:56,709
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

531
01:07:56,778 --> 01:07:59,144
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

532
01:07:59,214 --> 01:08:01,580
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

533
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,641
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat!

534
01:08:05,954 --> 01:08:08,445
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

535
01:08:08,524 --> 01:08:10,992
Kill the beast! Slit his throat!
Bash it in!

536
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:14,051
Kill the beast!
Slit his throat! Bash it in!

537
01:08:14,129 --> 01:08:18,759
Look! The beast!

538
01:08:53,168 --> 01:08:55,136
Kill! Kill!

539
01:08:55,203 --> 01:08:57,501
Kill! Kill! Kill!

540
01:09:07,916 --> 01:09:10,476
##

541
01:11:08,704 --> 01:11:12,071
Piggy, are you
the only one left?

542
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,608
There are some little ones.

543
01:11:14,676 --> 01:11:17,645
They don't count.
No big ones?

544
01:11:18,914 --> 01:11:22,714
Oh, Sam and Eric.
They're collecting wood.

545
01:11:22,784 --> 01:11:26,379
- Nobody else?
- Not that I know of.

546
01:11:42,537 --> 01:11:44,471
Piggy.

547
01:11:47,175 --> 01:11:49,302
- Piggy.
- Huh?

548
01:11:49,377 --> 01:11:51,572
That was murder.

549
01:11:51,646 --> 01:11:56,208
You stop it! What good are you
doing talking like that?

550
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:02,079
It was dark!
There was that bloody dance!

551
01:12:02,157 --> 01:12:05,888
There was thunder
and lightning and rain!

552
01:12:05,961 --> 01:12:08,225
We were scared!

553
01:12:08,296 --> 01:12:12,528
It wasn't...
what you said.

554
01:12:12,601 --> 01:12:14,933
Oh, Piggy!

555
01:12:16,004 --> 01:12:19,030
It was an accident.

556
01:12:25,313 --> 01:12:27,372
He was batty.

557
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:30,782
He asked for it.
It was an accident.

558
01:12:33,488 --> 01:12:36,082
Oh, God,
I want to go home.

559
01:12:37,459 --> 01:12:39,859
Ow!

560
01:12:39,928 --> 01:12:43,227
Ow! Ow!

561
01:12:46,334 --> 01:12:48,359
Take him away!

562
01:13:03,118 --> 01:13:05,211
Tomorrow, I'll hunt again.

563
01:13:06,588 --> 01:13:09,318
Then we'll leave another head
for the beast.

564
01:13:17,265 --> 01:13:20,598
Some of you will stay
and defend the gate.

565
01:13:21,803 --> 01:13:24,670
The beast may try
and come in.

566
01:13:30,645 --> 01:13:32,738
Remember how he crawled?

567
01:13:32,814 --> 01:13:35,908
He came disguised.

568
01:13:35,984 --> 01:13:38,919
The beast may try and come,

569
01:13:38,987 --> 01:13:42,081
even though we gave him
the head of our kill to eat.

570
01:13:42,157 --> 01:13:44,387
So watch and be careful.

571
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:50,523
But didn't we--
Didn't we--

572
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:55,426
No. How could we kill it?

573
01:14:00,442 --> 01:14:04,378
He told us.
The beast was disguised.

574
01:14:06,248 --> 01:14:10,344
Tomorrow, when we get meat,
we'll have a feast.

575
01:14:12,621 --> 01:14:14,816
- Chief?
- Yes, Bill?

576
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:17,825
What'll we use
to light the fire?

577
01:14:17,893 --> 01:14:21,351
We'll get fire
from the others.

578
01:14:23,331 --> 01:14:25,322
We've got to get
out of this.

579
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:27,334
What do you mean?

580
01:14:27,402 --> 01:14:30,132
Get rescued.

581
01:14:30,205 --> 01:14:32,639
I mean it.

582
01:14:32,707 --> 01:14:36,507
If we don't get out of here soon,
we'll be barmy.

583
01:14:36,578 --> 01:14:39,479
- Around the bend.
- Crackers.

584
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:50,981
Have you written a letter
to your auntie lately?

585
01:14:51,059 --> 01:14:53,289
I don't know
where she is now,

586
01:14:53,361 --> 01:14:57,263
and I haven't got
an envelope or a stamp,

587
01:14:57,332 --> 01:15:00,699
and there isn't
a pillar box or a postman.

588
01:15:02,837 --> 01:15:05,601
I haven't said
anything very funny.

589
01:15:09,844 --> 01:15:15,680
Piggy-y-y-y!

590
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:17,843
Piggy!

591
01:15:19,821 --> 01:15:22,119
Don't make a sound.

592
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,681
We're going
to get you, Piggy.

593
01:15:26,761 --> 01:15:28,991
Piggy?

594
01:15:29,064 --> 01:15:32,033
Where are you, Piggy?

595
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:35,331
We've come to get you.

596
01:15:45,714 --> 01:15:49,115
Ow! Ow! Ow!

597
01:16:03,598 --> 01:16:06,192
Piggy, you've changed!

598
01:16:06,267 --> 01:16:08,758
Piggy!

599
01:17:20,008 --> 01:17:23,375
I just take the conch
to say this.

600
01:17:23,445 --> 01:17:26,972
I can't see
without my glasses,

601
01:17:27,048 --> 01:17:29,949
and I got to get them back.

602
01:17:30,018 --> 01:17:32,885
What are we going to do?

603
01:17:54,609 --> 01:17:56,702
Hey! Who goes there?

604
01:17:56,778 --> 01:18:00,612
Stop being silly!
You can see who I am!

605
01:18:16,264 --> 01:18:18,698
I'm calling an assembly!

606
01:18:18,766 --> 01:18:21,098
Boo! Boo!

607
01:18:29,544 --> 01:18:32,206
Don't leave me, Ralph!

608
01:18:35,016 --> 01:18:38,076
You sit down
and wait for me. Here.

609
01:18:44,592 --> 01:18:47,026
What do you want?

610
01:18:47,095 --> 01:18:51,498
Go away, Ralph!
You keep to your end.

611
01:18:51,566 --> 01:18:56,196
This is my end and my tribe.
You have to leave me alone.

612
01:18:56,271 --> 01:19:00,230
You took Piggy's specs.
You've got to give them back.

613
01:19:00,308 --> 01:19:03,243
Got to? Who says?

614
01:19:03,311 --> 01:19:06,371
I say!
That was a dirty trick.

615
01:19:06,447 --> 01:19:09,382
We would have given you fire
if you asked for it.

616
01:19:09,450 --> 01:19:12,351
But you didn't.
You came sneaking up like a thief.

617
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:15,355
- Say that again!
- Thief! Thief!

618
01:19:15,423 --> 01:19:17,550
Who's a thief?

619
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:19,559
You are!

620
01:19:20,795 --> 01:19:24,993
Ralph!
Remember what we came for.

621
01:19:25,066 --> 01:19:27,830
The fire. My specs.

622
01:19:27,902 --> 01:19:30,996
Don't you see? There may be
a ship out there or a plane!

623
01:19:38,813 --> 01:19:41,407
- Grab 'em!
- Jack!

624
01:19:41,482 --> 01:19:43,814
Tie 'em up!

625
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:49,089
See?
They do what I want.

626
01:19:49,157 --> 01:19:52,718
You're a beast and a swine
and a bloody, bloody thief!

627
01:19:55,930 --> 01:19:58,364
Boo! Boo!

628
01:19:58,433 --> 01:20:01,129
Go, Jack! Go!

629
01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:24,280
Let me speak!

630
01:20:24,359 --> 01:20:26,793
I've got the conch!

631
01:20:42,644 --> 01:20:45,135
Which is it better to be?

632
01:20:45,213 --> 01:20:49,513
A pack of panting savages
like you are...

633
01:20:50,718 --> 01:20:52,982
or sensible like Ralph is?

634
01:20:53,054 --> 01:20:56,285
Which is better?

635
01:20:56,357 --> 01:21:00,623
To have rules and agree,
or to hunt and kill?

636
01:21:11,973 --> 01:21:15,500
Piggy!

637
01:22:33,321 --> 01:22:36,256
Sam and Eric!
Hey, Sam and Eric.

638
01:22:36,324 --> 01:22:38,849
It's me, Ralph.

639
01:22:42,830 --> 01:22:45,230
When they find me,
what are they going to do?

640
01:22:46,868 --> 01:22:49,837
Roger sharpened a stick
at both ends.

641
01:22:49,904 --> 01:22:53,169
They're going to hurt you tomorrow.

642
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:58,037
We've got to give signals
woo-woo-woo!

643
01:22:58,112 --> 01:23:00,307
Only louder, of course.

644
01:23:00,381 --> 01:23:03,009
You've got to go now, Ralph.

645
01:23:07,088 --> 01:23:09,579
Won't you come with me?

646
01:23:09,657 --> 01:23:13,354
Three of us would have
a better chance.

647
01:23:13,428 --> 01:23:15,362
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

648
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:16,863
Quick, Ralph!

649
01:23:16,931 --> 01:23:19,866
I'll be that thicket.
They won't think to look so close.

650
01:23:19,934 --> 01:23:22,334
- Who's there?
- Attention!

651
01:23:22,403 --> 01:23:25,133
Eric, it's Roger.

652
01:23:25,206 --> 01:23:28,107
Here. Take this.

653
01:23:30,044 --> 01:23:32,444
Attention!

654
01:23:33,614 --> 01:23:36,048
Scouts' report.

655
01:23:36,117 --> 01:23:39,052
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

656
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:56,226
Come here!

657
01:23:56,304 --> 01:23:59,432
Got Piggy's specs?
I'll start a fire.

658
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:04,901
He must be in here somewhere.

659
01:24:04,979 --> 01:24:09,006
You go around that way.
We'll smoke him out.

660
01:24:13,654 --> 01:24:16,589
Shhh. Something's moved.

661
01:24:16,657 --> 01:24:19,490
Roger, come help.

662
01:24:22,263 --> 01:24:24,197
Got the stick?

663
01:24:34,842 --> 01:24:37,072
I told you.
He's dangerous.

664
01:24:41,415 --> 01:24:44,714
Woo-woo-woo-woo!
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

665
01:24:44,785 --> 01:24:48,448
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!

666
01:24:48,523 --> 01:24:51,788
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

667
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:24,724
Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!

668
01:25:41,742 --> 01:25:44,643
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

669
01:25:44,712 --> 01:25:47,476
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

670
01:25:47,548 --> 01:25:49,846
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat!

671
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:36,461
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

672
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:39,795
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

673
01:26:39,867 --> 01:26:43,200
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

674
01:26:43,270 --> 01:26:46,603
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

675
01:26:46,674 --> 01:26:49,973
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

676
01:26:50,044 --> 01:26:53,377
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

677
01:26:53,447 --> 01:26:56,746
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

678
01:26:56,817 --> 01:26:59,911
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

679
01:26:59,987 --> 01:27:03,252
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

680
01:27:03,324 --> 01:27:06,589
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

681
01:27:06,661 --> 01:27:09,824
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

682
01:27:09,897 --> 01:27:12,764
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

683
01:27:12,833 --> 01:27:14,892
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

684
01:27:14,969 --> 01:27:16,994
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

685
01:27:17,071 --> 01:27:19,335
Kill the pig!
Slit her throat! Bash her in!

686
01:27:19,407 --> 01:27:21,432
Kill the pig! Slit her throat!
Bash her in!

687
01:27:21,509 --> 01:27:23,670
Kill the pig--

688
01:28:55,703 --> 01:28:58,365

1
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,945
Spend all day with us.

2
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:35,451
There are two of everything
in every Noah's Arcade.

3
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:40,039
That means two of Zantar,
Bay Wolf, Ninja Commando,

4
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,250
Snake-azon, Psycho Chopper...

5
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,126
It's good seeing you, Benjamin.

6
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,963
You haven't been to Shakey's
for so long.

7
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:48,297
Well, I've been real busy.

8
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,842
It's two for you cos one won't do.

9
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:54,929
All this week,
kids under six get every fifth...

10
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:59,725
There's a new pet.
Chia Pet, the pottery that grows...

11
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,603
.. they are very fast.

12
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:07,525
.. simple. Plug it in,
insert the plug from anything.

13
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,859
Simple.

14
00:01:08,986 --> 00:01:11,696
.. even for our customers
in Waukegan, Elgin and Aurora,

15
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,740
we'll be there right on time.
So call!

16
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,957
Wayne's world! Wayne's world!
Party time. Excellent.

17
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,922
- All right. Excellent.
- Excellent.

18
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,550
OK. Extreme close-up!

19
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,477
- Excellent.
- Excellent extreme close-up.

20
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:47,565
Now it's Wayne's World Totally
Amazing Excellent Discoveries.

21
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:51,444
Our guest is Ron Paxton.
Welcome to Wayne's World, Ron.

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,862
Thanks, Wayne.

23
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:57,450
You're the inventor of
the Suck Kut, right? What is it?

24
00:01:57,576 --> 00:02:00,453
The Suck Kut is a revolution
in home hair cutting.

25
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:04,123
Wow! What a totally amazing
excellent discovery.

26
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,458
Yes.

27
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,379
Fireworks!

28
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,925
Now, Ron, the question on everybody's
mind is, how does it work?

29
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:18,429
I'm prepared for
a complete demonstration.

30
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,849
Garth, sit there. He's gonna
put that thing on your melon, OK?

31
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,686
Just a trim. Don't buzz me.

32
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,361
So tell me, Ron.
Exactly how does the Suck Kut work?

33
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:37,657
Well, as you can see,
it sucks as it cuts.

34
00:02:37,783 --> 00:02:40,117
It certainly does suck.

35
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,122
- What is this?
- Wayne's World.

36
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,333
They do it from their basement.

37
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,465
- People watch this?
- Yeah, lots.

38
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:58,302
Turn it off, man! Turn it off!
It's sucking my will to live!

39
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,013
Oh, the humanity!

40
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:05,559
- You want to hand me the telephone?
- Sure.

41
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,856
Russell? It's Benjamin.
Are you watching TV?

42
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,151
Listen, could you turn it
to channel 10?

43
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:18,030
I want you to find out who these guys
are and where they do their show.

44
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,658
I think we can sell it to Vanderhoff.

45
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:24,537
Take your Ritalin, OK?
You're in a forest.

46
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:27,081
- Forest?
- With Heather Locklear.

47
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:31,335
- With Heather?
- And you're very warm. Very... warm.

48
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:36,424
- These guys are so funny.
- They're obviously brilliant.

49
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,933
Wow! What a totally amazing
excellent discovery... not!

50
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,477
Thanks, Ron.

51
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,064
Time's up for this week.
Until then, good night!

52
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,150
- Party on, Wayne.
- Party on, Garth.

53
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,910
And... we're clear!

54
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:08,289
- All right!
- Excellent!

55
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,584
- All right! Excellent!
- Excellent!

56
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:15,629
Let me bring you up to speed.
My name is Wayne Campbell.

57
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:19,842
I live in Aurora, Illinois,
which is a suburb of Chicago.

58
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,596
Excellent.
I've had plenty ofjoe jobs.

59
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:28,142
Nothing I'd call a career.
Let me put it this way...

60
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:33,022
I have an extensive collection
of name tags and hairnets.

61
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:40,571
I still live with my parents,
which I admit is both bogus and sad,

62
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:43,491
but I've got an amazing
cable access show,

63
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,576
and I still know how to party.

64
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:49,205
But what I'd really love
is to do Wayne's World for a living.

65
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:54,168
It might happen. Sh'yeah,
and monkeys might fly out of my butt.

66
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,211
Ah, the mirthmobile.

67
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,888
- This is my best friend Garth Algar.
- Hi.

68
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,683
I think a little Bohemian Rhapsody,
gentlemen.

69
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,185
Good call.

70
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,054
Whoa! It's Phil.

71
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:55,646
Phil, what are you doing here?
You're partied out, man... again.

72
00:05:55,772 --> 00:06:00,067
- What if he honks in the car?
- I'm giving you a no-honk guarantee.

73
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:08,284
Phil, if you're gonna spew,
spew into this.

74
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:09,219
- Garth, pull over.
- Oh, man! Come on!

75
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:10,596
Not again.

76
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:19,647
He does this every Friday.
Stop torturing yourself, man!

77
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,859
You'll never afford it!
Live in the now!

78
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:31,158
It will be mine.
Oh, yes... It will be mine.

79
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:14,827
Wayne's World!
Wayne's World! Party!

80
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,957
Excellent! Way to go!

81
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,128
Party on, Wayne!

82
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,759
Campbell. Uno momento, fellas.

83
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,388
- Officer Koharski, how's it going?
- Fine.

84
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:39,143
Say, I smell bacon.
Does anyone else smell bacon?

85
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,688
Yeah, I definitely smell
a pork product of some type.

86
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,190
Yeah, yeah. I know what you're doing.

87
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,570
Bacon, pig, oink-oink,
police officer.

88
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,864
I said that to cops
when I was your age.

89
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:53,991
What are you up to?

90
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,495
Me? I just pulled over a tour bus
on its way to Chicago.

91
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,707
We had a tip there was some
drug smuggling going down.

92
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,250
We searched the vehicle.

93
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,754
It was clean,
so we did body cavity searches.

94
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,756
- No way.
- Way!

95
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:11,759
I inspected 12 individuals,
inside and out.

96
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:20,017
This guy needs coffee
and crullers stat!

97
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:22,853
We got to get him to rampart.
Let's go!

98
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:29,568
This is Stan Mikita's Donuts.
Excellent munch post.

99
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:35,199
This is the manager, Glen.
He's here 24 hours a day.

100
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,161
I recommend the sugar pucks.
They're excellent. Come on.

101
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:43,415
I'd never done a crazy thing
in my life before that night.

102
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:47,086
Why is it if a man kills another
in battle it's called heroic,

103
00:09:47,212 --> 00:09:50,047
yet in the heat of passion
it's called murder?

104
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:52,883
Hello!
What do you think you're doing?

105
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:56,887
Only me and Garth get
to talk to the camera. Come on.

106
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:03,060
I don't really have too much
to say right now. What's that?

107
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,523
Hi, Mr Withers.
How's the amusement park?

108
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,650
Just great, Wayne.

109
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,987
Four coffees
and a half dozen crullers, please.

110
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:16,115
And one jelly donut.

111
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:21,286
There's your girlfriend, Garth.
Sh'yeah!

112
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:45,894
Excuse me. I fell.

113
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:49,231
Don't you guys ever get tired
of ordering the same thing?

114
00:10:49,357 --> 00:10:51,650
No.

115
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,695
- Uh-oh. Don't look. Stacy.
- Where?

116
00:10:55,947 --> 00:11:00,993
- Oh, God. I made eye contact.
- Psycho hose beast.

117
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,292
Happy anniversary, Wayne.

118
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,045
- We broke up two months ago.
- It doesn't mean we can't go out.

119
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,716
Well, it does, actually.
That's what breaking up is.

120
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:17,885
You going to the Gasworks tonight?

121
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,511
- No!
- No!

122
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,639
Don't you wanna open your present?

123
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,976
If it's a severed head,
I'll be very upset.

124
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,396
- Open it.
- OK. OK.

125
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,819
- What is it?
- It's a gun rack.

126
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:40,908
A gun rack? A gun rack.
Sh'yeah, great.

127
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:42,826
I don't even own a gun,

128
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:46,079
let alone many guns
necessitating an entire rack.

129
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,791
What am I gonna do with a gun rack?

130
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:54,004
You don't like it? Fine.

131
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,591
Wayne, if you're not careful,
you're gonna lose me.

132
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,885
I lost you two months ago.

133
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,805
Are you mental?
We broke up. Get the net!

134
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:26,119
Wayne! How you doing? Garth!

135
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:31,291
- Tiny, who's playing tonight?
- Jolly Green Giants, Shitty Beatles.

136
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,794
The Shitty Beatles?
Are they any good?

137
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:37,297
- They suck.
- Then it's not just a clever name?

138
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,884
- Who else?
- Crucial Taunt, just finishing.

139
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:44,221
- I hear they can wail.
- You're right. Party on.

140
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,265
Party on.

141
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,321
This is the Gasworks,
an excellent heavy metal bar.

142
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,658
- Always a babefest.
- And they got a pool table, too.

143
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:13,792
Party! Excuse me.

144
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,385
Excuse me. Excuse me.

145
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,637
- What?
- I'd like to get by now.

146
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,016
Get out of my face, you little dweeb.

147
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,148
Excuse me.

148
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,527
What do you want, you little dweeb?

149
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,331
Thank you.

150
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:49,012
She's a babe!

151
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,980
Fight! Fight! Fight!

152
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,158
All right.

153
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,121
I love this woman.

154
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:02,878
Raymond, club soda with a lime, please.
And would you get me a towel?

155
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,423
- Boy, you really wail.
- Thanks.

156
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:09,509
You're that party time guy on TV.
Wayne, right?

157
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,054
- Yes, and you are?
- Cassandra.

158
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:17,976
Rough night, huh?
Everybody's kung fu fighting.

159
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,521
Yeah. Well, nice meeting you.

160
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,857
Hey, hold on!
Can I call you sometime?

161
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,193
For $5, come to the rent party.

162
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,030
- It's at my loft.
- I'm there.

163
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:36,077
I gotta go. The owner's
trying to dick me out of some money.

164
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,955
See how many people I brought in?

165
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:44,252
That bass player's a babe.
She makes me feel kind of funny.

166
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,964
Like when we used to climb the rope
in gym class.

167
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,634
You said I get cash up front.

168
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:56,181
She will be mine.
Oh, yes... She will be mine.

169
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,279
Pardon me.
Do you have any Grey Poupon?

170
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,972
Garth, sit there.
He's gonna put that on your melon.

171
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,225
Just a trim. Don't buzz me, OK?

172
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:52,821
Russell, stop the tape.
So, what do you think?

173
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,992
I think it's two chimps
on a davenport in a basement.

174
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,493
I'm not sponsoring this.

175
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,955
I got spots on Love Boat, but this?
What is this?

176
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,708
Mr Vanderhoff, this is your audience.

177
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:07,377
The same kids that line up
at Noah's Arcade.

178
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,130
- It looks so cheesy.
- That's where I come in.

179
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,426
Russell's our best producer. He does
Chicago PM with Elaine Ronkey,

180
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:17,637
Sunshine Saturday,
The African American Digest.

181
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,681
- Never heard of that.
- It's on late.

182
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,184
- It won several awards.
- I'll stick with Love Boat.

183
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:27,772
If I may, speaking
from a producer-director standpoint,

184
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:31,860
kids can relate to this show.
These guys aren't phonies.

185
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:34,154
Kids can spot phonies.
They're very smart.

186
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,574
Kids know dick.
I watch 'em in my arcades.

187
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,745
They stand like lab rats hitting
the feeder bar to get food pellets.

188
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,040
As long as they pump in quarters,
who gives a shit?

189
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,584
Let me ask you.

190
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,421
What's your single biggest problem
in the arcade business?

191
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:56,009
Well, keeping the customer
informed of new product.

192
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,011
Like our new game called Zantar.

193
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:02,223
Zantar is a gelatinous cube
that eats warriors in a village.

194
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,768
If you eat a chieftain,
you go up a level.

195
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:07,395
Beauty is, you can't
get to the next level,

196
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,689
so kids keep coughing up quarters.

197
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,694
Gelatinous cube eats village.
It's terrific.

198
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,781
I know nothing about video games.
I found that riveting.

199
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:20,825
- I do my own commercials.
- I did not know that.

200
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,161
I don't mention the games

201
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:26,331
because the technology moves
faster than the advertising.

202
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:29,125
I did not realise that.
Russell, did you?

203
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,461
No, I did not realise that.

204
00:19:31,629 --> 00:19:35,256
So, Mr Vanderhoff, let me see
if I'm hearing you correctly.

205
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:39,386
Are you saying that
if you had a spot on a weekly show,

206
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:44,724
you could come on and update the kids
on what was new in your arcade?

207
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,063
- Yeah, that's it.
- Well, I'm impressed.

208
00:19:51,524 --> 00:19:55,527
Noah's Arcade presents Wayne's World.
I think that's brilliant.

209
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,945
Brilliant.

210
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:00,240
- Well, thank you.
- We'll get right to work on this.

211
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:03,993
We'll send the contracts over.
We'll be in touch.

212
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,289
I'd like to think about this.

213
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:12,419
Of course you would.
I wouldn't have it any other way.

214
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:17,006
- She'll validate you.
- Thank you.

215
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,761
He's in.

216
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,354
Stop it! You're scaring me.

217
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:33,857
Oh, cool. You're learning
Cassandra's language.

218
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,861
I've never seen you so mental
over a girl before.

219
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,280
Are you gonna marry her?

220
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:43,491
Marriage is punishment
for shoplifting in some countries.

221
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,661
- OK, you passed inspection.
- All right.

222
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:51,791
Just barely. OK, that's $42.57, Wayne,
parts and labour.

223
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,960
- No way.
- Brutal.

224
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,880
- OK. There you go.
- All right, we got it.

225
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,631
That's not enough.

226
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:01,968
- We got... that.
- That's good, but I need more.

227
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,680
- Oh, man! Why don't you use a gun?
- It's not my fault. Come on.

228
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:10,059
- I suppose it's society's fault?
- More.

229
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,855
- Cool.
- All right.

230
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,690
Well, here's an extra dollar.

231
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,987
You guys shoulda been
at Gasworks Friday.

232
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:24,157
- Yeah, we were.
- This band, Crucial Taunt.

233
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:27,076
They had this megababe
lead singer, unreal!

234
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,122
Phil, we were there.
Have you gone mental? Hello?

235
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,417
- I think we should go now.
- Here you go.

236
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:55,021
You think it's wise
to sell a show we don't own?

237
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,274
By tonight, we will.

238
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,993
Excuse me. Do you know where
we could find Wayne Campbell?

239
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,455
- That's privileged information.
- Where do they broadcast from?

240
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:16,584
- Are you a friend or a relative?
- We're neither.

241
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:21,464
You know, Russell,
I may not have grown up around here,

242
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,843
but I understand these people.

243
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,554
This must be the place.

244
00:22:30,641 --> 00:22:32,475
OK, we're just about
out of time, right?

245
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,854
But let's give
a Wayne's World salute

246
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,941
to the Guess? jeans girl,
Claudia Schiffer.

247
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:44,904
- Tent pole! She's a babe.
- She's magically babelicious.

248
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,158
She tested very high
on the strokability scale.

249
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,414
Are you through yet?
I'm getting tired of holding this.

250
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:57,500
Yeah, that's what she said.

251
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:02,589
OK, so Claudia Schiffer,
we salute you.

252
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,886
OK, that's all, good night.

253
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:09,470
- Party on, Wayne.
- Party on, Garth.

254
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,023
And... we're clear.

255
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,484
- OK. Excellent show, everyone.
- Excellent.

256
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:27,447
Great show. Wayne, Benjamin Kane.

257
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:30,700
Regional Programme Director,
Oliver Communications.

258
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,578
Russell Findley. We spoke today. Hi.

259
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:36,623
Maybe we can go somewhere
and get acquainted?

260
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,792
Russell, get to know the crew.
You know anywhere nice?

261
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,712
- Hi. Hi.
- See you guys later!

262
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:48,593
Let me get this out of the way...

263
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,387
- I'm a big fan.
- You are?

264
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,141
The way I see it,
your show's capable of so much more.

265
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:58,853
We'll try harder, OK?
Give us a second chance.

266
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:01,230
Don't cancel us
without a second chance.

267
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:04,359
Garth, come on, relax, all right?
Your pills?

268
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:07,320
He can't cancel us.
We're on public access.

269
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:11,032
Can I be honest?
Myjob, it's usually such a bore.

270
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,993
But the other day something
incredible happened.

271
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,245
- What happened?
- Noah Vanderhoff,

272
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:20,041
owner of the largest video arcade
chain in Chicago, is in my office.

273
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:24,671
He asks me, "What's with this
Wayne's World I hear so much about?"

274
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:29,092
Well, I have all your shows on tape.
Like I said, I'm a fan.

275
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:32,428
I put a show in.
He literallyjumped out of his seat.

276
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,888
Cool!

277
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:37,558
He wants to sponsor the show,
put you on our station,

278
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,560
and pay you guys a huge salary.

279
00:24:39,687 --> 00:24:43,439
He doesn't realise you're artists,
not interested in money.

280
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:47,026
- No, we're not interested in money.
- That's what I told him.

281
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:52,740
But he said, "Take two cheques anyway
so they know I'm serious. "

282
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:57,036
I may be wasting my time,
but here I am with the contract

283
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:02,458
and two cashier's cheques
for $5,000 each.

284
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,003
Exsqueeze me? Baking powder?

285
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,922
You're gonna pay us
for doing Wayne's World?!

286
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,842
Give me the word.
I'll tear up these cheques.

287
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,180
He shoots, he scores!

288
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,184
Well. Would you like
to look at the contracts?

289
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,769
- Yes.
- Do you have a lawyer?

290
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,898
Yes. Uh... no.
We're between lawyers right now.

291
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:29,694
Our first lawyer
screwed our affairs so badly.

292
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:35,116
I walked right into that office,
I grabbed him by his big fat head,

293
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:39,579
and I said, "I'm not going to jail
for you or anybody!"

294
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,665
Exactly.

295
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,044
Can I peruse that contract
before we sign it?

296
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:56,387
Yes... Yes.
I like what you've done here.

297
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:02,894
- Yes... Yes...
- I dropped my pen.

298
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:07,690
I'm not so sure about...
Oh, I see. I see.

299
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:12,111
Hi. Does this seem weird?
Why does he have contracts?

300
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,697
Ever see the Twilight Zone
where the guy signed a contract

301
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,825
and they cut out his tongue
and it wouldn't die,

302
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,621
it grew and pulsated
and gave birth to baby tongues?

303
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:26,375
- Pretty cool, huh? I gotta go.
- I like this part.

304
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,588
Well, I feel we can work with you
on this project.

305
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,592
Well, you've made Mr Vanderhoff
a very happy man.

306
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:41,015
- To Wayne's World.
- To Wayne's World!

307
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:44,727
We got $5,000, we got $5,000

308
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,106
We got $5,000, we got $5,000...

309
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,900
Hey, Wayne. Check it out.

310
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,737
We got $5,000, we got $5,000

311
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,543
Party!

312
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,465
Great party, huh, guys?

313
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,145
Stacy alert!

314
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:31,399
We've been spotted and we're being
pulled in by her tractor beam.

315
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:34,694
- I gotta go.
- We gotta go!

316
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:15,568
God, she's amazing.

317
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:23,409
Wayne. Wayne, Garth told me about
the show, man. I love you, man.

318
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:28,539
- Yeah, and I love you, too, Terry.
- No, I mean it, man. I love you.

319
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:33,878
- No, I mean it. I love you.
- No, you don't, man.

320
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:41,385
Garth, come over here! I think
Terry has something to say to you.

321
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:45,348
- I love you, man.
- Thank you.

322
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,971
- Your vocals are incredible.
- Thanks.

323
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:29,016
You have a very interesting look.

324
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:33,688
- I'm not trying to pick up on you.
- Good thing.

325
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:37,650
No, I'm producing a TV show.
It's in Chicago. Very late night.

326
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:43,656
We need a music act. Here's my card.
Is there a number I can reach you at?

327
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,659
We got fliers at the door.

328
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:52,957
Hello.

329
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:19,358
- Hi. Wanna go somewhere and talk?
- Sure.

330
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:31,245
- What's going on in there?
- Just a minute!

331
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:36,292
We'd like to go to the bathroom,
please... in this century.

332
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:39,503
- How long you been waiting?
- Like, an hour now.

333
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:45,217
- Hi, Garth.
- Hi.

334
00:30:45,344 --> 00:30:49,930
I'm looking for Wayne. He seems to be
going through a difficult phase.

335
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:53,309
- You know what I think it is?
- That you're mental?

336
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:55,478
You know him best. What should I do?

337
00:30:55,604 --> 00:30:57,688
Get over it.
Go out with somebody else.

338
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:01,525
Get over it. Go out with somebody else.
Yeah, thanks. OK, great.

339
00:31:03,487 --> 00:31:04,945
Hi.

340
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:08,657
So who's this guy Benjamin?

341
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,452
One of the most important
producers in TV.

342
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,121
He's way ahead of his time.
We've signed with him.

343
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,459
- He's based in Chicago.
- He's interested in the band.

344
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:21,754
Of course. I love your band.
You guys wail.

345
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,799
- Thanks.
- You kick ass. Double live gonzo!

346
00:31:24,925 --> 00:31:27,385
Intensity in 10 cities.
Live at Budokan.

347
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:30,429
If you got a break, you could make it.

348
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,891
And if a frog had wings,
he wouldn't bump his ass hopping.

349
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:38,270
Interesting.
Where did you learn English?

350
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,774
College.
And the Police Academy movies.

351
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:53,452
I've got something
I want to say to you.

352
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:05,756
Campbell, that's amazing! You learned
to say I look pretty in Cantonese.

353
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:21,355
- Hi, Wayne!
- Hello, Stacy.

354
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,441
Here, sit right here.

355
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,798
- You make me laugh.
- Can I call you?

356
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:31,842
Any time.

357
00:33:36,306 --> 00:33:38,641
Look out!

358
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:27,481
Sometimes I wish I could boldly go
where no man's gone before.

359
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,859
But I'll probably stay in Aurora.

360
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:35,072
- What are you thinking about?
- Cassandra.

361
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:39,201
She's a fox.
In France, she'd be called la renard.

362
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,121
Hunted, with only her cunning
to protect her.

363
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:45,124
- She's a babe.
- She's a Robo Babe.

364
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:48,085
In Latin, she'd be called
Babia Majora.

365
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:53,257
If she were a president,
she'd be Baberaham Lincoln.

366
00:34:58,847 --> 00:35:03,517
Did you find Bugs Bunny attractive
in a dress playing a girl bunny?

367
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:06,937
No.

368
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:17,156
- No.
- Neither did I. I was just asking.

369
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:22,453
- OK. OK. Keep looking up!
- OK.

370
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:49,521
Guys, I will be talking
to the cameramen on the headset.

371
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,690
Terry will give you hand cues.

372
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:56,654
Excuse me, Russell, but I believe
I requested the hand job.

373
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:02,493
Let's go on.
The cue is - watch carefully...

374
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:08,415
Five, four, three...

375
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:14,088
- You didn't say two or one.
- You don't say two or one.

376
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:18,092
- Why not?
- You just don't, OK?

377
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,011
Now, it goes...

378
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,559
Five, four, three...

379
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:35,192
- Good! OK, good.
- All right!

380
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,904
Now, we're ready for rehearsal,
unless there are questions.

381
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:42,825
Yeah... Does this
seem weird to anybody else?

382
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,786
I mean, we're looking down
on Wayne's basement...

383
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:50,582
.. only that's not Wayne's basement.
Isn't that weird?

384
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,377
- That's twisted.
- That's weird, man.

385
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:56,505
Garth, that was a haiku.

386
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:00,676
- Control room.
- Russell.

387
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:04,221
- Hello, Benjamin.
- Finishing with the Vanderhoffs.

388
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:08,142
They'd like to visit rehearsal,
see we're not wasting their money.

389
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:14,148
- Not... a good idea, sir.
- Great!

390
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:19,236
- Come in. Your landing gear is down.
- Just... put that down.

391
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:23,115
Just go away, guys.
Go down to the set.

392
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:27,327
- He's excited you'll see the studio.
- The studio.

393
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:30,122
- That's where the magic happens.
- You've worked in TV?

394
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:34,126
- No, but I watch a lot.
- Of course you do. You're creative.

395
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,879
She came up with the name
Noah's Arcade.

396
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:39,798
I just opened my mouth
and out it came.

397
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:44,344
You're a lucky man, Mr Vanderhoff.

398
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:48,056
All right, can we bring in
the blue screen? Let's try one.

399
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:51,226
Ready to cue Wayne and Garth, and go.

400
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:56,273
- OK.
- In five, four, three...

401
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,986
Good, Terry.
Wayne, Garth, don't count along.

402
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:06,825
- We see your mouths moving. Again.
- In five, four, three...

403
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:10,746
Guys? You're nodding.
Once again, Terry.

404
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,918
In five, four, three, two...

405
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:20,672
Welcome to Wayne's World.
Party on, Garth.

406
00:38:20,799 --> 00:38:24,218
- Party on, Wayne.
- Wayne's World has a new feature.

407
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:26,386
It allows us to travel
through time and space.

408
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:31,350
It's called chromakey, and it's
handy for going to... New York.

409
00:38:31,476 --> 00:38:35,521
- Hey, we're in New York!
- I got a gun. Let's hit Broadway.

410
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:38,690
- I guess kids get this?
- They love it.

411
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:41,360
Or maybe you prefer Hawaii.

412
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:45,906
Mookalakaheeki. Come on, you wanna
lei me. Pass the poi, Mahalo.

413
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:48,158
Or say you want to go to Texas.

414
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,954
Howdy, partners.
Let's raise and rope broncos.

415
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,123
- Let's go down.
- Howdy, y'all.

416
00:38:55,291 --> 00:39:00,504
Or imagine being magically
whisked away to... Delaware.

417
00:39:01,506 --> 00:39:04,925
Hi. I'm in Delaware.

418
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:09,763
Noah and Mimi Vanderhoff, say hello
to Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar.

419
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,765
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

420
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:15,853
So, Garth, how do you like
being in a real studio?

421
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:22,234
It's like a new pair of underwear.
At first it's constrictive,

422
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,237
but after a while,
it becomes a part of you.

423
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,993
- I gotta go.
- OK.

424
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,413
No, no, no. Please.

425
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,958
Wayne, I used to be in meat packing.
Lips and hooves.

426
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,962
One day, I had
a four-hour layover in Tulsa.

427
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:46,758
These airport kids kept pumping
quarters into a game called Pong.

428
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,760
They must've blown 50 bucks.

429
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:53,557
I sat there watching and I said,
"Hell, I'm in the wrong business. "

430
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:56,310
15 years later, I'm a millionaire.

431
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:01,148
- It's so huge!
- Thanks.

432
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,569
- Do I frighten you?
- No.

433
00:40:05,695 --> 00:40:07,237
Do you want me to?

434
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,866
- Noah, I love you on that couch.
- You think?

435
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:16,288
- Noah does all his own commercials.
- I got a new one where I rap.

436
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,207
Come bust a move
where the games are played

437
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,753
It's chill, it's fresh,
it's Noah's Arcade

438
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,756
What do you think of that?

439
00:40:25,882 --> 00:40:29,384
I'd have to say asphinctersezwhat?

440
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,472
- What?
- A sphincter says what?

441
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:37,935
- What?
- Exactly.

442
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:40,854
- We've got a lunch.
- That's what I think of it.

443
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:44,358
- OK.
- Well, it's been a pleasure.

444
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,985
May I say I've had a thrilling day.

445
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,362
- You may.
- Shall we?

446
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:51,573
And may I say your wife's a babe.

447
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,991
- Thank you.
- We have a table.

448
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,925
What is it, girl?

449
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:12,844
Aliens have kidnapped Wayne?

450
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:16,807
I misunderstood.
Wayne's outside. Thanks, girl.

451
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,024
OK! Game on!

452
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,987
- Game on!
- Game on!

453
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:36,868
- He shoots, he scores!
- One for one!

454
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:39,788
- Crowd is going wild!
- Car!

455
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:47,254
- Game on!
- Game on!

456
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,092
- OK.
- Let's go.

457
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:55,303
Worseley cuts down the angle.

458
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,765
- Gretzky shoots!
- Gretzky is denied!

459
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,810
Choked in the open net.

460
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,396
- Wayne?
- Yeah?

461
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:06,940
Do you feel Benjamin's not one of us?

462
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:11,528
Good call. It's as if Benjamin
wants us to be liked by everyone.

463
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,448
Led Zeppelin didn't write tunes
everyone liked.

464
00:42:14,574 --> 00:42:18,577
- They left that to the Bee Gees.
- Car!

465
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,501
- Game on!
- Game on!

466
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,425
- Incoming. Stacy, ten o'clock.
- Hi, Wayne.

467
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,094
Hi.

468
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,851
Are you all right?

469
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:48,523
And she's OK!

470
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:52,736
- Game on!
- Yeah, game on!

471
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:13,173
You know, Garth, you and I
have never really talked.

472
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:18,386
- OK.
- I love what you do on the show.

473
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:22,724
I look at you
and I just laugh and laugh.

474
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,605
Let me run this by you
because you're a sharp guy.

475
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:32,192
I'm thinking about giving Vanderhoff
a weekly interview.

476
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,903
How d'you feel about making a change?

477
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,031
We fear change.

478
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:57,342
Cassandra, I have to say it,
you look excellent.

479
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,971
Thanks. I've been so busy
with my band,

480
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,722
I thought I was getting meningitis.

481
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:05,308
I thought I had mono
for an entire year.

482
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,103
Turned out I was just really bored.

483
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:14,109
Excuse me?

484
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,987
I'm sorry. It's the last song
I heard this morning.

485
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,157
I hate when that happens.

486
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:35,088
I'm gonna put on some tunes.

487
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:38,258
- When did you get the CD player?
- When we got the money.

488
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,705
There it is. Excalibur.

489
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:14,753
'64 Fender Stratocaster with triple
single coil pickups and a whammy bar.

490
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:17,005
Pre-CBS Fender corporate buy-out.

491
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:20,592
I'd raise the bridge
and take the buzz out of the low E.

492
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,260
God, I love this woman.

493
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,764
- Hi, Garth.
- Hi.

494
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,936
Where's the clerk? I know.
I'll use the "may I help you" riff.

495
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:38,485
- May I help you?
- Yes, my good man.

496
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:40,820
I'd like see this
Fender Stratocaster.

497
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,656
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

498
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,199
- Again?
- Yes.

499
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:03,301
Be careful.

500
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,479
No Stairway. Denied!

501
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:04,321
- You're... amazing, dude.
- Thanks. I like to play.

502
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:13,246
Excuse me. Wayne?
Can I put the Fender back now, please?

503
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:16,166
Not today, my good man.
I'm feeling saucy.

504
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,794
I think I'm gonna buy it.
Do you accept cash?

505
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,265
Have you spoken to Wayne
about the Vanderhoff spot?

506
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:36,019
Yes. Briefly.
He was not very receptive.

507
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:40,732
Oh, really? Well, I'll explain
that it's in his contract.

508
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:46,196
Well, Wayne will understand
that right away. Not!

509
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,325
Excuse me.

510
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:54,371
I mean, there's two Darrin Stevens,
Dick York, Dick Sargent.

511
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:59,834
Sh'yeah! Right!
As if we wouldn't notice. Well, hold on.

512
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,255
Dick York, Dick Sargent,
Sergeant York. Wow, that's weird.

513
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:12,180
Wayne. Listen, we need
to have a talk about Vanderhoff.

514
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,973
The fact is, he's the sponsor.

515
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:17,143
You signed a contract
guaranteeing him concessions,

516
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:18,728
like a spot on the show.

517
00:48:18,854 --> 00:48:21,523
That's where I see things differently.

518
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:25,110
Contract or no,
I will not bow to any sponsor.

519
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:31,449
I'm sorry you feel that way,
but it's the nature of the beast.

520
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,867
Maybe I'm wrong on this one,

521
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:36,746
but for me, the beast
doesn't include selling out.

522
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:42,252
Garth, you know what I mean, right?

523
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:50,385
It's like people only do things
because they get paid,

524
00:48:50,511 --> 00:48:53,221
and that's just really sad.

525
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:57,183
I can't talk about it any more.
It's giving me a headache.

526
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,019
Here. Take two of these.

527
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:04,858
Ah, Nuprin.
Little. Yellow. Different.

528
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:09,696
Look, you can stay here in
the big leagues and play by the rules,

529
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,699
or go back to the farm club
in Aurora, your choice.

530
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:16,578
Yes. And it's the choice
of a new generation.

531
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,891
- Anything wrong, Davy?
- Yeah. I got paid today.

532
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:39,934
Yeah, I know what that's like.

533
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:43,980
No. You don't understand.
They laid me off.

534
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,233
- I got one of these.
- Yeah. I know how that feels.

535
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:51,154
- Know what I'd like to do?
- Yeah, I know what you'd like to do.

536
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:55,658
Find the guy that did it,
rip his still-beating heart out,

537
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:59,829
and hold it in his face so he can
see how black it is before he dies.

538
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:03,708
Actually, I was gonna
file a grievance with the union.

539
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:07,253
Well, the world's a twisted place.

540
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:13,843
- Hi.
- How's it going, Garth?

541
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,845
Good.

542
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:21,100
Hey. There she is.

543
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:33,029
I must've slipped.

544
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:38,451
Wayne, what do you do if every time
you see this one incredible woman,

545
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:39,953
you think you're gonna hurl?

546
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,707
I say hurl. If you blow chunks
and she comes back, she's yours.

547
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:50,129
If you spew and she bolts,
it was never meant to be.

548
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:55,051
I'm not ready yet.
I gotta be comfortable with me first.

549
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,512
Why don't you just go talk to her?

550
00:50:57,638 --> 00:51:00,640
Talk to her? Talk to her?

551
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:22,555
Camera one, camera two.
Camera one, camera two.

552
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,852
Don't.

553
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:35,234
Tell me,
when that first show is over,

554
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:39,322
will you still love me when
I'm an incredibly humongoid star?

555
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,740
Yeah.

556
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,409
And in my
hanging-out-with-Ravi-Shankar phase?

557
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,786
Yeah.

558
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:50,083
And in my sequin-jumpsuit,
young-girls-in-white-cotton-panties,

559
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,210
waking-up-in-a-pool-of-vomit,

560
00:52:52,336 --> 00:52:55,922
bloated-purple-dead-on-a-toilet phase?

561
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,133
- Yeah.
- OK. Party. Bonus.

562
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:05,098
- Yeah? Oh, hi, Anthony.
- Who's Anthony? Who's Anthony?

563
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:08,393
- My drummer.
- OK.

564
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,478
You what?

565
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:15,274
No, I told you next week
we'll be doing a music video.

566
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:20,071
Do you mind? This is business.

567
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,783
You wanna be a busboy
the rest of your life?

568
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:26,869
Well, then, talk to your boss.

569
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:34,919
Look, this guy Benjamin's putting up
serious money for this. Yeah.

570
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:38,214
Happy birthday

571
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:41,718
Mr President

572
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,220
Happy birthday

573
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,556
To you

574
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:55,189
Work it out, OK? Just...
No, just be there. OK, bye.

575
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,108
You asshole!

576
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,618
Excellent.

577
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:27,972
- All right. Glad you could make it.
- Yes!

578
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,267
- Cool.
- Yes.

579
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:35,897
This is definitely what I'm gonna get
when I move out of my parents' house.

580
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:39,192
- You have a terrace!
- Yeah. Go on out.

581
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,652
I'll get the Dom Perignon.

582
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:50,119
- What floor is this?
- Um... the 23rd.

583
00:54:56,126 --> 00:55:01,005
You know, Cassandra,
from this height...

584
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,884
you could really
hawk a lugie on someone.

585
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:13,726
- I feel so free up here!
- Costs a lot to live this free.

586
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,020
This might be a tangent,

587
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:19,065
but it's something
I've been thinking about...

588
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:24,195
Hi. If Cassandra was my girl,
I wouldn't bring her here.

589
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:29,367
I mean, look at this place.
This is a fully functional babe lair.

590
00:55:29,493 --> 00:55:32,203
Chicks are helpless
against its powers.

591
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,913
Let's check it out.

592
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:36,833
I don't believe
I've had French champagne.

593
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:40,336
Actually, all champagne is French,
after the region.

594
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:45,424
Otherwise, it's sparkling white wine.
Americans ignore the convention,

595
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:50,054
so they call their sparkling
whites champagne, though they're not.

596
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:53,599
Yes. It's a lot like
Star Trek: The Next Generation.

597
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:58,145
It's often superior, but will never
be as recognised as the original.

598
00:56:01,567 --> 00:56:04,193
What's this?
"How To Pick Up Chicks".

599
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,321
"How To Meet Women". He's smooth.

600
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:14,370
"Daily reminder... Thursday.

601
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:19,876
"Purchase feeble public access
cable show and exploit it. "

602
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:24,255
I feel sorry for whoever that is.
Let's look over here.

603
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,516
"Ribbed for her pleasure. "

604
00:56:37,436 --> 00:56:39,186
Well, the show looks great.

605
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:42,440
Mr Vanderhoff's excited.
I'm very excited.

606
00:56:42,566 --> 00:56:46,819
I think the show's gonna be
a huge hit all over the Chicago area.

607
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,821
For you and Garth -

608
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:51,657
tickets to Alice Cooper
tomorrow night in Milwaukee.

609
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:53,784
Backstage passes!

610
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:57,955
All-access backstage
with Alice Cooper?

611
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,750
- Thank you.
- Take the day off. Enjoy yourselves.

612
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:05,087
- What about Cassandra?
- She and I have work to do.

613
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:08,716
- Here's to your success.
- No. Here's to Benjamin.

614
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,018
Who wants Chinese takeout?
I know a great place.

615
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:22,939
I'll have the cream of sum yung guy.

616
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,652
Cassandra, why don't you order?

617
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,488
No. I'm sure whatever you order
will be fine.

618
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,198
OK.

619
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:53,344
This guy is good.

620
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,514
Picked up a little Cantonese
in the Orient.

621
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:59,684
You sound more like Kowloon Bay
than Hong Kong.

622
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:03,604
- I was born in Kowloon Bay.
- There you have it.

623
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,232
This guy's really good.

624
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,826
- Sounds great!
- Thanks.

625
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:02,621
- You got a minute?
- Sure. Hey, guys, hang out.

626
00:59:02,748 --> 00:59:05,791
I came by to drop off
the contract for the video.

627
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:09,920
Great. I never really got a chance
to say thank you.

628
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:13,591
- You've been very generous.
- It's been my pleasure.

629
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:17,261
Listen, if you're done, we could
spend the afternoon together.

630
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,060
We should be close
to Milwaukee by now.

631
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,946
- Look! There's Shotz brewery!
- Cool!

632
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:12,191
Wait a minute. What are we doin'?

633
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:15,528
Yeah! We got backstage passes
for Alice Cooper!

634
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:09,874
Do you want to go backstage?

635
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:15,588
Yeah. Let's go back now
and beat the crowd.

636
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:44,992
- Where you going?
- Got a pass.

637
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:58,297
Uh-oh. I think we took a wrong turn,
cos we're outside now.

638
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:00,424
Whoa! Look!

639
01:02:03,470 --> 01:02:05,262
Is this Alice's limo?

640
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,224
It belongs to Frank Sharp,
head of Sharp Records.

641
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,267
Good friend of Alice's.

642
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:14,521
Wow. That's, like, way bigger
than a normal size car.

643
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:18,025
Well, it has to be.
He drives everywhere.

644
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,986
Hates to fly. He's going across
the country right now

645
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,489
to look for new acts
to sign to his label.

646
01:02:23,657 --> 01:02:25,532
Next stop is St Louis.

647
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:30,704
Then he'll come back through Chicago
on his way to Detroit.

648
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,041
Thanks.

649
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:42,716
For a security guard, he had an awful
lot of information, don't you think?

650
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:47,972
Thank you, Milwaukee!

651
01:02:48,098 --> 01:02:52,768
Ladies, I'm sorry. No...
You got pass? All right. Come on.

652
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,655
- Let us through, please!
- Can't let you in.

653
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:12,705
- Alice. Is this cool?
- Yeah. Come on in.

654
01:03:12,831 --> 01:03:14,123
Sorry to bother you,

655
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:16,750
but we had to tell you
how much we enjoyed the show.

656
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,253
Didn't we, Garth?

657
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,172
Oh. Thanks.

658
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:25,342
We're not mental or anything,
so don't be afraid.

659
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:31,223
- My name is Wayne and this is Garth.
- Nice to meet you guys.

660
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:36,270
So do you come to Milwaukee often?

661
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:39,189
Well, I'm a regular visitor,

662
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:42,234
but Milwaukee has certainly
had its share of visitors.

663
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:46,030
French missionaries and explorers
came in the late 1600s

664
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,115
to trade with the Native Americans.

665
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,910
- Isn't Milwaukee an Indian name?
- Yes, Pete, it is.

666
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:54,330
Actually, it's pronounced
mee-lee-wah-kay,

667
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:59,293
- Algonquin for "the good land".
- I was not aware of that.

668
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:03,047
One of its most
interesting aspects is that

669
01:04:03,173 --> 01:04:07,551
it's the only major American city to
have elected three Socialist mayors.

670
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,346
Does this guy know how to party
or what?

671
01:04:13,725 --> 01:04:19,438
- OK. Well, we gotta get going.
- No, stick around. Hang out with us.

672
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:25,736
Cool. Yeah, we'll stay
and hang around with you...

673
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,988
with Alice Cooper.

674
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:33,369
We're not worthy! We're not worthy!

675
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:38,415
We're not worthy!
We're scum! We suck!

676
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:44,755
Our first big show
and we almost didn't make it.

677
01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:48,092
I really hope Cassandra's watching.

678
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:53,263
The couch works perfect. Hey.

679
01:04:53,390 --> 01:04:56,433
- How's it going?
- Tonight's the night.

680
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,895
A lot of people in the Chicagoland
area will be watching the show.

681
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:05,984
You know what? I know
it's gonna be a hit. I'll be in the booth.

682
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:10,072
- Mr Vanderhoff is your first guest.
- Hi, boys.

683
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:13,575
- What the hell is this?
- Can we fly in the sign, please?

684
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:17,246
That's it. Bring her down.

685
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:23,085
- Don't tense up. You'll be great.
- Garth, have you got a second?

686
01:05:23,211 --> 01:05:27,965
Simply read the cards.
You're going to be wonderful. Really.

687
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:34,638
Russell, can I borrow your marker?
I need to make some notes.

688
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:39,601
Sure. Good luck.

689
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:42,813
My guys. You're my guys!

690
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:54,158
- Your name is pronounced Algar?
- OK. Wayne!

691
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:03,250
- This is it, honey.
- In five, four, three...

692
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:11,258
Wayne's World is brought to you
by Noah's Arcade. Party on, Wayne.

693
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:23,061
It's Friday. It's 11:30.

694
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:26,482
It's time to party with
your excellent host Wayne Campbell,

695
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:29,359
and with him, as always, Garth.

696
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:32,362
Party on, Wayne, and party on, Garth.

697
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:38,118
OK. Welcome to Wayne's World.

698
01:06:38,286 --> 01:06:41,121
- Party on, Garth.
- I guess.

699
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:47,544
OK, first of all, we'd like to take
a moment to welcome our sponsor.

700
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:51,298
He's the owner of a fine chain
of Noah's Arcades...

701
01:06:51,424 --> 01:06:54,968
Noah Vanderhoff. Nice name... not!

702
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:58,722
Now, Mr Vanderhoff...

703
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,893
- He's using the cards. Yes!
- I told you he'd fall in line.

704
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:06,021
What is your most popular
video game right now?

705
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,815
Desert Storm Commando Warriors.

706
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,987
About that limited skirmish
in the Middle East?

707
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:17,574
- Yes.
- What the hell's he doing?

708
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,244
Aren't there long lines
for the popular games?

709
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:26,458
At Noah's Arcade, there's two of
everything, so there's never a line.

710
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:30,587
OK. Now, Noah,
I've always wanted to know...

711
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:34,424
.. what is the difference between
Pac-Man and Ms Pac-Man, really?

712
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,385
She has a bow on her head.

713
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:38,720
That's it?

714
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:44,560
- Get right out of town.
- No, that's it.

715
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:57,197
Thanks for being on Wayne's World.
It was informative and stimulating.

716
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,491
Now a word from our sponsor.

717
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:03,453
- We're at commercial.
- That was fun.

718
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:06,290
- I'll see you next week.
- I hope.

719
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:08,875
Wayne, come to the booth, please?

720
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:14,256
- Honey, you were incredible.
- I think it went really well.

721
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:18,468
Absolutely. There was a huge response
in that little room.

722
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:22,347
Those phrases were not on the cards
when I gave them to him.

723
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:26,602
Wayne. What the hell is going on?

724
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:29,521
- What are you doing?
- Same thing we always do.

725
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:32,024
You've publicly
humiliated the sponsor.

726
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:34,067
- Yeah.
- You're fired.

727
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:38,071
Fired? For that? Sh'yeah! Right!

728
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:40,991
I'm out of here,
and I'm taking my show with me.

729
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:44,036
- We own the show.
- Bite me.

730
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:52,169
- OK. Are we back?
- Stand by.

731
01:08:52,295 --> 01:08:54,796
- Coming back?
- And go.

732
01:08:54,922 --> 01:08:57,591
Five, four, three...

733
01:09:05,683 --> 01:09:09,686
I'm having a good time... not.

734
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:16,485
Ever see Scanners,
when that dude's head blew up?

735
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:27,579
- Hello?
- Hello. It's Benjamin.

736
01:09:27,705 --> 01:09:31,458
- Oh, hi.
- Did you see the show tonight?

737
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:36,046
I was working, so I only saw
the first part, but I laughed my ass off.

738
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:41,134
We had some technical difficulties
and we're playing with the format.

739
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,137
Has Wayne talked to you?

740
01:09:44,263 --> 01:09:47,182
About what?
Why? Are you cancelling my video?

741
01:09:47,308 --> 01:09:49,601
No, I called to make sure we're still on.

742
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:55,190
- Well, we got a deal, right?
- Absolutely. See you in Chicago.

743
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,734
OK. Bye.

744
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,908
You really pissed me off tonight.

745
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,869
Garth, you've never been mad
at anything in your life.

746
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:13,375
You shouldn't have walked out.
I handled it OK,

747
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:16,086
but you shouldn't walk out on
your friend without telling him first.

748
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,505
So I have to
run everything by you now?

749
01:10:18,631 --> 01:10:21,425
Yeah, you have to
run everything by me now.

750
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:25,178
What am I, a chimp?
"With you, as always, is Garth?"

751
01:10:25,304 --> 01:10:27,055
Jim to your Marlin Perkins?

752
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:32,185
Benjamin had you so snowed.
He's got it for Cassandra.

753
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,104
- No way.
- Way.

754
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:37,733
Sh'yeah! Cassandra's
not interested. As if.

755
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:42,696
OK, pop quiz. Cassandra is
not interested in Benjamin because

756
01:10:42,822 --> 01:10:47,075
A: chicks think he's handsome,
B: has cool car,

757
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:51,538
C: has lots of cash,
D: has no visible scars,

758
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:54,499
E: does not live with parents.

759
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:59,755
OK, how about F: you're a gimp.
Know what you can do with your quiz?

760
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:06,511
Know what you can do with your show?
You can take a flying...

761
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:15,479
.. until the handle breaks off

762
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:18,690
and you have to find a doctor
to pull it out again.

763
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,817
Kiss your mother with that mouth?

764
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:24,154
You've gone mental.
I'm getting out of here, Damien.

765
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,989
- Fine, then. Go.
- I'm gone.

766
01:11:26,157 --> 01:11:27,657
- Go, then.
- I am.

767
01:11:27,784 --> 01:11:29,117
- Go.
- I'm gone.

768
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:32,120
- Go, then.
- I am.

769
01:11:44,801 --> 01:11:49,012
Where you been? I waited up for you
last night, and you never showed.

770
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,890
- Where are you going?
- Chicago.

771
01:11:52,016 --> 01:11:55,352
Benjamin set up the video shoot
for three days.

772
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:58,104
I guess Benjamin will be there, too.

773
01:11:58,231 --> 01:12:00,857
He's producing it.
And what does that mean?

774
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:04,694
He's been paying you
a lot of attention lately.

775
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:07,531
Well, maybe he thinks
I've got some talent.

776
01:12:07,657 --> 01:12:12,035
- Maybe he's pokin' ya.
- What?

777
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,663
You think that's the way I get a gig?

778
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:18,959
Well, first he screws me, then you.
It's Dutch door action.

779
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:25,090
- Could you be any more insulting?
- Yeah.

780
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,469
I think you'd better leave.

781
01:12:31,264 --> 01:12:34,391
Fine. I'm outta here.

782
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:42,858
Oh, man.

783
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:46,695
What the hell's going on?

784
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:51,658
I lost my show,
I lost my best friend, I lost my girl.

785
01:12:51,784 --> 01:12:53,785
I'm being shit on,
that's all, shit on.

786
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:56,746
And do you know
what really pisses me off?

787
01:12:56,873 --> 01:13:01,418
Where are you going?
OK, OK, come on back. Come on back.

788
01:13:01,544 --> 01:13:04,337
Things aren't as bad as they seem.

789
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:06,423
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to dump on you.

790
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,718
I'll figure something out. OK?

791
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:17,726
Mr Donuthead,
who's trying to kill you?

792
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:19,477
I don't know but they better not.

793
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:25,483
If you stab a man in winter,
steam will rise up from the wounds.

794
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:31,406
That's not good!
I'm not happy! Oh, no!

795
01:13:31,532 --> 01:13:35,160
Indians believed it was his soul
escaping from his body.

796
01:13:35,286 --> 01:13:36,786
Right, Glen.

797
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,379
Hi.

798
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:55,889
- Hi.
- I'm sorry about what I did.

799
01:13:57,141 --> 01:14:01,519
- Buds?
- Buds.

800
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:07,692
Officer Koharski.

801
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:12,948
Damn shame how they screwed up
your show. Nice little programme.

802
01:14:13,074 --> 01:14:17,702
- Not that I ever watched it.
- Here you go.

803
01:14:17,828 --> 01:14:21,206
- So, how you doing?
- 'K, s'pose.

804
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:23,375
Just wish I had Cassandra back.

805
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:27,128
She's in Chicago
shooting a video with Benjamin.

806
01:14:27,254 --> 01:14:32,550
- So, what are you going to do?
- I don't know.

807
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:34,427
I do have one plan.

808
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,225
What are you gonna do
with these guys?

809
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,352
Oh, nothing, really.

810
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:47,857
I always wanted to open a door
to a room of people being trained,

811
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,235
like in James Bond movies.

812
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:52,779
- Wicked.
- Yeah.

813
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,954
I think you should
just go get Cassandra.

814
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,707
I just don't think she wants me to.

815
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:07,669
Let me tell you something
I've learned about women.

816
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,923
They want you to come get them.

817
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:18,555
They love it.

818
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:23,018
I wish there was something
I could offer that Benjamin couldn't.

819
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:27,689
- You'll think of something.
- Wait a minute!

820
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:30,692
No. Wait a minute!

821
01:15:32,445 --> 01:15:34,487
Wait a minute! I know!

822
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:38,324
The guy in the limo, Mr Big,
the guy who owns Sharp Records.

823
01:15:38,451 --> 01:15:41,619
If we could just get him to listen
to Cassandra play.

824
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:45,331
Halt. Halt.
Remember the security guard?

825
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:48,835
He said Mr Sharp was driving back
through Chicago on Friday.

826
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:51,421
That's right. Wow.

827
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:54,716
Aren't we lucky we were there
to get that information?

828
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:56,634
It seemed extraneous at the time.

829
01:15:56,761 --> 01:16:00,805
OK, first I'll access
the secret military spy satellite

830
01:16:01,015 --> 01:16:03,349
in its geosynchronous orbit
over the Midwest.

831
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:07,812
Then I'll ID the limo
by the vanity plate "MR BIGGG".

832
01:16:08,981 --> 01:16:11,983
Then I'll reposition
the transmitter dish in the truck

833
01:16:12,151 --> 01:16:16,071
to 17.32 degrees east,
hit Westar 4 over the Atlantic,

834
01:16:16,197 --> 01:16:18,865
bounce the signal down
into the Azores, up to Comsat 6,

835
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:22,118
beam it back to Satcom 3
transponder 137,

836
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:27,999
and down to the dish of Mr Big's limo.
It's almost too easy.

837
01:16:29,627 --> 01:16:34,464
We can only pray he's watching TV
in his limo at that exact moment.

838
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,884
- We'll need help.
- We'll help!

839
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,761
You get Cassandra! We'll do the rest!

840
01:16:40,554 --> 01:16:42,972
To the mirthmobile!

841
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:56,986
- OK, this is a take, everybody.
- I think the snake fell asleep!

842
01:17:00,658 --> 01:17:02,617
Playback!

843
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:10,792
Looking good!

844
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:51,207
- This snake weighs a ton.
- It looks great on you.

845
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,878
- I'm coming down now.
- I'm telling you, you're hot!

846
01:18:30,915 --> 01:18:35,543
- Yes, officer? Is something wrong?
- Have you seen this boy?

847
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:51,476
You know, you're exactly right.
Why leave the hotel?

848
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:56,648
We'll have dinner sent up,
you can have a hot bath.

849
01:18:58,192 --> 01:19:01,319
- We have to talk.
- I don't want to talk to you.

850
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:03,613
I've set up an audition for your band.

851
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:06,366
My show is back.
You've got to be on it.

852
01:19:06,492 --> 01:19:09,619
- Wayne, go home.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

853
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:14,165
Cassandra, I love you.
You may not believe it, but I love you.

854
01:19:14,291 --> 01:19:18,419
Am I supposed to just
turn my back and leave?

855
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:21,089
Am I supposed to be a man?

856
01:19:21,215 --> 01:19:25,635
Am I supposed to say,
"That's OK, I don't mind.

857
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:30,723
"I don't mind. "
Well, I mind! I mind big time!

858
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:35,019
And you know what
the worst part of all is?

859
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:39,274
I never learned to read.

860
01:19:41,485 --> 01:19:45,154
- Is that true?
- Everything except the reading part.

861
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,449
Nice speech but we're busy.

862
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:53,663
Of course.
Her music video. Very clever.

863
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:57,417
- But where is her band?
- Hi, Wayne.

864
01:19:57,543 --> 01:20:00,420
Hi, guys. I didn't see you there.

865
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:04,549
Well, I guess you've thought
of everything, huh?

866
01:20:04,675 --> 01:20:07,427
Nothing left for me to do
but just go home.

867
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,013
Bye-bye, Wayne. It's bedtime.

868
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:16,436
But both you and I know
that there is no film in this camera.

869
01:20:25,154 --> 01:20:28,990
Wayne, go home!

870
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:41,002
Sometimes people outgrow one another.

871
01:20:41,128 --> 01:20:44,130
It's very sad,
but you can't let it drag you down.

872
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:47,383
Is that you, or the snake?

873
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:52,889
Campbell, wait up!

874
01:20:53,015 --> 01:20:57,268
Cassandra, I know I don't have
his looks, I don't have his money,

875
01:20:57,394 --> 01:21:00,938
I don't have his connections,
his knowledge of fine wines,

876
01:21:01,065 --> 01:21:04,067
when I eat I get
this clicking in myjaw...

877
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:08,613
- Shut your yap and get in the car.
- Excellent.

878
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:25,880
That's right, girl. Mr Big's limo
is right where we want it.

879
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:36,641
Gentlemen, this is it. Let's go.
Down now!

880
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:48,820
Wait up, guys. I fell on my keys.

881
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:13,010
- Freeze!
- Oh, hi, Russell. How's it going?

882
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:16,889
- Hold it right there!
- Watch where you're pointing that.

883
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:22,061
Give me the flashlight, Russell.
Give it to me.

884
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:25,982
- You can help us, Russell.
- No! I'm supposed to stop you.

885
01:22:26,108 --> 01:22:27,650
What are you gonna do?

886
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:30,820
You gonna be Benjamin's monkey boy
all your life?

887
01:22:30,988 --> 01:22:33,656
- Benjamin's my friend.
- No.

888
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,492
Benjamin is no one's friend.

889
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:40,955
If Benjamin were
an ice cream flavour,

890
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:44,250
he'd be pralines and dick.

891
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,254
It's OK!

892
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:53,634
He's gonna be OK.

893
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:59,223
- Hi.
- Hi. How's it going?

894
01:23:08,567 --> 01:23:11,444
- I love you, man.
- I know.

895
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:18,284
No, you don't. I love you, man.

896
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:23,956
- I know.
- Just say thank you.

897
01:23:30,088 --> 01:23:32,673
Thank you. All right.

898
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:36,928
I understand you're doing your job,
but I'm very late.

899
01:23:37,054 --> 01:23:40,389
Would you mind placing your hands
on the hood, son?

900
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:44,393
There's just one other thing
I've got to check.

901
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:03,287
OK, this is a special
Wayne's World, OK?

902
01:24:03,413 --> 01:24:08,125
It's for an audience of one.
Mr Frankie Sharp of Sharp Records,

903
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:10,753
if you like what you see,

904
01:24:10,921 --> 01:24:14,423
we're at 2234 Pine Way
in Aurora, Illinois.

905
01:24:14,591 --> 01:24:16,300
So, ladies and gentlemen,

906
01:24:16,426 --> 01:24:21,430
I give you Cassandra
and Crucial Taunt!

907
01:26:53,125 --> 01:26:57,253
Hi. I'm Frankie Sharp.
I saw your performance in my limo.

908
01:26:57,379 --> 01:27:00,756
I've seen a lot of acts in my day,

909
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:04,719
and although you're very beautiful,
I just think it's the wrong time.

910
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:10,433
- I'm sorry.
- You screwed my career!

911
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:14,270
I always knew you were small-time.

912
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:20,151
Wayne, I'm pregnant.
That's why I've been so moody.

913
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:27,950
Whoa! Look! Fire!
Let's get out of here!

914
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:48,053
Why, God? Why?

915
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:59,565
Last night was the most
incredible night of my life.

916
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:02,735
You were terrific.

917
01:28:12,245 --> 01:28:13,746
You didn't think
she'd end up with Wayne?

918
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:17,666
As if.

919
01:28:17,793 --> 01:28:20,503
As if we'd end the movie like that.
Sh'yeah!

920
01:28:20,629 --> 01:28:24,423
- Let's do the Scooby-Doo ending!
- Good call.

921
01:28:41,733 --> 01:28:46,153
Hi. Frankie Sharp.
I saw your performance in my limo.

922
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:50,699
We got through! That wraps it up,
but there's one last thing.

923
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:54,119
Let's just see who
you really are, mister.

924
01:28:55,413 --> 01:28:58,207
Old man Withers
from the haunted amusement park!

925
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:02,086
I woulda got away with it, too,
if not for you snooping kids!

926
01:29:02,212 --> 01:29:06,090
- Good one, Shaggy.
- Excellent Scooby-Doo ending.

927
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:10,219
- Let's do the megahappy ending.
- That's doable.

928
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:34,243
Hi. I'm Frankie Sharp.
I saw your performance in my limo.

929
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:36,537
I must tell you, it was terrific.

930
01:29:36,663 --> 01:29:42,543
In fact, I think it's so good,
I'm gonna give you a six-album deal.

931
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:43,919
See you in my office.

932
01:29:45,130 --> 01:29:48,257
- I love you, Wayne.
- I love you, Cassandra.

933
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:56,181
- I love you, Garth.
- I love you, dreamwoman.

934
01:29:57,350 --> 01:30:01,186
Ever since I did your show,
kids look at me in a whole new way.

935
01:30:02,188 --> 01:30:04,607
- I love you, man.
- And I love you.

936
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:10,821
Because I've learned that platonic love
can exist between two grown men.

937
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:12,865
And I've learned something, too.

938
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:16,660
I've learned that
a flawless profile, a perfect body,

939
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,412
the right clothes and a great car,

940
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:21,457
can get you far in America,
almost to the top,

941
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:23,584
but it can't get you everything.

942
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:29,214
Isn't it great
that we're all better people?

943
01:30:29,341 --> 01:30:32,968
Fished in! Fished in!

944
01:31:23,353 --> 01:31:26,355
- Excellent movie. All right.
- Good one.

945
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:29,650
Well, that's all the time
for our movie.

946
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:33,904
We hope you found it entertaining,
whimsical yet relevant,

947
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,864
with an underlying revisionist conceit

948
01:31:35,991 --> 01:31:39,785
that belied its emotional attachments
to the subject matter.

949
01:31:40,787 --> 01:31:44,248
I just hope you didn't think it sucked.

950
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:47,251
OK. Thank you for coming.
Good night and party on.

951
01:31:47,377 --> 01:31:49,837
- Party on, Wayne.
- Party on, Garth.

952
01:33:56,589 --> 01:34:01,051
You know, I don't think anyone's
gonna tell us when to leave.

953
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:05,055
Yeah. Good call, Garth.
I'll bet we're just gonna sit here,

954
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:08,517
and when they're finished,
they'll fade to black.

955
01:34:13,022 --> 01:34:16,066
- I can't believe they did that.
- I told ya.

956
01:34:16,651 --> 01:34:17,276

1
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,591
Good luck, General Yin.

2
00:03:08,824 --> 00:03:11,382
A man must do or die.

3
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:14,357
Mr. Ho, before I left,

4
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:15,754
Lord Cheng is concerned about you.

5
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,553
If he can strike back with his army,

6
00:03:18,591 --> 00:03:20,920
And defeat the tartars.

7
00:03:20,957 --> 00:03:25,322
Credit for Canton will be yours.

8
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:29,687
One must sacrifice for one's country.

9
00:03:29,724 --> 00:03:33,384
The brothers arrested by tartars...

10
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:37,585
Were tortured but have so far...

11
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:39,613
Refused to make a confession.

12
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:41,487
This is most admirable.

13
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:44,848
If I fail...

14
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:47,050
I wouldn't even get arrested.

15
00:03:47,091 --> 00:03:48,318
General Yin.

16
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:50,789
Mr. Ho, please.

17
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,484
North Door

18
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:25,255
Sirs.

19
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:30,451
When inspector-gen.
And Gen. Tien Ta...

20
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:36,446
arrive, please say a good word for me.

21
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:40,321
Don't worry, Mr. Magistrate.

22
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:43,517
General Tien Ta ordered us.

23
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:45,819
To capture the traitors.

24
00:04:45,857 --> 00:04:49,051
The inspector

25
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:52,887
Will supervise the execution.

26
00:04:52,924 --> 00:04:54,185
Yes, yes...

27
00:04:54,224 --> 00:04:57,553
Tang San-yao, it's almost 12:30.

28
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,613
- Don't forget the General's command.
- Yes.

29
00:05:00,657 --> 00:05:04,953
The inspector-general is here.

30
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:05,979
Make way...

31
00:05:06,024 --> 00:05:08,717
Make way...

32
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,786
We're trapped!

33
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:11,121
General Yin, I knew you'd be here.

34
00:06:11,158 --> 00:06:12,783
To "welcome" the inspector-general.

35
00:06:18,158 --> 00:06:22,318
But he has not yet reached Canton!

36
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:43,947
Stop.

37
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:48,214
Your skill is comparable to a general.

38
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:51,519
Let's have a fair fight:

39
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:54,421
A General to a General.

40
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:58,117
Let me try you out.

41
00:06:58,158 --> 00:07:02,590
Good, I need a substitute.

42
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,381
Let me fight you single-handedly.

43
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,282
Quiet down.

44
00:09:01,323 --> 00:09:03,017
The teacher's here.

45
00:09:03,058 --> 00:09:06,751
The teacher's here, hurry up...

46
00:09:10,323 --> 00:09:11,721
Mr. Ho.

47
00:09:16,123 --> 00:09:17,282
Mr. Ho.

48
00:09:37,957 --> 00:09:43,651
What's it?
What's happened to Mr. Ho?

49
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,613
Mr. Ho.

50
00:10:01,023 --> 00:10:02,319
Please have some tea, Mr. Ho.

51
00:10:11,023 --> 00:10:14,046
Mr. Ho, why are you so late?

52
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,556
Did you watch the execution?

53
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,647
Leave me alone!

54
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:21,156
Isn't it enjoyable to watch executions?

55
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:26,122
Lin Zhen, it depends on who it is.

56
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:30,317
If it is the tartars who invaded us...

57
00:10:30,357 --> 00:10:31,913
Of course it is gratifying.

58
00:10:31,956 --> 00:10:38,446
But today's convicts are patriots,

59
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,547
They are all Han's martyrs.

60
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,919
Do you still think it is enjoyable?

61
00:10:43,956 --> 00:10:46,047
I...

62
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:51,514
Yesterday, I taught you sacrifice.

63
00:10:51,557 --> 00:10:54,045
For the sake of a righteous cause.

64
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:58,386
Do you all understand?

65
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,014
Yes.

66
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:04,650
Hurry up...

67
00:11:09,923 --> 00:11:11,082
It's here.

68
00:11:28,157 --> 00:11:29,850
Is he dead or alive?

69
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:33,879
He's so stiff, of course he's dead.

70
00:11:37,657 --> 00:11:39,680
He's a hero.

71
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,181
What did you say?

72
00:11:43,223 --> 00:11:44,984
I...

73
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,353
- Arrest him.
- Yes.

74
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,981
You're an accomplice.

75
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:52,853
Lord Tang... Listen to me.

76
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,152
This student is not a bad man.

77
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:57,849
He's the son of a seafood shop owner.

78
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:03,585
- Son of a shop owner?
- Yes, exactly.

79
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:07,078
These are his classmates.

80
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:09,021
Yes, we're his classmates.

81
00:12:09,057 --> 00:12:10,852
Where are you studying?

82
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:15,845
They all study in Chong Wen College.

83
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,788
Are you vouching for them, Mr. Wang?

84
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:24,017
Yes. Apologize to Lord Tang.

85
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:26,455
I...

86
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,217
You're young and ignorant.

87
00:12:28,257 --> 00:12:29,245
Always causing trouble.

88
00:12:34,357 --> 00:12:37,551
Do you know who I am?

89
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:41,613
I do. Tang San-yao, Lord Tang.

90
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,422
Yes, let's go, quickly!

91
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:52,287
Uncle Wang,
we didn't do anything wrong.

92
00:12:52,323 --> 00:12:55,720
Yes, I know.
Tang San-yao's notorious…

93
00:12:55,756 --> 00:12:58,086
for his craze after money and women.

94
00:12:58,123 --> 00:13:01,782
You mustn't antagonize him.

95
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,449
As the saying goes, "One must..."

96
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:08,388
humble oneself under enemy's rule."

97
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:24,855
Mr. Ho... please open the door!

98
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:26,288
Who is it?

99
00:13:26,323 --> 00:13:27,482
Mr. Ho.

100
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:32,283
Open the door, Mr. Ho.

101
00:13:32,323 --> 00:13:33,346
Mr. Ho.

102
00:13:38,956 --> 00:13:40,149
Mr. Ho! …

103
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,716
What's wrong?

104
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:46,779
I...

105
00:13:46,823 --> 00:13:49,381
There's something we don't understand.

106
00:13:49,424 --> 00:13:51,651
So we've come here even at this hour.

107
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:55,020
Humble oneself under enemy's rule.

108
00:13:55,057 --> 00:13:57,216
Do we and our children have to...

109
00:13:57,257 --> 00:13:59,882
Humble ourselves forever?

110
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:07,420
I'd say, we'd be beheaded if we didn't.

111
00:14:07,457 --> 00:14:09,979
If we fear not death we don't have to.

112
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:13,353
You're right. It's well said.

113
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,822
One brave man alone is not enough.

114
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:21,845
But unity is strength.

115
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,913
The tartars are well-armed.

116
00:14:24,956 --> 00:14:26,115
We...

117
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:30,646
Man owes allegiance to his country.

118
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:35,748
Lord Cheng is recruiting in Taiwan.

119
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,756
He's become tartar's biggest concern.

120
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:42,245
The Manchurian emperor has ordered...

121
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:44,188
Coastal residents to move away.

122
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:47,985
And to be on their guard.

123
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:49,387
Mr. Ho.

124
00:14:49,424 --> 00:14:51,685
I wish Lord Cheng could use us.

125
00:14:51,723 --> 00:14:53,746
The day will come.

126
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,915
Don't you all want to help?

127
00:14:56,956 --> 00:14:58,649
Yes.

128
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:01,815
- Good. Come here.
- Yes.

129
00:15:07,623 --> 00:15:11,386
Secret documents will arrive by sea.

130
00:15:11,424 --> 00:15:14,719
I need a way to bypass customs.

131
00:15:14,756 --> 00:15:16,619
Liu Yu-de

132
00:15:16,656 --> 00:15:19,122
- Doesn't your pa run a seafood shop?
- Yes.

133
00:15:32,323 --> 00:15:33,754
Open sesame...

134
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:36,620
Shut sesame...

135
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:42,685
Mr. Ho sent us here.

136
00:15:42,723 --> 00:15:43,950
Good.

137
00:15:50,589 --> 00:15:52,748
Little brother, you're a brave fellow.

138
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,955
Lock it up...

139
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:05,512
Yes, hurry...

140
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:08,022
Pa, has San Li's abalone arrived?

141
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:11,251
The abalone... Go, go now!

142
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:12,846
It has... The sea cucumber has too...

143
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:30,012
Te, what are you doing?

144
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:32,955
A big order for abalone was placed.

145
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:35,047
I am showing them some samples.

146
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,647
So you're in business now?

147
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:47,611
Te, you can't take the whole case.

148
00:16:47,656 --> 00:16:48,781
I'm in a hurry to deliver it.

149
00:16:48,823 --> 00:16:51,618
Hurry? Do you know
the market price?

150
00:16:51,656 --> 00:16:56,214
The quality's high.
Raise the price.

151
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:57,654
Open it

152
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:59,553
Yes.

153
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,017
Excellent kung fu.

154
00:17:07,057 --> 00:17:11,114
You'll find that at Shaolin Temple.

155
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,179
Mr. Ho, we could invite them to...

156
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:17,518
Yes.

157
00:17:17,556 --> 00:17:23,614
They don't involve in worldly matters.

158
00:17:23,656 --> 00:17:27,054
If Shaolin taught kung fu to laymen.

159
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,954
People could fight the tartars.

160
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,183
That would be great!

161
00:17:50,123 --> 00:17:51,952
Yue Shan, South gate...

162
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:57,279
Here.

163
00:17:57,556 --> 00:18:01,181
General Tien.

164
00:18:01,222 --> 00:18:02,984
Arise.

165
00:18:03,023 --> 00:18:05,080
Come over here.

166
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:16,086
Lately, we've suppressed rebels.

167
00:18:16,123 --> 00:18:18,554
And found this on their leaders

168
00:18:18,589 --> 00:18:23,045
Zheng Cheng-gong's edict.

169
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:25,949
Look, what have you been doing?

170
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,082
There must be many of Cheng's men

171
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:33,987
Hiding in Canton.

172
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:41,418
We must capture the rebels.

173
00:18:41,456 --> 00:18:46,718
And kill them to scare them off…

174
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:10,085
Who's that?

175
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:14,851
No idea. He's secretive, maybe a spy.

176
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:17,048
I'm innocent. I'm a delivery boy.

177
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,555
I've brought dried fish. Look!

178
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:20,384
Shut up.

179
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:45,981
Lord Zheng, notorious rebels...

180
00:19:46,022 --> 00:19:49,978
Who told you to bring this here?

181
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,148
No... no use to ask me.

182
00:19:58,856 --> 00:20:01,879
Kid, we'll take you away.

183
00:20:01,923 --> 00:20:09,915
And torture you one after another.

184
00:20:10,423 --> 00:20:13,355
And torture you one after another.

185
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:14,912
See how long you will hold your silence.

186
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:23,117
I'll talk... Don't torture me.

187
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:28,918
I...I say,

188
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:36,354
there is someone.

189
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:55,447
Go on with the torture...

190
00:20:55,489 --> 00:20:57,819
if you like!

191
00:21:13,889 --> 00:21:16,855
I saw a squadron of Ching troops...

192
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:19,355
Of over patrolling our alley.

193
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:21,753
Mr. Ho, what shall we do?

194
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:27,416
We must keep calm and
be on the alert.

195
00:21:27,456 --> 00:21:32,286
Yien-pin, let them hide in your home.

196
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:34,686
Mr. Ho, what about you...

197
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:39,379
Mr. Ho, Mr. Ho.

198
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,820
- Go quickly, go!
- What about you?

199
00:21:40,855 --> 00:21:42,082
Hurry up, quick.

200
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:07,252
Master, look!

201
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:11,221
Please have mercy...
please talk to them.

202
00:22:11,256 --> 00:22:14,245
Please ask them not to...

203
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,414
Quiet!

204
00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:20,916
General's order: No dried fish.

205
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:22,818
Then...

206
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:24,651
What's your relationship with Liu Yu-de.

207
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,213
He... he's my son.

208
00:22:28,256 --> 00:22:29,586
Bring him here.

209
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:33,987
He's not home...
What do you want him for?

210
00:22:34,022 --> 00:22:36,682
We've uncovered many spies recently.

211
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:42,882
One's a teacher; another's his pupil.

212
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,185
Liu Yu-de's a pupil of that school.

213
00:22:47,222 --> 00:22:50,154
We'll capture him and torture him!

214
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:54,212
Master, our young master won't...

215
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:55,620
Please have mercy.

216
00:22:55,656 --> 00:22:57,917
How do you know he wouldn't?

217
00:22:57,955 --> 00:23:00,251
Let's talk it over.

218
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:07,213
Pa...

219
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:09,313
Yu-de, run quickly... Yu-de

220
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:11,821
Young Master, run, run quickly…

221
00:23:11,855 --> 00:23:14,650
Run quickly, Young Master.

222
00:23:14,689 --> 00:23:15,814
You want to rebel?

223
00:23:15,855 --> 00:23:19,787
Yu-de, run quickly, run!

224
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:49,918
He's innocent! My son!

225
00:23:49,955 --> 00:23:52,421
Liu Yu-de, come up quickly.

226
00:23:52,456 --> 00:23:55,513
My son is innocent, my son!

227
00:24:07,122 --> 00:24:08,315
Change your clothes at once.

228
00:24:08,356 --> 00:24:09,685
I...

229
00:24:09,722 --> 00:24:11,585
All wearing school uniform will be
arrested.

230
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:14,111
Wonder what's happened to my home?

231
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:15,417
Try to find a hiding place first.

232
00:24:15,456 --> 00:24:17,183
We can find out later.

233
00:24:17,222 --> 00:24:18,551
Right, let's go now.

234
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,214
What has happened to my home?

235
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:29,813
Your home...

236
00:24:29,855 --> 00:24:31,650
Tell me...

237
00:24:31,689 --> 00:24:35,053
All the houses in the neighboring street...

238
00:24:35,089 --> 00:24:37,680
To your home have been cordoned off.

239
00:24:37,722 --> 00:24:39,211
What about my father?

240
00:25:00,722 --> 00:25:02,620
Pa...

241
00:25:02,655 --> 00:25:08,485
Don't be sad. It's the same for mine.

242
00:25:12,822 --> 00:25:14,379
I wish I had learnt kung fu.

243
00:25:14,423 --> 00:25:16,513
Instead of studying,

244
00:25:16,555 --> 00:25:21,011
So I could fight them.

245
00:25:21,056 --> 00:25:25,148
Studies teach us right from wrong.

246
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:27,654
What's the use of that?

247
00:25:27,689 --> 00:25:30,247
We can't talk sense with the tartars.

248
00:25:37,588 --> 00:25:39,986
We can't stay in this town anymore.

249
00:25:40,022 --> 00:25:42,783
The martial arts headquarters is...

250
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:44,481
Shaolin Temple.

251
00:25:51,056 --> 00:25:52,352
We're lucky we made it.

252
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:55,352
Let's go straight on.

253
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:07,212
Did you see a group of men riding by?

254
00:26:07,256 --> 00:26:11,449
Why don't you answer me?

255
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:15,648
Let's go!

256
00:26:31,422 --> 00:26:32,547
Dismount and chase them.

257
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:33,713
Yes.

258
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:36,312
These two must be traitors.

259
00:26:36,355 --> 00:26:39,288
One watch the horses, others chase.

260
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:40,480
Yes.

261
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:51,148
Hurry up.

262
00:27:03,056 --> 00:27:04,249
Let's go.

263
00:27:24,889 --> 00:27:26,320
Liu Yu-de, mount it.

264
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:27,844
Liu Yu-de?

265
00:27:27,889 --> 00:27:32,117
Liu Yu-de, escape now. Go!

266
00:27:32,156 --> 00:27:34,644
Don't let him get away.

267
00:27:49,689 --> 00:27:52,246
Liu Yu-de, good luck!

268
00:29:53,321 --> 00:29:56,378
Please give me some water.

269
00:30:20,121 --> 00:30:22,019
Thank you, uncle.

270
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:26,351
How far is it to Shaolin Temple?

271
00:30:26,388 --> 00:30:29,945
It's not far, only up the mountain.

272
00:30:29,988 --> 00:30:34,114
But it looks like you wouldn't make it.

273
00:30:34,155 --> 00:30:38,315
I can... even if I have to crawl there!

274
00:30:43,321 --> 00:30:50,152
Sit down. I don't think you can.

275
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:58,954
A few Shaolin monks buy
food here everyday.

276
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:02,352
Their cart is over there.

277
00:31:12,221 --> 00:31:15,381
Hurry up...
Do it orderly and quickly.

278
00:31:18,455 --> 00:31:19,977
Get going, go!

279
00:31:20,021 --> 00:31:24,420
- Why is it so heavy?
- Yes, I don't know why.

280
00:31:24,455 --> 00:31:27,080
Go. You'll be punished if you're late.

281
00:31:27,121 --> 00:31:29,019
Let's go, quick!

282
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:34,311
Push harder, harder, go!

283
00:31:49,155 --> 00:31:52,713
Hurry up, park the cart there.

284
00:31:52,755 --> 00:31:55,380
Come and lend a hand, everybody.

285
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:58,252
Why are you standing there, come here.

286
00:31:58,288 --> 00:32:01,220
Take this to the kitchen. Be quick.

287
00:32:12,754 --> 00:32:14,152
Why are you so slow? Hurry up...

288
00:32:15,722 --> 00:32:17,983
- Hurry up.
- Yes.

289
00:32:32,888 --> 00:32:35,116
What's the matter?

290
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:36,212
What's that man doing there?

291
00:32:40,655 --> 00:32:42,813
Stay calm, he can still be saved.

292
00:32:42,854 --> 00:32:44,945
Bring him inside. I'll tell the abbot.

293
00:33:55,522 --> 00:33:58,113
Sir, the abbot would like to see you.

294
00:33:58,155 --> 00:33:59,485
Thank you.

295
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:02,249
This temple is not a sanctuary.

296
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:04,254
You're spiteful and emotional.

297
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:09,811
Unfit to stay in the temple.

298
00:34:09,854 --> 00:34:13,616
You're recovering, please leave soon.

299
00:34:19,954 --> 00:34:22,512
I had so much difficulty coming here.

300
00:34:22,554 --> 00:34:24,111
I won't leave.

301
00:34:24,155 --> 00:34:26,780
Don't be rude.

302
00:34:26,821 --> 00:34:33,652
Splendid. We believe in fate...

303
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:37,882
And we believe fate has
brought you here.

304
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:42,751
Brother, you mustn't make a precedence.

305
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:48,618
He arrived here in a coma.

306
00:34:48,654 --> 00:34:50,916
But woke up after days.

307
00:34:50,954 --> 00:34:53,920
Perseverance to Buddhism.

308
00:34:53,954 --> 00:34:56,182
Warrants his admittance.

309
00:34:56,221 --> 00:35:00,846
Dharma also came to the east

310
00:35:00,888 --> 00:35:04,684
With such perseverance.

311
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:10,120
And laid the foundation of Shaolin.

312
00:35:10,155 --> 00:35:17,451
What are your opinions, brothers?

313
00:35:17,487 --> 00:35:20,715
You're right, brother.

314
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,117
Thank you abbot.

315
00:36:11,821 --> 00:36:12,844
Morning, sir.

316
00:36:17,354 --> 00:36:18,581
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

317
00:36:21,155 --> 00:36:22,143
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

318
00:36:33,387 --> 00:36:35,945
San Ta, San Ta.

319
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:38,079
Morning, sir.

320
00:36:38,121 --> 00:36:42,678
How long have you been here?

321
00:36:42,721 --> 00:36:45,119
Over a year.

322
00:36:45,155 --> 00:36:48,643
Are you unable to endure destitution?

323
00:36:48,688 --> 00:36:51,916
No, not that, but...

324
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,878
Don't hide anything from the Buddha.

325
00:36:57,921 --> 00:37:03,854
Before I came here, I heard

326
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,547
Shaolin's the headquarters of kung fu.

327
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:09,781
But for the past year,
I have only cleaned.

328
00:37:09,821 --> 00:37:12,309
I haven't seen any kung fu.

329
00:37:12,354 --> 00:37:16,048
You can learn kung fu if you want to.

330
00:37:16,088 --> 00:37:18,952
As long as they want to, any monk...

331
00:37:18,988 --> 00:37:22,886
Can learn from the chambers.

332
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:26,944
If you don't tell us who would know?

333
00:37:26,988 --> 00:37:31,852
Why do you want to learn kung fu?

334
00:37:31,888 --> 00:37:34,285
Honestly, sir.

335
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,775
Before I came here, I saw the people

336
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:40,252
Oppressed by tyrannical rule.

337
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:44,276
If they were able to learn kung fu.

338
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,980
They could defend themselves.

339
00:37:47,021 --> 00:37:48,850
And combat enemies. Therefore...

340
00:37:50,888 --> 00:37:52,547
Good, good.

341
00:37:54,921 --> 00:37:56,819
San Ta.

342
00:37:56,854 --> 00:38:02,184
Buddhists shouldn't bear such thought.

343
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,448
Don't mention it again!

344
00:38:05,487 --> 00:38:07,851
I won't abandon such a desire.

345
00:38:07,888 --> 00:38:11,183
Whatever the outcome,
I won't dare complain.

346
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,709
Sir.

347
00:38:13,754 --> 00:38:17,709
Can I still learn kung fu?

348
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,242
There're chambers in Shaolin.

349
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:21,617
Which chamber do you want to
start with?

350
00:38:21,654 --> 00:38:26,245
Which is the most advanced?

351
00:38:26,287 --> 00:38:27,981
The top chamber, of course!

352
00:38:28,021 --> 00:38:30,248
Then I'll start from the top.

353
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,445
Top Chamber

354
00:39:24,854 --> 00:39:26,410
Sir.

355
00:39:26,454 --> 00:39:27,818
Behold, the Buddha says,

356
00:39:27,854 --> 00:39:31,217
Emptiness is the Eternal Five.

357
00:39:31,254 --> 00:39:33,550
No sight, sound, smell, taste, sense.

358
00:39:34,554 --> 00:39:37,213
The five flavours dull the taste.

359
00:39:37,254 --> 00:39:42,778
The five tones deafen the ear.

360
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:47,685
The five colours blind the eye.

361
00:39:47,721 --> 00:39:51,244
It can also not be seen.

362
00:39:51,287 --> 00:39:54,447
But it won't pass away.

363
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:56,385
Being at one is eternal.

364
00:39:56,421 --> 00:40:02,217
But all things will come to you.

365
00:40:02,254 --> 00:40:05,550
Without wisdom... without...

366
00:40:05,587 --> 00:40:09,144
Leave!

367
00:40:09,187 --> 00:40:13,677
No wisdom, no gain.

368
00:40:13,721 --> 00:40:16,118
Gaining is not continuant.

369
00:40:16,154 --> 00:40:22,314
All men will come to me one?

370
00:40:22,354 --> 00:40:24,911
For there lies rest

371
00:40:24,953 --> 00:40:27,886
And happiness and peace

372
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,853
It's invisible and inaudible

373
00:40:29,888 --> 00:40:31,877
And it's inexhaustible.

374
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,148
Can you hear the sound of bells?

375
00:40:34,187 --> 00:40:39,848
The heart is calm. We hear nothing.

376
00:40:47,754 --> 00:40:52,186
How often do you recite the sutras?

377
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,152
I...I...

378
00:40:55,187 --> 00:40:58,051
Go away!

379
00:40:58,087 --> 00:41:00,144
Sir, I came to learn martial arts.

380
00:41:00,187 --> 00:41:03,119
Get out!

381
00:41:10,688 --> 00:41:13,745
No one learns martial arts here.

382
00:41:13,788 --> 00:41:18,186
This is the most advanced field.

383
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,083
You won't understand it.

384
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:24,644
I'm willing to start from the bottom.

385
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,912
Dining Room for 35th Chamber

386
00:42:09,087 --> 00:42:13,019
Cross the pond to enter dining hall.

387
00:42:13,054 --> 00:42:14,315
Yes.

388
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:23,350
Brother, this is the 35th chamber?

389
00:42:23,387 --> 00:42:26,114
Shut up. You starve if you're late.

390
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:59,486
A pure body is light, steps stable,
stance is firm.

391
00:42:59,521 --> 00:43:03,317
Don't enter the hall if you're dirty.

392
00:44:39,586 --> 00:44:42,109
How dare you enter this dining hall?

393
00:44:42,154 --> 00:44:44,382
Sir, I want to...

394
00:44:44,421 --> 00:44:45,387
Have congee?

395
00:44:51,486 --> 00:44:52,850
Come with me.

396
00:45:10,387 --> 00:45:11,579
Stand on the wood.

397
00:45:13,620 --> 00:45:15,018
Jump.

398
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,515
Turn around!

399
00:45:24,553 --> 00:45:25,917
Eat!

400
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,378
Get up, you're hopeless.

401
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,943
Clean all the pottery and cutlery.

402
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:53,750
Wall is low, power of Buddha is high.

403
00:46:53,787 --> 00:46:57,015
He's fallen into it.

404
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:02,884
Don't laugh, he's only a novice.

405
00:47:05,887 --> 00:47:07,682
- Enter the dining hall.
- Yes.

406
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,176
San Ta, you're terrific...

407
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:19,143
Concentrate. You'll find a way.

408
00:49:19,186 --> 00:49:22,744
Keep practicing day and night. Go!

409
00:49:51,853 --> 00:49:53,546
Stop!

410
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:00,908
Wood drifts, its buoyancy is limited.

411
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:06,647
The harder you step, faster it sinks.

412
00:50:08,653 --> 00:50:10,585
- San Ta.
- Yes.

413
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:13,142
Throw the plate hard into water.

414
00:50:19,053 --> 00:50:21,951
The plate sinks in water.

415
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:26,783
Just like the wood you stepped upon.

416
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:42,109
I keep the plate in motion, balanced.

417
00:50:42,153 --> 00:50:47,983
Power takes you forward, firmness
balances the body.

418
00:50:48,019 --> 00:50:49,815
Uniformity of mind.

419
00:50:49,853 --> 00:50:52,444
Focuses power.

420
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:55,680
You must keep this point in mind.

421
00:51:16,886 --> 00:51:20,875
Power, balance, speed.

422
00:52:23,186 --> 00:52:27,209
Power, balance, speed.
Right.

423
00:52:28,919 --> 00:52:30,579
Sir, I...

424
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,415
Go!

425
00:52:33,186 --> 00:52:37,414
I beg you to teach me, master.

426
00:52:40,486 --> 00:52:43,543
The 34th chamber focuses on training
arms' strength.

427
00:52:43,586 --> 00:52:49,950
Fist, palm, knife, sword, pole, spear.

428
00:52:49,986 --> 00:52:53,419
All depends on the arm's strength. Look...

429
00:52:59,453 --> 00:53:01,476
This is the basic process.

430
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,679
Carry the water up the slope.

431
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:10,311
Pour it down to keep it flowing.

432
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:17,411
Remember, arms must be straight.

433
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:22,374
You should carry water everyday.

434
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:24,409
To build up arm strength. Go now.

435
00:53:24,453 --> 00:53:25,578
Yes.

436
00:55:20,652 --> 00:55:25,017
I didn't think you'd make it so soon.

437
00:55:30,419 --> 00:55:35,442
Don't help others when they practice.

438
00:55:35,485 --> 00:55:38,451
It'll only ruin them.

439
00:55:38,485 --> 00:55:39,815
Yes.

440
00:55:39,852 --> 00:55:44,614
You've violated our rule. Leave...

441
00:55:44,652 --> 00:55:46,175
Sir...

442
00:55:46,219 --> 00:55:49,776
Go to the 33rd Chamber.

443
00:55:52,952 --> 00:55:54,474
Thank you, sir.

444
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:58,176
This chamber is comparatively easier.

445
00:55:58,219 --> 00:56:01,651
Whenever you hear me knock the wood.

446
00:56:01,686 --> 00:56:06,210
Strike the gong.

447
00:56:11,652 --> 00:56:14,914
Sir, I'm here to learn kung fu, not...

448
00:56:14,952 --> 00:56:20,146
Don't belittle the bamboo poles.
Ji Wei.

449
00:56:20,186 --> 00:56:21,209
Yes.

450
00:56:28,752 --> 00:56:31,116
The hammer weighs catties.

451
00:56:31,153 --> 00:56:33,880
It is fitted into a 12-ft pole.

452
00:56:33,919 --> 00:56:36,680
With a foot-long pole,
hammer weighs catties.

453
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:41,209
With the pole extended,
it now weighs catties.

454
00:56:41,253 --> 00:56:45,151
How much can your wrists bear?

455
00:56:45,186 --> 00:56:48,118
I'm willing to try.

456
00:57:05,652 --> 00:57:09,085
Add on more feet.

457
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,118
Ready...

458
00:58:07,552 --> 00:58:09,075
Keep practicing.

459
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:43,309
My respects to the abbot.

460
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:48,478
You've left the Wrist Room?

461
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:53,144
Yes, the overseer said I could leave.

462
01:00:53,185 --> 01:00:57,515
Good. Starting today...

463
01:00:57,552 --> 01:00:59,381
As a reward for your diligence.

464
01:00:59,419 --> 01:01:05,545
You'll be in charge of Sutra Room.

465
01:01:05,585 --> 01:01:07,278
Thank you, abbot.

466
01:01:21,285 --> 01:01:26,479
Brother, San Ta is ambitious.

467
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:28,848
He's not like our Buddhist brothers.

468
01:01:28,885 --> 01:01:35,409
It's peaceful here in this temple.

469
01:01:35,452 --> 01:01:39,282
But outside it's turbulent.

470
01:01:39,318 --> 01:01:43,307
We may need someone like him.

471
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:57,312
Please guide me, sir.

472
01:02:03,118 --> 01:02:07,574
Stand between the two burning incense.

473
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:08,914
Yes.

474
01:02:21,252 --> 01:02:23,548
Anyone practicing martial arts...

475
01:02:23,585 --> 01:02:30,484
Must be sharp-eyed.
Watch the flame.

476
01:02:43,951 --> 01:02:47,008
When the flame oscillates...

477
01:02:47,052 --> 01:02:50,109
Your eyes should follow.

478
01:02:50,152 --> 01:02:54,016
But remember,

479
01:02:54,052 --> 01:02:59,007
Your head must not move.

480
01:03:02,185 --> 01:03:03,810
Start.

481
01:04:12,185 --> 01:04:17,345
Told you not to move your head.
Again.

482
01:04:42,285 --> 01:04:46,308
Right, the target has disappeared.

483
01:04:46,352 --> 01:04:50,114
But still, the eyes shouldn't move.

484
01:04:53,685 --> 01:04:59,879
Eyes be bright, limbs be agile.

485
01:04:59,918 --> 01:05:04,374
This is the way to do it.

486
01:05:04,419 --> 01:05:05,714
Yes.

487
01:05:10,152 --> 01:05:12,209
Turn around.

488
01:05:35,951 --> 01:05:40,679
San Ta, hit the reflecting poles.

489
01:06:33,951 --> 01:06:39,747
You're my most outstanding pupil.

490
01:06:41,351 --> 01:06:43,442
Thank you, sir.

491
01:06:43,618 --> 01:06:46,107
Head Chamber.

492
01:07:18,785 --> 01:07:20,512
Continue

493
01:07:33,551 --> 01:07:35,540
Don't lower your head. Stand up.

494
01:07:37,518 --> 01:07:38,245
Hands on your waist.

495
01:07:38,284 --> 01:07:40,477
Use your head to hit the sand bags.

496
01:07:40,518 --> 01:07:42,245
Then burn incense before the Buddha.

497
01:07:42,284 --> 01:07:43,580
Yes.

498
01:08:02,418 --> 01:08:03,441
Again.

499
01:08:14,918 --> 01:08:16,144
Get up.

500
01:08:16,184 --> 01:08:18,116
Sir, I...

501
01:08:18,151 --> 01:08:22,379
Collapse so soon? Get up now.

502
01:08:22,418 --> 01:08:24,680
Continue. Go on.

503
01:09:00,051 --> 01:09:01,381
Sir.

504
01:09:01,418 --> 01:09:04,873
San Ta.
Were it not for years' hard work.

505
01:09:04,918 --> 01:09:08,975
You might not even take one step
into this alley.

506
01:09:09,018 --> 01:09:13,643
San Ta, head is the most important.

507
01:09:13,685 --> 01:09:17,378
And the last phase in the training.

508
01:09:17,418 --> 01:09:19,475
After going through it,

509
01:09:19,518 --> 01:09:22,382
You can learn fighting and weapons.

510
01:09:29,051 --> 01:09:30,347
Offer the incense.

511
01:09:38,418 --> 01:09:41,441
Use your strength to hit it. Get up!

512
01:09:41,484 --> 01:09:46,439
Come on, get up!

513
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:22,939
You've set a new record.

514
01:10:24,051 --> 01:10:29,484
You've completed the basic skills...

515
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:33,416
Of the chambers in months' time.

516
01:10:33,451 --> 01:10:35,679
I can't do it without the teachers.

517
01:10:35,718 --> 01:10:42,116
You can now practise boxing...

518
01:10:42,151 --> 01:10:46,083
Knife, baton and other skills.

519
01:10:46,117 --> 01:10:47,878
Yes.

520
01:10:47,917 --> 01:10:50,349
Justice Officer.

521
01:10:50,384 --> 01:10:54,578
I'll make him head of Dharma House.

522
01:11:00,284 --> 01:11:02,648
San Ta, greet these two abbots.

523
01:11:02,685 --> 01:11:04,344
Yes.

524
01:11:39,384 --> 01:11:40,680
Stop!

525
01:11:56,518 --> 01:11:57,575
Continue!

526
01:12:58,584 --> 01:12:59,607
San Ta!

527
01:13:06,251 --> 01:13:10,240
Leg Chamber.

528
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:27,246
Sir.

529
01:13:27,284 --> 01:13:32,239
San Ta, not bad, not bad.

530
01:13:36,484 --> 01:13:37,541
Sword Chamber.

531
01:15:35,017 --> 01:15:36,210
Turn around faster.

532
01:16:53,684 --> 01:16:55,513
Good fellow.

533
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:15,141
San Ta.

534
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:34,610
San Ta, it's commendable of you.

535
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:36,843
To master all chambers' kung fu...

536
01:17:36,884 --> 01:17:40,316
In only years.

537
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:45,942
Now I'll make you deputy overseer of...

538
01:17:45,984 --> 01:17:48,449
Any of the chambers.

539
01:17:48,483 --> 01:17:54,279
Brother, San Ta's post is high enough.

540
01:17:54,316 --> 01:17:56,509
He's been promoted times in years.

541
01:17:56,550 --> 01:17:59,880
With his present skill,

542
01:17:59,917 --> 01:18:03,405
He's qualified to be deputy overseer.

543
01:18:03,450 --> 01:18:07,473
Shaolin arts has existed for years.

544
01:18:07,517 --> 01:18:09,881
We mustn't make a hasty decision.

545
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:15,247
- What do you think?
- In my opinion...

546
01:18:15,283 --> 01:18:17,579
Let him fight me with any weapon.

547
01:18:17,617 --> 01:18:22,413
If he wins, he can be an overseer.

548
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:24,882
You heard what he said.

549
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:29,349
You heard what he said.

550
01:18:29,383 --> 01:18:31,906
What do you think?

551
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:34,279
I dare not.

552
01:18:34,316 --> 01:18:39,874
It's my idea. If you win...

553
01:18:39,917 --> 01:18:44,009
You can take charge of any chamber.

554
01:18:44,051 --> 01:18:47,813
Excuse me then, sir.

555
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:16,338
Watch out.

556
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:58,773
Thank you, sir. I've lost.

557
01:20:02,917 --> 01:20:04,746
You may challenge me any time.

558
01:21:55,883 --> 01:21:58,747
How many times have I tapped you?

559
01:21:58,783 --> 01:21:59,806
17 times.

560
01:21:59,849 --> 01:22:03,872
I could've hurt you with the blade.

561
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:11,376
You're right.

562
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:15,349
I'll continue with my practice.

563
01:22:20,883 --> 01:22:25,145
Brother, I think he'll never win.

564
01:22:25,183 --> 01:22:27,808
Not necessarily.

565
01:23:59,016 --> 01:24:00,879
What weapon is San Ta using?

566
01:24:00,916 --> 01:24:05,178
A three-jointed stick invented
by himself.

567
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:44,141
Good, that blow was not bad.

568
01:24:46,783 --> 01:24:47,771
Go on!

569
01:24:53,417 --> 01:24:54,780
Sir, are you alright?

570
01:24:54,816 --> 01:24:58,112
San Ta, I still have my weapons.

571
01:25:30,216 --> 01:25:31,738
Excuse me.

572
01:25:31,783 --> 01:25:35,374
Abbot,

573
01:25:35,416 --> 01:25:38,439
San Ta can take charge of
any chamber.

574
01:25:38,482 --> 01:25:44,437
San Ta, you can choose
to take charge of...

575
01:25:44,482 --> 01:25:50,437
Any of the chambers except...

576
01:25:50,482 --> 01:25:51,846
The Top Chamber.
Your Buddhism...

577
01:25:51,883 --> 01:25:54,508
Attainment is not advanced enough.

578
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:55,845
Abbot,

579
01:25:55,883 --> 01:25:58,076
I've not yet made up my mind.

580
01:25:58,116 --> 01:26:02,343
Never mind. I'll give you three days.

581
01:26:02,382 --> 01:26:04,507
Thank you, abbot.

582
01:26:05,482 --> 01:26:09,006
There're only 35 chambers in Shaolin.

583
01:26:09,050 --> 01:26:10,743
There isn't a 36th chamber.

584
01:26:10,783 --> 01:26:15,841
I know. I'd like to create it...

585
01:26:15,883 --> 01:26:18,314
This 36th chamber is...

586
01:26:18,349 --> 01:26:20,679
It's a pity Shaolin martial arts...

587
01:26:20,716 --> 01:26:23,841
Is confined solely to the temple.

588
01:26:23,883 --> 01:26:28,338
It should be taught widely to all.

589
01:26:28,382 --> 01:26:32,439
That's my idea for the new chamber.

590
01:26:32,482 --> 01:26:36,414
To teach martial arts to laymen.

591
01:26:40,983 --> 01:26:44,346
We don't involve in worldly affairs.

592
01:26:44,382 --> 01:26:48,042
Nor do we admit secular pupils.

593
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:50,708
Forget it.

594
01:26:50,749 --> 01:26:52,874
Abbot, this affects the handing down...

595
01:26:52,916 --> 01:26:54,245
Of Shaolin martial arts to posterity.

596
01:26:54,282 --> 01:26:56,748
Please let me enroll promising youths.

597
01:26:56,783 --> 01:26:58,544
And train them in the 36th chamber.

598
01:26:58,582 --> 01:27:01,048
Nonsense, how dare you talk back?

599
01:27:08,016 --> 01:27:09,538
I don't mean to...

600
01:27:09,582 --> 01:27:12,514
- Shut up!
- I must ask you to reconsider, abbot.

601
01:27:12,549 --> 01:27:14,276
Justice Officer.

602
01:27:14,315 --> 01:27:14,906
Yes.

603
01:27:14,949 --> 01:27:22,473
Our pupil San Ta should be punished.

604
01:27:22,516 --> 01:27:24,675
Yes.

605
01:27:28,315 --> 01:27:30,543
San Ta, you've violated our rule.

606
01:27:30,582 --> 01:27:34,309
You have to collect contributions.

607
01:27:34,349 --> 01:27:36,815
Don't return unless the book is full.

608
01:27:36,849 --> 01:27:42,713
Yes. Abbot, I deserve punishment.

609
01:27:42,749 --> 01:27:47,374
Leave tomorrow morning.

610
01:28:15,282 --> 01:28:16,714
Chiang Tai

611
01:28:33,215 --> 01:28:38,204
You want to pray for Chiang Tai?

612
01:28:38,249 --> 01:28:39,909
They all died.

613
01:28:39,949 --> 01:28:42,847
They were buried in East cemetery.

614
01:28:42,883 --> 01:28:45,872
Go there and pray for them.

615
01:28:57,215 --> 01:29:01,443
Uncle Wei, may you rest in peace.
We will...

616
01:29:01,482 --> 01:29:05,505
complete your mission and restore
the Ming rule.

617
01:29:05,549 --> 01:29:06,572
Hung Hsi-kuan.

618
01:29:06,616 --> 01:29:08,445
Hung Hsi-kuan, I knew you'd be here
to bury your accomplices.

619
01:29:08,482 --> 01:29:09,539
Run!

620
01:29:09,582 --> 01:29:10,570
Go!...

621
01:29:13,716 --> 01:29:15,614
See if you can escape.

622
01:29:15,649 --> 01:29:22,571
Good! I'll kill you one after another.

623
01:29:22,616 --> 01:29:26,139
Go ahead and try.

624
01:30:11,716 --> 01:30:14,204
Tang San-yao, you're so malicious.

625
01:30:14,249 --> 01:30:16,715
Your vice will be punished.

626
01:30:16,749 --> 01:30:19,146
Scram, bloody monk.

627
01:30:19,182 --> 01:30:21,148
Master, please stay out of this.

628
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:22,739
So you're an accomplice.

629
01:30:30,149 --> 01:30:33,513
Tang San-yao, remember years ago,

630
01:30:33,549 --> 01:30:35,811
You confiscated my school
and my shop.

631
01:30:35,849 --> 01:30:37,212
And kill my whole family?

632
01:30:40,816 --> 01:30:44,145
You're Liu Yu-de, a fugitive! Get him.

633
01:30:49,282 --> 01:30:50,578
Go help your brothers.

634
01:30:50,616 --> 01:30:51,775
Okay!

635
01:32:30,082 --> 01:32:33,537
You're a Buddhist, show mercy.

636
01:32:33,582 --> 01:32:36,741
Even Buddha has to conquer evil.

637
01:32:36,782 --> 01:32:39,248
A monk should not kill.

638
01:32:39,282 --> 01:32:41,612
A monk cannot but I can. I'll do it!

639
01:32:47,748 --> 01:32:51,408
Tang San-yao, you've killed my men.

640
01:32:51,449 --> 01:32:53,506
I'll stab you 1,000 times!

641
01:32:58,215 --> 01:33:01,340
Amitabha Buddha.

642
01:33:10,582 --> 01:33:14,604
Thank God. Today, our martyrs...

643
01:33:14,648 --> 01:33:18,274
Can see you lying dead here.

644
01:33:20,449 --> 01:33:24,608
Master, I want to learn martial arts.

645
01:33:24,648 --> 01:33:26,410
Please accept me as your pupil.

646
01:33:29,615 --> 01:33:34,071
Good. I've come from Shaolin.

647
01:33:34,115 --> 01:33:36,513
To enroll promising youths.

648
01:33:36,549 --> 01:33:40,242
Hsi-kuan, is Tien Ta still in Canton?

649
01:33:40,282 --> 01:33:41,645
Yes.

650
01:33:41,682 --> 01:33:47,343
His hand is stained with Han's blood.

651
01:33:47,382 --> 01:33:53,974
We must eliminate him at all costs.

652
01:33:55,915 --> 01:33:57,847
We'll plan well.

653
01:33:57,882 --> 01:34:00,178
Find a hideout first.

654
01:34:00,215 --> 01:34:01,646
Don't act rashly.

655
01:34:01,682 --> 01:34:05,479
Do you know of other hot-blooded youths?

656
01:34:05,515 --> 01:34:10,141
Yes, Tung Qian-jin is another.

657
01:34:10,215 --> 01:34:15,011
Tung Qian-jin, Commander's orders.

658
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:16,912
Make a batch of wheels.

659
01:34:25,082 --> 01:34:27,071
Deliver them within one month.

660
01:34:27,115 --> 01:34:29,172
I can't, it'll take one year.

661
01:34:29,215 --> 01:34:31,976
One year? Are you turning me down?

662
01:34:35,682 --> 01:34:41,377
Do you want to join the dead?

663
01:34:41,416 --> 01:34:43,608
Want my help?

664
01:34:45,915 --> 01:34:47,881
I'll teach you to be smarter.

665
01:34:54,515 --> 01:34:55,413
Beat him up!

666
01:35:08,315 --> 01:35:10,803
Are you going to do it or not?

667
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,212
Not over my dead body.

668
01:36:16,815 --> 01:36:19,008
It is better to use the haft.

669
01:36:50,415 --> 01:36:53,643
Help!

670
01:36:53,682 --> 01:36:56,705
Do you still want the wheels made?

671
01:36:56,748 --> 01:36:58,146
No, no!

672
01:36:58,182 --> 01:36:59,841
Damn you!

673
01:36:59,882 --> 01:37:01,814
Good! Good!

674
01:37:07,448 --> 01:37:09,471
Master, Master!

675
01:37:19,281 --> 01:37:24,646
Master... Let me follow you.

676
01:37:24,682 --> 01:37:27,273
Why?

677
01:37:27,314 --> 01:37:30,076
I admire you. Please accept me
as your disciple.

678
01:37:30,115 --> 01:37:31,671
Please take me as your pupil.

679
01:37:31,715 --> 01:37:35,670
Tung Qian-jin, what's wrong with you?

680
01:37:35,715 --> 01:37:37,874
You said you won't submit to anyone.

681
01:37:37,915 --> 01:37:41,745
And will challenge even the Gods?

682
01:37:41,782 --> 01:37:45,236
Why are you kowtowing to a monk now?

683
01:37:46,248 --> 01:37:48,373
What do you know?
He's not a monk.

684
01:37:48,415 --> 01:37:51,848
He's a Bodhisattva.

685
01:37:51,882 --> 01:37:53,370
He only said several words.

686
01:37:53,415 --> 01:37:57,313
And I scared the tartars away.

687
01:37:57,348 --> 01:38:02,337
So he's a living Bodhisattva?

688
01:38:02,381 --> 01:38:07,712
I'm only a monk from Shaolin Temple.

689
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:12,271
I taught you to avoid direct conflict.

690
01:38:12,314 --> 01:38:17,337
They've learnt kung fu, you haven't.

691
01:38:17,381 --> 01:38:21,041
Using a heavy weapon slows you down.

692
01:38:21,082 --> 01:38:22,911
And puts you at a disadvantage.

693
01:38:22,948 --> 01:38:24,311
Right.

694
01:38:24,348 --> 01:38:29,371
Lu Ah-cai, are you convinced now?

695
01:38:31,848 --> 01:38:33,677
Master, it makes sense.

696
01:38:44,715 --> 01:38:46,977
Lu Ah-cai, can you move?

697
01:38:55,915 --> 01:38:58,278
Lu Ah-cai, don't make hasty moves.

698
01:38:58,314 --> 01:39:00,303
Master, I'm convinced.

699
01:39:00,348 --> 01:39:01,974
Master, I'm convinced.

700
01:39:11,848 --> 01:39:13,040
Are you sure now?

701
01:39:13,081 --> 01:39:15,775
I am, I'm convinced.

702
01:39:15,815 --> 01:39:19,110
Master, please come in for some tea.

703
01:39:51,348 --> 01:39:54,041
Master, I'm really convinced.

704
01:40:02,682 --> 01:40:04,580
How did Tang San-yao die?

705
01:40:04,615 --> 01:40:08,638
You still haven't found out yet?

706
01:40:08,682 --> 01:40:10,238
He was chopped by a knife.

707
01:40:10,281 --> 01:40:15,646
I only want the man who chopped him.

708
01:40:15,682 --> 01:40:17,671
Yes, we're investigating.

709
01:40:17,715 --> 01:40:23,579
Kill all suspects.

710
01:40:23,615 --> 01:40:24,672
Yes.

711
01:40:29,548 --> 01:40:34,776
You must be on the alert.

712
01:40:34,815 --> 01:40:37,076
Yes.

713
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:40,512
This is General Tien Ta's residence.

714
01:40:40,548 --> 01:40:43,708
He patrols the city every day.

715
01:40:43,748 --> 01:40:46,578
And he must pass through this street.

716
01:40:46,615 --> 01:40:49,944
When he goes to the city gates,

717
01:40:49,981 --> 01:40:54,141
shops on both sides of the street.

718
01:40:54,181 --> 01:41:00,580
Made it difficult for us to get him.

719
01:41:06,281 --> 01:41:09,145
Any households on this street?

720
01:41:09,181 --> 01:41:10,272
Yes.

721
01:41:12,581 --> 01:41:13,910
There is a rice-miller's shop.

722
01:41:13,947 --> 01:41:16,539
Back to back with the General's residence.

723
01:41:16,581 --> 01:41:18,570
Are there many people living there?

724
01:41:18,615 --> 01:41:19,807
There seems to be only one person.

725
01:41:32,781 --> 01:41:34,042
Rice-miller's Shop

726
01:41:45,214 --> 01:41:46,578
Sir.

727
01:41:46,615 --> 01:41:48,706
Amitabha Buddha.

728
01:41:53,014 --> 01:41:54,446
Sir, I...

729
01:41:54,481 --> 01:41:57,675
No one would come for offerings
this late.

730
01:41:57,715 --> 01:41:58,737
What are you doing? Go away...

731
01:42:09,114 --> 01:42:12,841
What do you mean by that?
Go away!

732
01:42:17,947 --> 01:42:19,470
What do you want?

733
01:42:19,515 --> 01:42:21,572
Sir, please excuse me.

734
01:42:21,615 --> 01:42:22,910
What do you want?

735
01:42:22,947 --> 01:42:26,505
May I know your name, sir?

736
01:42:29,515 --> 01:42:31,413
My father died.

737
01:42:31,448 --> 01:42:33,380
Without telling me my name.

738
01:42:33,415 --> 01:42:35,506
So I have no name.

739
01:42:35,548 --> 01:42:38,480
I started milling rice when I was six.

740
01:42:38,515 --> 01:42:41,844
So they call me Miller Six.

741
01:42:41,881 --> 01:42:45,370
I'm San Ta. I'm from Shaolin Temple.

742
01:42:45,415 --> 01:42:50,870
People say that monks from Shaolin...

743
01:42:50,914 --> 01:42:53,812
Are excellent at kung fu. No wonder...

744
01:42:53,847 --> 01:42:55,836
I've practiced for several years.

745
01:42:55,881 --> 01:43:00,711
Having milled rice for many years...

746
01:43:00,747 --> 01:43:03,407
I also have...

747
01:43:06,481 --> 01:43:07,946
a pair of strong feet.

748
01:43:07,981 --> 01:43:13,107
Do you want to try them?

749
01:43:23,114 --> 01:43:25,410
I've drunk a bit too much today.

750
01:43:25,448 --> 01:43:30,107
But your footwork's not bad.

751
01:43:30,148 --> 01:43:34,705
Let's go in for a drink. Let's go!

752
01:43:34,747 --> 01:43:36,304
You can't stay here much longer.

753
01:43:36,348 --> 01:43:38,041
Why not?

754
01:43:38,081 --> 01:43:43,446
Very soon, something big will happen...

755
01:43:43,481 --> 01:43:45,344
in the General's residence.

756
01:43:51,814 --> 01:43:53,337
What is it?

757
01:43:53,381 --> 01:43:57,574
General Tien Ta's going to die here.

758
01:43:57,614 --> 01:44:01,047
How can you say something like that?

759
01:44:01,081 --> 01:44:02,808
Aren't you afraid of being executed?

760
01:44:02,847 --> 01:44:06,540
I beg you to leave here at once, please!

761
01:44:06,580 --> 01:44:08,046
I don't care whether you came from...

762
01:44:08,081 --> 01:44:09,910
Shaolin or Linshao Temple,

763
01:44:09,947 --> 01:44:11,640
Please just leave. I beg you.

764
01:44:11,681 --> 01:44:14,977
The Ching tartars killed so many people.

765
01:44:15,014 --> 01:44:17,707
Don't you want to fight back?

766
01:44:19,448 --> 01:44:22,414
I'm only a rice miller. Even if I did...

767
01:44:22,448 --> 01:44:25,777
What good will it do? I'd rather drink.

768
01:44:25,814 --> 01:44:30,270
People continue to suffer because...

769
01:44:30,314 --> 01:44:33,371
Too many people have that attitude.

770
01:44:33,415 --> 01:44:36,313
You'd put it more plainly.

771
01:44:36,348 --> 01:44:39,711
I want to borrow your place.

772
01:44:39,747 --> 01:44:42,236
No... If you do...

773
01:44:42,281 --> 01:44:43,803
I won't be able to stay here anymore.

774
01:44:43,847 --> 01:44:46,472
Don't worry. I'll take you to Shaolin.

775
01:45:01,014 --> 01:45:07,469
Go away...!
Come here, on your knees...

776
01:45:16,281 --> 01:45:18,906
Lord Cheng, we caught them...

777
01:45:18,947 --> 01:45:20,208
Near the cemetery.

778
01:45:20,248 --> 01:45:22,475
Kill them all!

779
01:45:22,514 --> 01:45:23,775
Yes.

780
01:45:23,814 --> 01:45:25,371
Stop!

781
01:45:28,281 --> 01:45:32,338
Lord Cheng, I killed Tang San-yao.

782
01:45:32,380 --> 01:45:35,313
Not them!

783
01:45:35,348 --> 01:45:37,211
You?

784
01:45:37,248 --> 01:45:42,805
How did you kill him?

785
01:45:50,347 --> 01:45:51,404
With this.

786
01:45:51,447 --> 01:45:52,708
- Take him.
- Yes.

787
01:46:07,714 --> 01:46:08,907
Where did you learn it?

788
01:46:10,814 --> 01:46:12,212
In Shaolin Temple.

789
01:47:58,081 --> 01:48:01,171
- Report to the General! Quick!
- Yes.

790
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:44,612
Let's go!

791
01:48:57,047 --> 01:49:00,014
Master, we're outnumbered.

792
01:49:00,047 --> 01:49:01,911
Yes, there're so many of them.

793
01:49:01,947 --> 01:49:05,004
Everyday they wake me up early.

794
01:49:09,013 --> 01:49:11,536
Will you please calm down?

795
01:49:11,580 --> 01:49:14,375
No, I can't. I'm Miller Six.

796
01:49:18,747 --> 01:49:20,542
This is flour.

797
01:49:23,614 --> 01:49:29,444
Commanders Tang and Cheng
are famous.

798
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,105
Their failure this time is because...

799
01:49:33,047 --> 01:49:34,946
If more monks were here...

800
01:49:34,980 --> 01:49:38,936
There might be a rebellion in Canton!

801
01:49:38,980 --> 01:49:40,344
Yes...

802
01:49:43,013 --> 01:49:47,105
Tomorrow I'll bring some men
to capture him.

803
01:49:47,147 --> 01:49:51,637
Even if I have to go to Shaolin.

804
01:49:51,681 --> 01:49:53,942
The General's Mansion

805
01:50:05,414 --> 01:50:07,971
Go, go at once... Run!

806
01:51:05,580 --> 01:51:06,909
Give me a sword.

807
01:51:26,480 --> 01:51:30,412
You, a monk, joining the rebels!

808
01:51:35,313 --> 01:51:37,279
A Buddhist has to conquer evil.

809
01:51:37,313 --> 01:51:40,211
How many lives have you taken?

810
01:51:40,247 --> 01:51:45,907
I've killed many, but never a monk.

811
01:54:34,680 --> 01:54:36,805
36th Chamber

812
01:54:50,746 --> 01:54:51,939
Stop!

813
01:55:22,147 --> 01:55:24,612
The sweeping tail of the dancing dragon.

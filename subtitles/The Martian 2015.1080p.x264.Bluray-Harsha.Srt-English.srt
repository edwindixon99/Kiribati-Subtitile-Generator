00:02:05,843 --> 00:02:06,877
<i>All right, team,</i>

3
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,078
<i>stay in sight of each other.</i>

4
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:09,814
<i>Let's make NASA proud today.</i>

5
00:02:10,747 --> 00:02:12,448
<i>How's it looking
over there, Watney?</i>

6
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:13,951
<i>Well, you'll
be happy to hear...</i>

7
00:02:13,952 --> 00:02:16,886
<i>that in Grid Section 14-28,</i>

8
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,822
<i>the particles were
predominantly coarse...</i>

9
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:23,192
but in 29, they're much finer...

10
00:02:23,193 --> 00:02:25,294
and they should be ideal for chem analysis.

11
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:26,662
<i>Oh, wow. Did
everybody hear that?</i>

12
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:28,597
<i>Mark just discovered dirt.</i>

13
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:29,866
<i>Should we alert the media?</i>

14
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,834
<i>Sorry, what are
you doing today, Martinez?</i>

15
00:02:31,835 --> 00:02:33,735
Making sure the MAV is still upright?

16
00:02:33,736 --> 00:02:34,971
<i>I'd like you to know</i>

17
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:36,038
<i>that visual inspection
of the equipment...</i>

18
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:37,739
<i>is imperative to mission success.</i>

19
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,644
<i>I also would like to report
that the MAV is still upright.</i>

20
00:02:40,645 --> 00:02:42,012
<i>Watney,</i>

21
00:02:42,013 --> 00:02:43,245
<i>you keep leaving your channel open...</i>

22
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,215
<i>which leads to Martinez responding...</i>

23
00:02:45,216 --> 00:02:46,583
<i>which leads to all of us listening...</i>

24
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:48,217
<i>which leads to me being annoyed.</i>

25
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:49,619
<i>Roger that.</i>

26
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,853
<i>Martinez, the captain
would like you to please...</i>

27
00:02:50,854 --> 00:02:52,055
shut your smart mouth.

28
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,392
We'd prefer to use a different adjective

29
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:57,428
to describe Martinez's mouth.

30
00:02:57,429 --> 00:02:58,894
<i>Did Beck just insult me?</i>

31
00:02:58,895 --> 00:03:01,263
<i>"Dr. Beck." And yes.</i>

32
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,667
Happy to turn the radios
off from here, Commander.

33
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:04,834
Just say the word.

34
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,269
Wait, Johanssen.

35
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,571
Constant communication is the hallmark...

36
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:08,839
Shut 'em off.

37
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,939
<i>No.</i>

38
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,675
No. Excuse me.

39
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,377
<i>I apologize for
my countrymen, Vogel.</i>

40
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:15,912
Accepted.

41
00:03:15,913 --> 00:03:17,847
How many samples do we need, Commander?

42
00:03:17,848 --> 00:03:19,448
<i>Seven.</i>

43
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,951
<i>100 grams each.</i>

44
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,059
We have a mission update. A storm warning.

45
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:30,626
<i>Commander, you should come inside.</i>

46
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,862
<i>You're gonna want to see this.</i>

47
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:33,096
What is it?

48
00:03:33,097 --> 00:03:34,364
<i>A storm warning.</i>

49
00:03:34,365 --> 00:03:35,865
I saw that in
this morning's briefing.

50
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:37,935
We'll be inside before it hits.

51
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:40,904
Yeah, they upgraded their estimate.

52
00:03:40,905 --> 00:03:42,773
The storm's gonna be a lot worse.

53
00:03:49,013 --> 00:03:51,282
<i>Martinez, how does it look?</i>

54
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:53,651
<i>Not good.</i>

55
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:59,221
"1,200 kilometers in diameter,
bearing 24.41 degrees."

56
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:00,423
That's tracking right towards us.

57
00:04:00,424 --> 00:04:02,125
"Based on current escalation,

58
00:04:02,126 --> 00:04:05,193
"estimated force of 8,600 newtons."

59
00:04:05,194 --> 00:04:06,596
What's the abort force?

60
00:04:06,597 --> 00:04:08,799
7,500.

61
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:11,634
<i>Anything more than
that and the MAV could tip.</i>

62
00:04:11,635 --> 00:04:13,036
Do we scrub?

63
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:15,072
Begin abort procedure.

64
00:04:15,073 --> 00:04:17,240
We are estimating
with a margin of error.

65
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:19,207
We could wait it out.

66
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:21,111
Let's wait it out.

67
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:23,981
Let's wait it out.

68
00:04:25,082 --> 00:04:27,250
Commander?

69
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:28,752
Prep emergency departure.

70
00:04:28,753 --> 00:04:30,254
Commander?

71
00:04:30,255 --> 00:04:32,390
We're scrubbed. That's an order.

72
00:04:42,734 --> 00:04:45,168
<i>Martinez, how long before take-off?</i>

73
00:04:45,169 --> 00:04:46,670
12 minutes.

74
00:04:49,672 --> 00:04:51,341
Visibility is almost zero.

75
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:52,541
Anyone gets lost,

76
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:53,844
hone in on my suit's telemetry.

77
00:04:53,845 --> 00:04:54,844
You ready?

78
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:56,747
Ready.

79
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,050
Commander, are you okay?

80
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:01,918
I'm okay.

81
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,276
Commander, we're at 10 degrees,

82
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:29,579
and the MAV is gonna tip at 12.3.

83
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,048
Hey! We might be able
to keep the MAV from tipping.

84
00:05:32,049 --> 00:05:33,784
How?

85
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:37,185
Use the cables from the
comms mast as guy-lines...

86
00:05:37,186 --> 00:05:39,122
anchor it with the Rover's.

87
00:05:39,123 --> 00:05:40,557
Watch out!

88
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,928
Watney!

89
00:05:46,397 --> 00:05:48,664
<i>Warning.
Suit breach detected.</i>

90
00:05:48,665 --> 00:05:49,632
What happened?

91
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:50,800
He was hit.

92
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:52,235
Watney, report.

93
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:53,870
Before we lost telemetry,

94
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,072
his decompression alarm went off.

95
00:05:55,073 --> 00:05:56,072
Where did you last see him?

96
00:05:56,073 --> 00:05:57,372
I don't know where he is.

97
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:58,173
What are the vitals on his suit?

98
00:05:58,174 --> 00:05:59,474
He's offline.

99
00:05:59,475 --> 00:06:00,976
A complete loss of signal on Watney.

100
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:02,312
- Beck!
- Yeah.

101
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:04,747
How long can he survive decompression?

102
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:06,315
Less than a minute.

103
00:06:06,316 --> 00:06:08,817
Line up, walk west.

104
00:06:08,818 --> 00:06:11,121
He may be prone. We
don't wanna step over him.

105
00:06:12,422 --> 00:06:13,923
Commander...

106
00:06:13,924 --> 00:06:15,824
We're at 10.5 degrees.

107
00:06:15,825 --> 00:06:17,060
<i>Warning. Excessive tilt.</i>

108
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:19,896
Tilting to 11 with all the gusts of wind.

109
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:21,497
Copy that.

110
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:24,200
Everyone, hone in on Martinez's suit.

111
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:26,336
It'll get you to airlock.
Get in, prep for launch.

112
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:27,937
What about you, Commander?

113
00:06:27,938 --> 00:06:30,673
I'm gonna search a
little longer. Get moving!

114
00:06:30,674 --> 00:06:32,209
Go!

115
00:06:35,513 --> 00:06:37,113
Watney!

116
00:06:37,114 --> 00:06:39,182
Watney, report!

117
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:41,750
<i>The MAV's at 11.6 degrees.</i>

118
00:06:41,751 --> 00:06:43,185
One good gust and we're tipping.

119
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:44,687
If it tips, you launch.

120
00:06:44,688 --> 00:06:46,356
You really think I'm
gonna leave you behind?

121
00:06:46,357 --> 00:06:48,423
<i>That's an order, Martinez.</i>

122
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:50,459
Mark!

123
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,063
Mark! Can you hear me?

124
00:06:55,366 --> 00:06:58,233
Martinez, what about the proximity radar?

125
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:00,103
Could that detect Watney's suit?

126
00:07:00,104 --> 00:07:01,570
It's made to see
the <i>Hermes</i> from orbit...

127
00:07:01,571 --> 00:07:03,406
not a little piece of
metal from a single suit.

128
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:04,574
<i>Give it a try.</i>

129
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:05,875
Roger.

130
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,077
What is she thinking? She knows

131
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,310
the infrared can't get through a sandstorm.

132
00:07:08,311 --> 00:07:10,613
She's grasping for anything.

133
00:07:10,614 --> 00:07:11,481
<i>We've got negative contact</i>

134
00:07:11,482 --> 00:07:12,748
<i>on the proximity radar.</i>

135
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:14,050
Nothing?

136
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:16,286
<i>No. I can barely see the Hab.</i>

137
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:19,188
Commander, I know you don't
wanna hear this, but...

138
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,890
Mark is dead.

139
00:07:21,892 --> 00:07:23,593
<i>Commander!</i>

140
00:07:23,594 --> 00:07:26,062
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you, man?

141
00:07:26,063 --> 00:07:27,296
My friend just died.

142
00:07:27,297 --> 00:07:28,664
I don't want my commander to die, too.

143
00:07:28,665 --> 00:07:29,933
<i>Stability warning.</i>

144
00:07:29,934 --> 00:07:31,500
We're tipping!

145
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:34,437
<i>Commander, you need to
get back to the ship, now!</i>

146
00:07:34,438 --> 00:07:36,006
13 degrees.

147
00:07:36,607 --> 00:07:38,341
If we pass balance, we'll never rock back.

148
00:07:38,342 --> 00:07:39,575
I've got one more trick left,

149
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:41,416
and then I'm following orders, Commander.

150
00:07:42,813 --> 00:07:44,913
You're firing the OMS?

151
00:07:44,914 --> 00:07:46,317
That's right.

152
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:51,721
Commander!

153
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,402
On my way.

154
00:07:56,325 --> 00:07:57,627
<i>Johanssen, let's go.</i>

155
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:07,470
Mark!

156
00:08:19,383 --> 00:08:21,151
<i>We're at 11.5 and holding.</i>

157
00:08:24,455 --> 00:08:25,956
<i>Ready to go on your command.</i>

158
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:29,393
Ready to launch.

159
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,961
Commander.

160
00:08:31,962 --> 00:08:33,696
I need you to verbally
tell me whether or not to.

161
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:35,199
Launch.

162
00:09:16,506 --> 00:09:18,106
<i>At around 4:30 a.m.</i>

163
00:09:18,107 --> 00:09:19,674
<i>Central Standard Time...</i>

164
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:21,977
<i>our satellites detected a storm</i>

165
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:25,014
<i>approaching the</i> Ares
3<i> mission site on Mars.</i>

166
00:09:25,015 --> 00:09:28,784
<i>At 6:45, the storm had
escalated to severe...</i>

167
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,855
<i>and we had no choice but
to abort the mission.</i>

168
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:34,256
<i>Thanks to the quick action
of Commander Lewis...</i>

169
00:09:34,257 --> 00:09:37,726
<i>astronauts Beck, Johanssen,
Martinez and Vogel...</i>

170
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:40,630
<i>were all able to reach
the Mars Ascent Vehicle...</i>

171
00:09:40,631 --> 00:09:44,168
<i>and perform an emergency
launch at 7:28 Central Time.</i>

172
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:47,870
Unfortunately, during the evacuation...

173
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:51,740
astronaut Mark Watney was
struck by debris and killed.

174
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:55,044
Commander Lewis and the rest of her team...

175
00:09:55,045 --> 00:09:57,480
were able to intercept
safely with the <i>Hermes</i>

176
00:09:57,481 --> 00:09:59,615
and are now heading home.

177
00:09:59,616 --> 00:10:02,485
But Mark Watney is dead.

178
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:03,486
Director Sanders!

179
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,656
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

180
00:10:46,963 --> 00:10:49,365
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

181
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,474
<i>Oxygen level...</i>

182
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:18,221
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

183
00:15:17,434 --> 00:15:19,369
Fuck.

184
00:15:48,365 --> 00:15:49,664
Okay.

185
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:51,400
<i>Okay.</i>

186
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:57,440
<i>Hello, this is Mark Watney, astronaut.</i>

187
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:01,009
<i>I'm entering this log for the record...</i>

188
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,813
<i>in case I don't make it.</i>

189
00:16:06,015 --> 00:16:10,318
<i>It is 06:53 on Sol 19...</i>

190
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:13,589
<i>and I'm alive.</i>

191
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,024
<i>Obviously.</i>

192
00:16:16,025 --> 00:16:18,561
<i>But I'm guessing that's
gonna come as a surprise</i>

193
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:22,030
<i>to my crewmates and to NASA.</i>

194
00:16:22,031 --> 00:16:24,967
<i>And to the entire world, really, so...</i>

195
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:29,572
<i>Surprise.</i>

196
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:32,909
<i>I did not die on Sol 18.</i>

197
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,043
<i>Best I can figure...</i>

198
00:16:35,044 --> 00:16:37,279
<i>this length of our primary
communications antenna</i>

199
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,746
<i>broke off...</i>

200
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,982
<i>and tore through my bio-monitor...</i>

201
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:43,719
<i>and ripped a hole in me as well.</i>

202
00:16:44,254 --> 00:16:47,356
<i>But the antenna and the blood, really,</i>

203
00:16:47,357 --> 00:16:49,558
<i>managed to seal the
breach in my suit...</i>

204
00:16:49,559 --> 00:16:51,260
<i>which kept me alive,</i>

205
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,863
<i>even though the crew must
have thought I was dead.</i>

206
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,133
<i>I have no way to contact NASA.</i>

207
00:16:57,134 --> 00:17:00,101
<i>And even if I could, it's
gonna be four years...</i>

208
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,738
<i>until a manned mission can reach me.</i>

209
00:17:03,405 --> 00:17:05,975
<i>And I'm in a Hab
designed to last 31 days.</i>

210
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:08,377
<i>If the oxygenator breaks,
I'm gonna suffocate.</i>

211
00:17:08,378 --> 00:17:11,013
<i>If the water reclaimer
breaks, I'll die of thirst.</i>

212
00:17:11,014 --> 00:17:13,215
<i>If the Hab breaches, I'm
just gonna, kind of...</i>

213
00:17:13,216 --> 00:17:14,750
<i>implode.</i>

214
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:18,687
<i>And if by some miracle,
none of that happens...</i>

215
00:17:19,156 --> 00:17:21,591
<i>eventually I'm gonna run out of food.</i>

216
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,193
<i>So...</i>

217
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,629
<i>yeah.</i>

218
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,835
<i>Yeah.</i>

219
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:23,145
I'm not gonna die here.

220
00:20:02,552 --> 00:20:04,321
32...

221
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,856
33...

222
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,160
34...

223
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:12,828
35, 36.

224
00:20:12,829 --> 00:20:15,697
Sweet and sour chicken.

225
00:20:47,797 --> 00:20:49,798
What do we got?

226
00:20:55,772 --> 00:20:58,640
<i>Right, let's do the math.</i>

227
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:02,378
<i>Our surface mission here was
supposed to last 31 sols.</i>

228
00:21:02,379 --> 00:21:04,012
<i>For redundancy, they sent
68 sols worth of food.</i>

229
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,547
<i>That's for 6 people.</i>

230
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:08,417
<i>So for just me, that's
gonna last 300 sols...</i>

231
00:21:08,418 --> 00:21:11,553
<i>which I figure I can
stretch to 400 if I ration.</i>

232
00:21:11,554 --> 00:21:14,724
<i>So I got to figure out a way to grow</i>

233
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:16,860
<i>three years' worth of food here.</i>

234
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,129
<i>On a planet where nothing grows.</i>

235
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:21,731
<i>Luckily...</i>

236
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,402
<i>I'm a botanist.</i>

237
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:34,277
<i>Mars will come to
fear my botany powers.</i>

238
00:22:18,988 --> 00:22:21,023
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

239
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,068
<i>Staple came out.</i>

240
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:24,487
Fuck you, Mars.

241
00:23:39,268 --> 00:23:41,270

247
00:24:43,065 --> 00:24:45,801
<i>The problem is water.</i>

248
00:24:45,802 --> 00:24:51,172
I have created 126 square meters of soil.

249
00:24:51,173 --> 00:24:53,307
<i>But every cubic meter of soil requires</i>

250
00:24:53,308 --> 00:24:56,410
<i>40 liters of water to be farmable.</i>

251
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,883
<i>So I gotta make a lot more water.</i>

252
00:25:00,449 --> 00:25:03,084
<i>Good thing is, I know the recipe.</i>

253
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,453
You take hydrogen, you
add oxygen, you burn.

254
00:25:05,454 --> 00:25:08,389
<i>Now, I have hundreds of liters</i>

255
00:25:08,390 --> 00:25:11,494
<i>of unused hydrazine at the MDV.</i>

256
00:25:11,495 --> 00:25:14,195
<i>If I run the hydrazine
over an iridium catalyst,</i>

257
00:25:14,196 --> 00:25:17,064
<i>it'll separate into N2 and H2.</i>

258
00:25:17,065 --> 00:25:21,235
<i>And then if I just direct the
hydrogen into a small area...</i>

259
00:25:21,236 --> 00:25:23,604
<i>and burn it.</i>

260
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,675
<i>Luckily, in the history of humanity...</i>

261
00:25:26,676 --> 00:25:28,543
nothing bad has ever happened

262
00:25:28,544 --> 00:25:31,947
from lighting hydrogen on fire.

263
00:25:31,948 --> 00:25:33,915
<i>NASA hates fire.</i>

264
00:25:33,916 --> 00:25:35,184
<i>Because of the whole</i>

265
00:25:35,185 --> 00:25:38,453
<i>"fire makes everybody
die in space" thing.</i>

266
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:40,255
<i>So, everything they
sent us up here with</i>

267
00:25:40,256 --> 00:25:41,889
<i>is flame-retardant...</i>

268
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,360
with the notable exception of...

269
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,463
Martinez's personal items.

270
00:25:48,998 --> 00:25:50,632
I am sorry, Martinez.

271
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,100
But if you didn't want me
to go through your stuff...

272
00:25:52,101 --> 00:25:55,537
you shouldn't have left me
for dead on a desolate planet.

273
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:56,905
By the way, I'm figuring you're gonna be

274
00:25:56,906 --> 00:25:59,475
fine with this, given my present situation.

275
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,475
<i>What's everybody doing?</i>

276
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:01,409
<i>Taking a holiday from being cool?</i>

277
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,479
Counting on you.

278
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:25,034
Whoo!

279
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:40,282
So, yeah, I blew myself up.

280
00:26:40,283 --> 00:26:42,851
Best guess...

281
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:48,391
I forgot to account
for the excess oxygen...

282
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,227
that I've been exhaling
when I did my calculations.

283
00:26:53,228 --> 00:26:55,999
Because I'm stupid.

284
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:00,435
Yeah, I'm gonna get back to work here...

285
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:03,573
just as soon as my ears stop ringing.

286
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:09,276
<i>Interesting side note,</i>

287
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:12,246
<i>this is actually how the Jet
Propulsion Lab was founded.</i>

288
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:15,851
<i>Five guys at Caltech were
trying to make rocket fuel...</i>

289
00:27:15,852 --> 00:27:17,285
<i>and they nearly burned down their dorm.</i>

290
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:18,853
<i>And rather than expel them...</i>

291
00:27:18,854 --> 00:27:21,723
<i>they banished them to a nearby farm,</i>

292
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,625
<i>told them to keep working.</i>

293
00:27:24,261 --> 00:27:25,960
<i>And now we have a space program.</i>

294
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:31,166
Okay.

295
00:28:47,944 --> 00:28:50,146
Hey, there.

296
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:01,223
<i>The nation was blessed</i>

297
00:29:01,224 --> 00:29:03,492
<i>to have Mark serving
in our space program.</i>

298
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,994
<i>While his loss will be deeply felt...</i>

299
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:08,730
<i>the men and women of NASA
will soldier forth...</i>

300
00:29:08,731 --> 00:29:11,299
<i>onward and upward in the
mission of their agency.</i>

301
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,334
<i>By doing so, they honor the legacy</i>

302
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,738
<i>Mark's leaving behind...</i>

303
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:19,741
<i>and they ensure his sacrifice
will not be in vain.</i>

304
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,321
<i>I have the honor of speaking</i>

305
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:34,589
<i>not only for the men
and women of NASA...</i>

306
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,358
<i>but for people all over the world...</i>

307
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,759
I thought you gave
a lovely speech, by the way.

308
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:43,130
I need you to authorize my satellite time.

309
00:29:43,131 --> 00:29:44,934
It's not gonna happen.

310
00:29:44,935 --> 00:29:46,936
We're funded for five <i>Ares</i> missions.

311
00:29:46,937 --> 00:29:49,505
I think I can get Congress
to authorize a sixth.

312
00:29:49,506 --> 00:29:51,806
- No.
- <i>Ares 3</i> evac'd after 18 sols.

313
00:29:51,807 --> 00:29:53,841
There's half a mission
worth of supplies up there.

314
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:54,909
I can sell it at a fraction

315
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,710
of the cost of a normal mission...

316
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:59,147
and all I have to know is
what's left of our assets.

317
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:00,849
You're not the only one
who needs satellite time.

318
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,851
We've got the <i>Ares 4</i>
supply missions coming up.

319
00:30:02,852 --> 00:30:05,020
We should be focusing on
the Schiaparelli Crater.

320
00:30:05,021 --> 00:30:06,053
Okay, we got 12 satellites up there.

321
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:07,456
Surely we can spare a few hours...

322
00:30:07,457 --> 00:30:09,556
It's not about the satellite time, Vince.

323
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,992
We're a public domain organization.

324
00:30:10,993 --> 00:30:12,026
We need to be transparent on this.

325
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:13,360
Okay.

326
00:30:13,361 --> 00:30:15,130
The second we point the
satellites at the Hab...

327
00:30:15,131 --> 00:30:16,230
I broadcast pictures

328
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,998
of Mark Watney's dead body to the world.

329
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:19,833
You're afraid of a PR problem?

330
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:21,402
Of course I'm afraid of a PR problem.

331
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,005
Another mission?

332
00:30:23,006 --> 00:30:25,608
Congress won't reimburse
us for a paper clip...

333
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:27,207
if I put a dead astronaut on the front page

334
00:30:27,208 --> 00:30:28,843
of <i>The Washington Post.</i>

335
00:30:28,844 --> 00:30:31,745
He's not going anywhere,
Teddy. I mean, he's not...

336
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,715
He's not gonna decompose, you know.

337
00:30:33,716 --> 00:30:35,216
He's gonna be up there forever.

338
00:30:35,217 --> 00:30:38,085
Meteorology estimates that
he'll be covered in sand...

339
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:40,022
from normal weather activity within a year.

340
00:30:40,023 --> 00:30:41,957
We can't wait a year. We got work to do.

341
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:43,524
<i>Ares 5</i> won't even
launch for five years.

342
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,293
We have plenty of time.

343
00:30:45,294 --> 00:30:46,761
Okay.

344
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:49,298
Okay.

345
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,268
Okay, consider this.

346
00:30:52,801 --> 00:30:56,370
Right now, the world's on our side.

347
00:30:56,371 --> 00:30:58,139
Sympathy for the Watney family.

348
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,508
<i>Ares 6</i> could bring his body home.

349
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:03,411
Now, we don't say that's
the purpose of the mission...

350
00:31:03,412 --> 00:31:05,412
but we make it clear that
that would be a part of it.

351
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:07,215
We frame it that way.

352
00:31:07,216 --> 00:31:10,819
More support from Congress.
But not if we wait a year.

353
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,321
We wait a year, nobody gives a shit.

354
00:31:46,188 --> 00:31:47,956
Vincent Kapoor?

355
00:31:53,028 --> 00:31:55,530
6-2.

356
00:31:55,531 --> 00:31:57,733
7-6-2.

357
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:03,772
Acidalia Planitia.

358
00:32:14,316 --> 00:32:15,817
What?

359
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:31,999
Hi. Security?

360
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,968
This is Mindy Park in SatCon.

361
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:36,772
I need the emergency
contact for Vincent Kapoor.

362
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:38,806
Yes, him.

363
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:40,909
Yes, it's an emergency!

364
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:47,248
How sure?

365
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:48,983
100%.

366
00:32:48,984 --> 00:32:50,952
You've got to be shitting me.

367
00:32:51,853 --> 00:32:53,856
Prove it to me.

368
00:32:55,124 --> 00:32:56,858
For a start...

369
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,294
the solar panels have been cleaned.

370
00:33:00,295 --> 00:33:01,862
They could have been cleaned by wind.

371
00:33:01,863 --> 00:33:04,399
Back it up. Look at <i>Rover 2.</i>

372
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,632
According to the logs,

373
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:06,735
Commander Lewis took it out on Sol 17...

374
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:09,204
plugged it into the Hab to recharge.

375
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:10,938
It's been moved.

376
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:12,640
She could have forgotten to log the move.

377
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:14,175
No, not likely.

378
00:33:14,176 --> 00:33:15,510
Why don't we just ask Lewis?

379
00:33:15,511 --> 00:33:17,312
Let's get on CAPCOM and
ask her directly right now.

380
00:33:17,313 --> 00:33:18,380
No. No.

381
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:19,714
If Watney is really alive,

382
00:33:19,715 --> 00:33:21,783
we don't want the <i>Ares 3</i> crew to know.

383
00:33:21,784 --> 00:33:23,418
How can you not tell them?

384
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,553
They have another 10
months on their trip home.

385
00:33:25,554 --> 00:33:26,888
Space travel is dangerous.

386
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:28,623
They need to be alert and undistracted.

387
00:33:28,624 --> 00:33:30,024
But they already think he's dead.

388
00:33:30,025 --> 00:33:31,059
And they'd be devastated to find out

389
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,227
they left him there alive.

390
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:35,630
I'm sorry, but you
have not thought this through.

391
00:33:35,631 --> 00:33:38,800
What are we gonna say? "Dear America...

392
00:33:38,801 --> 00:33:40,535
"remember that astronaut we killed

393
00:33:40,536 --> 00:33:42,169
"and had a really nice funeral for?

394
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,773
"Turns out he's alive and
we left him on Mars. Our bad.

395
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:46,573
"Sincerely, NASA."

396
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:49,142
Do you realize the shitstorm
that is about to hit us?

397
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:50,913
How are we going to handle the public?

398
00:33:52,046 --> 00:33:54,716
Legally, we have 24 hours
to release these pictures.

399
00:33:54,717 --> 00:33:56,118
We release a statement with them.

400
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:58,239
We don't want people
working it out on their own.

401
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:00,255
Yes, sir.

402
00:34:00,256 --> 00:34:01,989
But if my math is right,
he's going to starve to death

403
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:03,825
long before we can help him.

404
00:34:06,629 --> 00:34:09,030
Can you imagine what he's
going through up there?

405
00:34:09,031 --> 00:34:10,865
He's 50 million miles away from home.

406
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:12,233
He thinks he's totally alone.

407
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:14,102
He thinks we gave up on him.

408
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:17,705
What does that do to
a man, psychologically?

409
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:21,109
What the hell is he thinking right now?

410
00:34:25,147 --> 00:34:28,082
<i>I'm definitely gonna die up here...</i>

411
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:32,186
<i>if I have to listen to any
more god-awful disco music.</i>

412
00:34:32,187 --> 00:34:34,021
My God, Commander Lewis,

413
00:34:34,022 --> 00:34:35,957
couldn't you have packed
anything from this century?

414
00:34:35,958 --> 00:34:38,760
<i>♪ Turn the beat around ♪</i>

415
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:40,829
No, I am not gonna "turn the beat around."

416
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:42,665
I refuse to.

417
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:45,432
Mr. Sanders? Mr. Sanders?

418
00:34:46,801 --> 00:34:47,968
What attempts have been made

419
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:49,803
to make contact with Mark Watney?

420
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:52,073
We're working on it.

421
00:34:52,074 --> 00:34:53,673
Does he have enough supplies to survive?

422
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,443
We'll be looking into that.

423
00:34:55,444 --> 00:34:56,778
What does this say about the agency?

424
00:34:56,779 --> 00:34:57,845
Are you gonna resign?

425
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,081
No.

426
00:34:59,082 --> 00:35:00,850
Director Sanders!

427
00:35:05,154 --> 00:35:07,956
<i>It's time to
start thinking long term.</i>

428
00:35:07,957 --> 00:35:10,390
<i>The next NASA mission is</i> Ares 4...

429
00:35:10,391 --> 00:35:12,959
<i>and it's supposed to land
at Schiaparelli Crater...</i>

430
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,497
<i>3200 kilometers away.</i>

431
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:20,068
3,200 kilometers.

432
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:22,436
<i>In four years, when the
next</i> Ares <i>crew arrives,</i>

433
00:35:22,437 --> 00:35:24,072
<i>I'll have to be there.</i>

434
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:27,008
<i>Which means I have
to get to the crater.</i>

435
00:35:29,078 --> 00:35:31,111
<i>Okay, so here's the rub.</i>

436
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:33,015
<i>I've got one working Rover</i>

437
00:35:33,016 --> 00:35:36,684
<i>designed to go a max
distance of 35 kilometers...</i>

438
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:40,120
<i>before the battery has to
be recharged at the Hab.</i>

439
00:35:40,121 --> 00:35:42,256
<i>That's Problem A.</i>

440
00:35:42,257 --> 00:35:45,626
<i>Problem B is this
journey's gonna take me</i>

441
00:35:45,627 --> 00:35:49,062
<i>roughly 50 days to complete.</i>

442
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:51,566
<i>So I gotta live for 50 days...</i>

443
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,700
<i>inside a Rover with
marginal life support</i>

444
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,236
<i>the size of a small van.</i>

445
00:35:57,973 --> 00:35:59,606
<i>So, in the face of overwhelming odds,</i>

446
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:02,343
<i>I'm left with only one option.</i>

447
00:36:02,344 --> 00:36:05,781
<i>I'm gonna have to science
the shit out of this.</i>

448
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,077
Okay, so, success.

449
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,645
Uh...

450
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:43,986
I have doubled my battery life
by scavenging <i>Rover 1.</i>

451
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:47,990
But if I use the heater...

452
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:53,796
I will burn through half
my battery every day.

453
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:59,067
If I do not use my heater, I will be...

454
00:37:00,268 --> 00:37:03,470
slowly killed by
the laws of thermodynamics.

455
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,974
I would love to solve
this problem right now

456
00:37:05,975 --> 00:37:08,809
but unfortunately...

457
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,614
<i>my balls are frozen.</i>

458
00:37:13,248 --> 00:37:15,283
I can't. I'm calling it. I'm calling it.

459
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,564
<i>Good news, I may have a solution</i>

460
00:37:29,565 --> 00:37:31,298
<i>to my heating problem.</i>

461
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:33,635
<i>Bad news, it involves me digging up</i>

462
00:37:33,636 --> 00:37:36,437
<i>the Radioisotope
Thermoelectric Generator.</i>

463
00:37:36,438 --> 00:37:38,640
<i>Now, if I remember my
training correctly,</i>

464
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:40,707
<i>one of the lessons was titled...</i>

465
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:44,077
<i>"Don't Dig Up the Big
Box of Plutonium, Mark."</i>

466
00:37:44,078 --> 00:37:46,113
<i>I get it. RTGs are good for spacecraft,</i>

467
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:47,948
<i>but if they rupture around humans...</i>

468
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:49,383
<i>no more humans.</i>

469
00:37:49,384 --> 00:37:51,252
<i>Which is why we buried
it when we arrived.</i>

470
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,220
<i>And planted that flag...</i>

471
00:37:53,221 --> 00:37:54,588
<i>so we would never be stupid enough</i>

472
00:37:54,589 --> 00:37:57,091
<i>to accidentally go near it again.</i>

473
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,961
<i>But as long as I don't break it...</i>

474
00:37:59,962 --> 00:38:01,296
<i>I almost just said</i>

475
00:38:01,297 --> 00:38:03,363
<i>"Everything will be fine" out loud.</i>

476
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:05,332
Look, the point is, I'm not cold anymore.

477
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:06,966
And sure, I could choose to think

478
00:38:06,967 --> 00:38:08,369
about the fact that I'm warm...

479
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,405
because I have a decaying

480
00:38:10,406 --> 00:38:12,439
radioactive isotope
riding right behind me...

481
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,209
but right now, I got
bigger problems on my hands.

482
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,611
<i>I have scoured every single data file</i>

483
00:38:17,612 --> 00:38:19,847
<i>on Commander Lewis' personal drive.</i>

484
00:38:19,848 --> 00:38:24,318
<i>This is officially the

<i>♪ Lookin' for some hot stuff</i>

<i>♪ I need hot stuff ♪</i>

494
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:00,687
- Yeah.
- Where is Watney going?

495
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:03,157
We believe that he's
preparing for a journey.

496
00:39:03,158 --> 00:39:05,358
He's been conducting incremental tests...

497
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,861
taking the <i>Rover 2</i> out for longer

498
00:39:06,862 --> 00:39:08,729
and longer trips each time.

499
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,066
To what end? Why would he leave

500
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,601
the relative safety of the Hab?

501
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:15,102
Well, we think that he plans to travel

502
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:16,604
to the <i>Ares 4</i> launch site...

503
00:39:16,605 --> 00:39:18,106
in order to make contact with us,

504
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:19,907
but it would be a dangerous gamble.

505
00:39:19,908 --> 00:39:21,276
<i>But if we could talk to him,</i>

506
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:22,776
<i>we would tell him to stay put...</i>

507
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,211
<i>and to trust that we are
doing everything in our power</i>

508
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:27,314
<i>to bring him home alive.</i>

509
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:29,417
Thank you very much.

510
00:39:31,752 --> 00:39:34,055
Don't say "Bring him home alive," Vincent.

511
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:36,289
You know what? These
interviews aren't easy.

512
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:37,892
So God forbid I try to say something

513
00:39:37,893 --> 00:39:39,561
proactive and positive.

514
00:39:39,562 --> 00:39:40,729
Annie.

515
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:43,463
No more Vincent on TV. Copy that.

516
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:46,834
76 kilometers. Am I reading that right?

517
00:39:46,835 --> 00:39:48,169
Are you asking me?

518
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,204
I am.

519
00:39:49,205 --> 00:39:50,738
Yes, sir.

520
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:53,840
Mark drove two hours
straightaway from the Hab...

521
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:56,044
did a short EVA and then
drove for another two.

522
00:39:56,045 --> 00:39:58,745
We think the EVA was to change batteries.

523
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:00,081
He didn't load up the oxygenator

524
00:40:00,082 --> 00:40:01,682
or the water reclaimer?

525
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:04,517
Every 41 hours, there's a 17 minute gap.

526
00:40:04,518 --> 00:40:06,619
It's just the way the orbits work...

527
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:09,657
so it's possible that we missed something.

528
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,392
I want that gap down to four minutes.

529
00:40:11,393 --> 00:40:13,427
I'm giving you total authority

530
00:40:13,428 --> 00:40:15,597
over satellite trajectories
and orbital adjustments.

531
00:40:15,598 --> 00:40:16,831
Make it happen.

532
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:18,332
Okay.

533
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,269
Let's assume Miss Park
didn't miss anything.

534
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,637
So Mark's not going to <i>Ares 4.</i> Yet.

535
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:26,006
But he's smart enough to figure out

536
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,443
that's his only chance.

537
00:40:28,444 --> 00:40:31,278
Bruce, what's the earliest
we can get a pre-supply there?

538
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:33,481
<i>With the positions of Earth and Mars,</i>

539
00:40:33,482 --> 00:40:35,817
<i>it'll take nine months.</i>

540
00:40:36,652 --> 00:40:38,686
<i>It'll take six months to
build it in the first place.</i>

541
00:40:38,687 --> 00:40:40,119
Three months.

542
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,622
Three?

543
00:40:41,623 --> 00:40:42,756
<i>You're going
to say it's impossible</i>

544
00:40:42,757 --> 00:40:44,390
<i>and then I'm gonna make a speech...</i>

545
00:40:44,391 --> 00:40:45,392
<i>about the blinding capabilities</i>

546
00:40:45,393 --> 00:40:46,794
<i>of the JPL team...</i>

547
00:40:46,795 --> 00:40:47,961
<i>and then you're going to do the math</i>

548
00:40:47,962 --> 00:40:49,296
<i>in your head and say something like...</i>

549
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:51,365
"The overtime alone will be a nightmare."

550
00:40:51,366 --> 00:40:53,233
<i>The overtime alone will be a nightmare.</i>

551
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:54,434
Get started.

552
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:56,238
I'll find you the money.

553
00:40:57,105 --> 00:40:59,173
We need to tell the crew.

554
00:40:59,174 --> 00:41:00,073
Mitch, we've discussed this.

555
00:41:00,074 --> 00:41:01,876
No, you discussed this.

556
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:05,279
I'm the one who decides
what's best for the crew.

557
00:41:06,281 --> 00:41:08,016
They deserve to know.

558
00:41:09,417 --> 00:41:11,151
Once there's a real rescue
plan, we'll tell them.

559
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:13,021
Otherwise, it's moot.

560
00:41:13,022 --> 00:41:15,622
Bruce has three months
to get the payload done.

561
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:17,358
That's all that matters right now.

562
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,160
<i>We'll do our best.</i>

563
00:41:19,161 --> 00:41:21,997
Mark dies if you don't.

564
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:27,133
<i>It's been 48 sols
since I planted the potatoes.</i>

565
00:41:27,134 --> 00:41:29,336
<i>So now it's time to reap and re-sow.</i>

566
00:41:29,337 --> 00:41:31,972
<i>They grew even better than I expected.</i>

567
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:35,175
<i>I now have 400 healthy potato plants.</i>

568
00:41:35,176 --> 00:41:38,345
<i>I dug them up, being careful
to leave their plants alive.</i>

569
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:39,948
<i>The smaller ones I'll reseed,</i>

570
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:42,416
<i>the larger ones are my food supply.</i>

571
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:46,320
<i>All natural, organic,
Martian-grown potatoes.</i>

572
00:41:46,321 --> 00:41:49,356
<i>You don't hear that every day, do you?</i>

573
00:41:49,357 --> 00:41:51,157
<i>And by the way, none of
this matters at all...</i>

574
00:41:51,158 --> 00:41:54,495
<i>if I can't figure out a way
to make contact with NASA.</i>

575
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:17,452
<i>I know what I'm gonna do.</i>

576
00:42:45,848 --> 00:42:47,146
Oh! He's moving again.

577
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,751
Where the hell is he going?

578
00:42:49,752 --> 00:42:52,086
He hasn't changed course for 13 days.

579
00:42:52,087 --> 00:42:54,555
He's nowhere near the <i>Ares 4.</i>

580
00:42:54,556 --> 00:42:56,523
Unless he's not taking a direct route.

581
00:42:56,524 --> 00:43:00,461
He might be trying to avoid some obstacle.

582
00:43:00,462 --> 00:43:02,262
What obstacle?

583
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:03,765
It's Acidalia Planitia.

584
00:43:03,766 --> 00:43:05,734
There's nothing out there except the...

585
00:43:07,937 --> 00:43:09,571
What?

586
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,042
I need a map.

587
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,716
Yeah.

588
00:43:22,717 --> 00:43:24,184
Hey, come on. What are you doing?

589
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,218
It's all right. It's all right.

590
00:43:25,219 --> 00:43:26,687
Can I borrow this?

591
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:28,789
Okay, so where is the Hab location?

592
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,459
31.2 degrees north, 28.5 degrees west.

593
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,693
Okay. Mmm-hmm.

594
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,794
- Where's Watney?
- Uh...

595
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:35,963
There.

596
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:37,465
Okay.

597
00:43:43,337 --> 00:43:46,472
Okay. I know where he's going.

598
00:43:46,473 --> 00:43:48,409
I need to get on an airplane.

599
00:44:20,609 --> 00:44:21,976
Vincent, how are you?

600
00:44:21,977 --> 00:44:23,311
Good to see you.

601
00:44:23,312 --> 00:44:24,778
- Good flight?
- Uh...

602
00:44:24,779 --> 00:44:26,280
Yeah.

603
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:29,584
It's in storage just around the corner.

604
00:45:03,618 --> 00:45:04,952
Hey, Vincent, nice to see you again.

605
00:45:04,953 --> 00:45:06,287
Nice to see you.

606
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:08,655
What are the chances Mark
can get it working again?

607
00:45:08,656 --> 00:45:12,392
It's hard to say. We lost contact in '97.

608
00:45:12,393 --> 00:45:14,628
We think it was battery failure.

609
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:15,896
Though I'd like to point out

610
00:45:15,897 --> 00:45:18,633
it lasted three times longer
than expected in any...

611
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:19,932
Nobody's criticizing JPL's work, Bruce.

612
00:45:19,933 --> 00:45:21,068
I just need to speak to everybody

613
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:22,202
that was here in '97.

614
00:45:22,203 --> 00:45:24,003
They're already here. Guys.

615
00:45:24,004 --> 00:45:25,606
I'd like to introduce Vincent Kapoor.

616
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:27,441
Director of Mars Missions for NASA.

617
00:45:27,442 --> 00:45:28,743
This is our current team...

618
00:45:29,344 --> 00:45:31,745
and our original project members.

619
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,229
- Is this the replica?
- This is her.

620
00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:51,532
Okay. Let's see it.

621
00:45:51,533 --> 00:45:53,468
<i>Pathfinder.</i>

622
00:45:58,473 --> 00:46:00,475
<i>Pathfinder.</i>

623
00:47:10,712 --> 00:47:13,281
Come on. Come on.

624
00:47:33,335 --> 00:47:35,703
Holy shit. Okay.

625
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:37,671
"Broadcasting status.

626
00:47:37,672 --> 00:47:38,939
"Listening for telemetry signal."

627
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:40,475
Uh-huh.

628
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:43,211
Okay. Signal acquired.

629
00:47:44,478 --> 00:47:45,479
- All right.
- Okay.

630
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,249
Camera.

631
00:48:36,631 --> 00:48:38,433
Incoming.

632
00:48:40,301 --> 00:48:43,738
"Are you receiving me?"

633
00:48:43,739 --> 00:48:46,273
"Yes. No."

634
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:50,343
Okay, point the camera at "yes."

635
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,046
32-minute round-trip
communications time.

636
00:48:53,047 --> 00:48:54,581
All he can do is ask yes or no questions...

637
00:48:54,582 --> 00:48:56,716
and all we can do is point the camera.

638
00:48:56,717 --> 00:48:57,885
This won't exactly be
an Algonquin Round Table

639
00:48:57,886 --> 00:48:59,220
of snappy repartee.

640
00:48:59,221 --> 00:49:01,120
- Are you kidding me?
- Tim, Tim.

641
00:49:01,121 --> 00:49:03,356
- Just point the camera.
- Roger that.

642
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,926
Pointing the camera.

643
00:49:16,737 --> 00:49:18,406
Whoo!

644
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:21,675
Yes!

645
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:24,111
Yes!

646
00:49:25,346 --> 00:49:27,715
<i>So here's the rub.</i>

647
00:49:27,716 --> 00:49:30,151
<i>Somehow we have to have complex</i>

648
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:31,792
<i>astrophysical engineering
conversations...</i>

649
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:36,823
<i>using nothing but a
still-frame camera...</i>

650
00:49:36,824 --> 00:49:38,959
<i>from 1996.</i>

651
00:49:41,663 --> 00:49:43,631
<i>Luckily...</i>

652
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:47,466
<i>the camera does spin.</i>

653
00:49:47,467 --> 00:49:49,736
So I can make an alphabet.

654
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:51,671
It can't be our alphabet.

655
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:54,175
26 characters plus a question card

656
00:49:54,176 --> 00:49:56,644
into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc.

657
00:49:56,645 --> 00:49:58,244
That's way too narrow.

658
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,115
I'd never know what the
camera was pointing at.

659
00:50:07,355 --> 00:50:08,990
Ooh.

660
00:50:13,228 --> 00:50:14,796
Hexadecimals.

661
00:50:18,866 --> 00:50:20,867
Hexadecimals to the rescue.

662
00:50:20,868 --> 00:50:22,302
<i>I figured one of you guys</i>

663
00:50:22,303 --> 00:50:24,537
<i>kept an ASCII table lying around.</i>

664
00:50:24,538 --> 00:50:25,838
<i>And I was right.</i>

665
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:27,140
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

666
00:50:27,141 --> 00:50:30,711
<i>I give you super-nerd Beth Johanssen.</i>

667
00:50:30,712 --> 00:50:33,747
<i>Who also had copies of</i> Zork II...

668
00:50:33,748 --> 00:50:36,550
<i>and</i> Leather Goddesses of
Phobos <i>on her personal laptop.</i>

669
00:50:37,819 --> 00:50:39,486
<i>Seriously, Johanssen...</i>

670
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,256
it's like the Smithsonian
of loneliness on there.

671
00:50:42,257 --> 00:50:44,358
- <i>Not that I'm complaining.</i>
- Yes!

672
00:50:44,359 --> 00:50:46,761
<i>Who am I to talk about loneliness?</i>

673
00:51:06,614 --> 00:51:09,049
I know where he's going with this.

674
00:51:56,698 --> 00:51:58,898
"F, O."

675
00:51:58,899 --> 00:52:01,101
"7, W."

676
00:52:18,486 --> 00:52:19,653
Vincent.

677
00:52:19,654 --> 00:52:21,722
Vincent, wake up.

678
00:52:33,868 --> 00:52:36,869
<i>Now that we can have more
complicated conversations...</i>

679
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:39,139
<i>the smart people at NASA
have sent me instructions</i>

680
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,874
<i>on how to hack the Rover...</i>

681
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:43,142
<i>so that it can talk to</i> Pathfinder.

682
00:52:43,143 --> 00:52:45,311
<i>If I hack a tiny bit of code...</i>

683
00:52:45,312 --> 00:52:48,548
<i>just 20 instructions in the
Rover's operating system...</i>

684
00:52:48,549 --> 00:52:50,084
<i>NASA can link the Rover to</i> Pathfinder's

685
00:52:50,085 --> 00:52:52,084
<i>broadcasting frequency...</i>

686
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,888
<i>and we're in business.</i>

687
00:53:07,669 --> 00:53:09,135
"Mark...

688
00:53:09,136 --> 00:53:11,972
"this is Vincent Kapoor.

<i>"The whole world is rooting for you.</i>

00:53:19,547 --> 00:53:23,050
<i>"Amazing job getting</i> Pathfinder.

<i>"We're working on rescue plans.</i>

<i>"Meantime, we're putting

694
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:33,794
"to keep you fed until <i>Ares 4</i> arrives."

695
00:53:50,277 --> 00:53:51,812
Okay.

696
00:54:01,288 --> 00:54:02,756
Okay.

697
00:54:03,424 --> 00:54:05,659
"Glad to hear it. Really
looking forward to not dying."

698
00:54:17,871 --> 00:54:19,673
"How's the crew?"

699
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:22,644
"What did they say when
they found out I was alive?"

700
00:54:43,297 --> 00:54:45,731
Guys, can we get some space please?

701
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:46,800
Me?

702
00:54:46,801 --> 00:54:48,135
Yeah, you.

703
00:54:48,136 --> 00:54:49,937
Give me a sec.

704
00:54:55,877 --> 00:54:57,879
Just tell him.

705
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:12,459
"We haven't told the
crew you are alive yet.

706
00:55:14,094 --> 00:55:18,466
"We need them to concentrate
on their mission."

707
00:55:30,779 --> 00:55:33,448
What the fuck?

708
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:35,383
What the fuck?

709
00:55:42,424 --> 00:55:45,157
Okay, he says, "They don't know I'm alive?

710
00:55:45,158 --> 00:55:47,126
"What the..." F-word.

711
00:55:47,127 --> 00:55:48,494
F-word in gerund form.

712
00:55:48,495 --> 00:55:50,097
F-word, again, "is wrong with you?"

713
00:55:52,634 --> 00:55:56,236
"Mark, please watch your language.

714
00:55:56,237 --> 00:55:58,405
"Everything you type

715
00:55:58,406 --> 00:56:02,944
"is being broadcast
live all over the world."

716
00:56:04,978 --> 00:56:06,481
Yeah?

717
00:56:14,489 --> 00:56:15,655
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

718
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:19,659
Yes, sir.

719
00:56:19,660 --> 00:56:21,962
He is under a tremendous amount of stress.

720
00:56:23,098 --> 00:56:24,658
I understand. We're working on it.

721
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:26,932
I'm sure he didn't mean what he said.

722
00:56:26,933 --> 00:56:28,869
Thank you, Mr. President.

723
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:31,738
Problem is, Mark's right.

724
00:56:31,739 --> 00:56:34,106
The longer we wait, the
worse it's gonna get.

725
00:56:34,107 --> 00:56:35,675
We need to tell the crew.

726
00:56:35,676 --> 00:56:38,343
You're bringing this up while
Vincent is in Pasadena...

727
00:56:38,344 --> 00:56:40,079
so he can't argue the other side.

728
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,615
I shouldn't have to answer to Vincent.

729
00:56:41,616 --> 00:56:43,551
Or anyone else.

730
00:56:45,286 --> 00:56:47,321
It's time, Teddy.

731
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,579
<i>Commander Lewis?</i>

732
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:14,048
Go ahead.

733
00:57:14,614 --> 00:57:16,483
<i>Data dump is almost complete.</i>

734
00:57:17,317 --> 00:57:19,586
Copy that. On my way.

735
00:57:32,165 --> 00:57:33,666
You're in a hurry.

736
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,169
Yeah.

737
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:37,204
My son turned three yesterday.

738
00:57:37,205 --> 00:57:39,339
Should be pictures of the party.

739
00:57:49,516 --> 00:57:51,517
Got a batch of personals.

740
00:57:51,518 --> 00:57:54,055
Dispatching them to your laptops now.

741
00:57:54,989 --> 00:57:58,291
I don't need to read Vogel's
weird German fetish emails.

742
00:57:58,292 --> 00:58:00,293
They're telemetry updates.

743
00:58:00,294 --> 00:58:01,894
Hey, whatever does it for you, man.

744
00:58:02,964 --> 00:58:04,430
There's a video message.

745
00:58:04,431 --> 00:58:06,566
It's addressed to the whole crew.

746
00:58:06,567 --> 00:58:09,302
Play it. Come on, guys.

747
00:58:09,303 --> 00:58:10,970
I wanna get in on
that telemetry action.

748
00:58:14,875 --> 00:58:18,111
<i>Hi, hello. It's Mitch. Mitch Henderson.</i>

749
00:58:18,112 --> 00:58:20,280
<i>I have some news.</i>

750
00:58:20,281 --> 00:58:23,550
<i>There's no subtle way to put this.</i>

751
00:58:23,551 --> 00:58:25,619
<i>Mark Watney is still alive.</i>

752
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,653
Oh, my God.

753
00:58:27,654 --> 00:58:29,889
<i>I know that's a surprise and I know</i>

754
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:31,423
<i>you will have a lot of questions.</i>

755
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:34,394
<i>But here are the basics.</i>

756
00:58:34,395 --> 00:58:37,231
<i>He's alive and he's healthy.</i>

757
00:58:38,699 --> 00:58:42,468
<i>We found out two months ago
and decided not to tell you.</i>

758
00:58:42,469 --> 00:58:43,936
- Two months?
- Oh, my God.

759
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:46,773
<i>I was strongly
against that decision.</i>

760
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:49,776
<i>We're telling you now because...</i>

761
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:52,445
<i>we finally have
communication with him...</i>

762
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:55,581
<i>and a viable rescue plan.</i>

763
00:58:55,582 --> 00:58:57,617
<i>We'll give you a write-up
of what happened,</i>

764
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:59,184
<i>a full write-up of everything.</i>

765
00:58:59,185 --> 00:59:00,887
<i>But it's not your fault.</i>

766
00:59:00,888 --> 00:59:03,957
<i>Mark stresses that
every time it comes up.</i>

767
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:07,394
<i>So... Yeah...</i>

768
00:59:09,062 --> 00:59:11,597
<i>Take some time to absorb this.</i>

769
00:59:11,598 --> 00:59:14,300
<i>And send all the questions you want.</i>

770
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,203
<i>We'll answer them.</i>

771
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:19,206
<i>All right. Henderson out.</i>

772
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:21,308
Holy shit, he's alive.

773
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:23,276
I left him behind.

774
00:59:23,277 --> 00:59:24,311
- No.
- No.

775
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:26,146
We all left together.

776
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:28,281
You were following orders.

777
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:34,020
I left him behind.

778
00:59:43,464 --> 00:59:44,363
<i>So now that
NASA can talk to me,</i>

779
00:59:44,364 --> 00:59:46,166
<i>they won't shut up.</i>

780
00:59:46,167 --> 00:59:48,936
<i>They want constant updates
on every Hab system...</i>

781
00:59:48,937 --> 00:59:50,669
<i>and they got a room full of people</i>

782
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,639
<i>trying to micromanage my crops.</i>

783
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,575
<i>Which is awesome.</i>

784
00:59:55,275 --> 00:59:57,544
<i>Look, I don't mean to sound
arrogant or anything...</i>

785
00:59:57,545 --> 01:00:02,383
<i>but I am the greatest
botanist on this planet, so...</i>

786
01:00:03,384 --> 01:00:04,885
<i>One big bonus</i>

787
01:00:04,886 --> 01:00:06,887
<i>to this communication
with NASA again...</i>

788
01:00:06,888 --> 01:00:08,521
<i>is the email. I'm getting them again.</i>

789
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:10,890
<i>Big data dumps like when
I was on the</i> Hermes.

790
01:00:10,891 --> 01:00:12,959
<i>I even got one from the president.</i>

791
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,628
<i>The coolest one, though,
the coolest one I got...</i>

792
01:00:15,629 --> 01:00:16,863
<i>was from University of Chicago,</i>

793
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:18,631
<i>my alma mater.</i>

794
01:00:18,632 --> 01:00:21,300
They say that once you
grow crops somewhere...

795
01:00:21,301 --> 01:00:23,503
you've officially colonized it.

796
01:00:24,004 --> 01:00:26,607
<i>So, technically...</i>

797
01:00:27,274 --> 01:00:29,175
<i>I colonized Mars.</i>

798
01:00:33,614 --> 01:00:36,083
In your face, Neil Armstrong.

799
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:38,517
In other news, there's been a request...

800
01:00:38,518 --> 01:00:40,253
for me to pose for a photograph

801
01:00:40,254 --> 01:00:42,622
on my next transmission.

802
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,590
I'm trying to figure out whether

803
01:00:44,591 --> 01:00:47,459
I should go with "High School Senior"...

804
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:50,765
or "coquettish ingenue."

805
01:00:52,466 --> 01:00:53,867
But I'm not really sure

806
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:55,788
how that's gonna look with my spacesuit on.

807
01:01:21,395 --> 01:01:23,130
Hey!

808
01:01:25,165 --> 01:01:26,932
What is he doing?

809
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:29,202
I asked for a photo,
and what, he's The Fonz?

810
01:01:29,203 --> 01:01:31,003
<i>Just be grateful we got
you something, Annie.</i>

811
01:01:31,004 --> 01:01:33,173
I can't use this,
Vincent, and you know that.

812
01:01:33,174 --> 01:01:34,673
I need a picture of his face.

813
01:01:34,674 --> 01:01:36,409
<i>I could tell him to
take off his helmet...</i>

814
01:01:36,410 --> 01:01:37,977
but then he'd, you know, die, so...

815
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:40,680
<i>We'll release the photo</i>

816
01:01:40,681 --> 01:01:41,981
<i>when we detail the rescue operation.</i>

817
01:01:41,982 --> 01:01:43,816
I want to announce we're launching

818
01:01:43,817 --> 01:01:45,117
some supplies to him next year...

819
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:47,320
during the Hohmann Transfer Window.

820
01:01:47,321 --> 01:01:49,689
Bruce, your team's still on schedule?

821
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:51,624
<i>It'll be tight, but we'll make it.</i>

822
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:53,526
Nine-month travel time.

823
01:01:53,527 --> 01:01:55,994
That puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868.

824
01:01:55,995 --> 01:01:58,097
Did we get the botany team's analysis?

825
01:01:58,098 --> 01:02:01,602
<i>Yeah, they estimate Mark's
crops will last till Sol 912.</i>

826
01:02:01,603 --> 01:02:04,137
<i>They grudgingly admit that
he's doing great work.</i>

827
01:02:04,138 --> 01:02:05,470
Grudgingly?

828
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,506
<i>Yeah. Mark has a tendency to tell them</i>

829
01:02:06,507 --> 01:02:07,740
<i>to have sex with themselves...</i>

830
01:02:07,741 --> 01:02:09,709
<i>whenever they question
one of his decisions.</i>

831
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:10,811
Get him in line, Vincent.

832
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:12,711
We can't afford any miscommunication.

833
01:02:12,712 --> 01:02:14,381
I hate this margin.

834
01:02:14,382 --> 01:02:18,285
912 Sols worth of food.
We get there on 868.

835
01:02:18,852 --> 01:02:21,589
And that's assuming nothing goes wrong.

836
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:09,168
<i>Suit breach detected.</i>

837
01:03:16,777 --> 01:03:19,712
<i>Oxygen level critical.</i>

838
01:03:32,792 --> 01:03:35,929
<i>Oxygen level, 10%.</i>

839
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:53,279
<i>Oxygen level, 5%.</i>

840
01:04:02,355 --> 01:04:04,557
<i>Suit pressure, stable.</i>

841
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:02,542
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

842
01:06:35,676 --> 01:06:38,979
God! God, God, God, God!

843
01:06:57,498 --> 01:06:59,631
Crops are dead.

844
01:06:59,632 --> 01:07:01,966
Complete loss of pressure
boiled off most of the water.

845
01:07:01,967 --> 01:07:03,369
Any bacteria that survived,

846
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:05,171
died in the subzero temperatures...

847
01:07:05,172 --> 01:07:07,106
when exposed to Mars' atmosphere.

848
01:07:07,107 --> 01:07:08,975
How long does he have?

849
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:11,910
He can still
eat the potatoes he has,

850
01:07:11,911 --> 01:07:14,380
he just can't grow any more...

851
01:07:14,381 --> 01:07:17,117
so give him 200 sols.

852
01:07:17,118 --> 01:07:20,253
Rations get him to what? Sol 409?

853
01:07:20,254 --> 01:07:23,222
Mmm-hmm. So with potatoes, 609.

854
01:07:23,223 --> 01:07:26,126
So by Sol 868, he'll be long dead.

855
01:07:26,127 --> 01:07:27,959
We're gonna have to launch
as soon as possible...

856
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,729
which changes our travel time.

857
01:07:30,797 --> 01:07:32,698
Yeah, we're working on it.

858
01:07:33,366 --> 01:07:37,836
Prelim estimates call for a 414-day trip.

859
01:07:37,837 --> 01:07:40,240
It's Sol 135 now.

860
01:07:40,241 --> 01:07:42,407
We need 13 days to mount the boosters,

861
01:07:42,408 --> 01:07:43,843
perform inspections...

862
01:07:43,844 --> 01:07:47,146
which gives Bruce and his team...

863
01:07:47,147 --> 01:07:49,850
47 days to make this probe.

864
01:07:50,951 --> 01:07:54,488
I'll let you call Bruce, give him the news.

865
01:07:56,824 --> 01:07:58,759
Okay.

866
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:04,664
I'm gonna need a change of clothes.

867
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:15,108
<i>"Dear Mark...</i>

868
01:08:15,109 --> 01:08:19,913

us talk to you now.</i>

01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,750

Oh, Jesus.

01:09:28,215 --> 01:09:30,849
"and look at the vast horizons."

888
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:32,585

889
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:35,254
"Just because I can.

890
01:09:35,255 --> 01:09:38,625
"Tell the others I said hello."

891
01:09:40,795 --> 01:09:42,696
"Will do, buddy."

892
01:11:12,318 --> 01:11:14,253
<i>Pressure stable.</i>

893
01:11:53,693 --> 01:11:56,594

895
01:12:00,766 --> 01:12:02,668

896

897
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:34,301
Rich.

898
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:36,101
Rich.

899
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:37,803
Wake up.

900
01:12:40,373 --> 01:12:42,509
Sorry, but they're asking
for the probe courses.

901
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:44,009
What time is it?

902
01:12:44,010 --> 01:12:46,345
It's 3:42.

903
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:54,119
Look, I know we're coming
at this backwards...

904
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,821
but we can't commit to a firm launch date

905
01:12:55,822 --> 01:12:57,758
with this many unknowns.

906
01:12:58,224 --> 01:13:00,459
It's all right. Um...

907
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,295
All 25 models for launch will
take 414 days to reach Mars.

908
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,098
They vary slightly in thrust duration...

909
01:13:05,099 --> 01:13:07,067
and the fuel requirement
is nearly identical.

910
01:13:08,135 --> 01:13:10,269
Not a good time to launch, is it?

911
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:13,205
Yeah, Earth and Mars are
really badly positioned.

912
01:13:13,206 --> 01:13:15,375
Heck, it'd almost be easier if you...

913
01:13:17,911 --> 01:13:19,379
Almost easier to what?

914
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:22,048
I need more coffee.

915
01:13:22,049 --> 01:13:23,781
Ahh!

916
01:13:23,782 --> 01:13:24,817
Are you all right?

917
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:26,253
It's fine.

918
01:13:30,157 --> 01:13:32,359
Almost easier to what?

919
01:13:43,569 --> 01:13:46,006
You do understand I'm your boss, right?

920
01:13:46,572 --> 01:13:48,007
Uh-huh.

921
01:13:51,211 --> 01:13:52,577
All right, let's ask

922
01:13:52,578 --> 01:13:55,281
the very, very expensive question.

923
01:13:55,748 --> 01:13:57,549
Is the probe going to be ready on time?

924
01:13:57,550 --> 01:13:59,485
<i>- We're behind.</i>
- Give me a number.

925
01:13:59,486 --> 01:14:02,988
<i>15 days. 15 days and I can get it done.</i>

926
01:14:02,989 --> 01:14:04,188
All right, let's create 15 days.

927
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:05,857
13 days to mount the probe.

928
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,526
Can we reduce?

929
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,661
It actually only takes three
days to mount the probe.

930
01:14:09,662 --> 01:14:11,563
And we can get that down to two, right?

931
01:14:11,564 --> 01:14:13,299
<i>I can get it down to two.</i>

932
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:15,000
10 days are for tests and inspections.

933
01:14:15,001 --> 01:14:17,903
How often do those
inspections reveal a problem?

934
01:14:18,906 --> 01:14:20,705
Are you suggesting we
don't do the inspections?

935
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:22,875
Right now I'm asking how
often they reveal a problem.

936
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:24,242
One in 20.

937
01:14:24,243 --> 01:14:25,878
But that's grounds for countdown halt.

938
01:14:25,879 --> 01:14:27,345
We can't take that chance.

939
01:14:27,346 --> 01:14:29,915
Anyone else know a safer
way to buy more time?

940
01:14:34,019 --> 01:14:36,621
Dr. Keller, stretch Watney's
rations four more days.

941
01:14:36,622 --> 01:14:38,290
You're not gonna like it,
but that'll get us to 15.

942
01:14:38,291 --> 01:14:39,090
And we'll cancel the inspections.

943
01:14:39,091 --> 01:14:40,558
Teddy.

944
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,428
- Sir, if that ever got out...
- It's on me.

945
01:14:42,429 --> 01:14:43,829
You got your two weeks.

946
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,432
Get it done.

947
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:48,466
So, now I have to hold out

948
01:14:48,467 --> 01:14:50,568
until the probe gets here with more food.

949
01:14:50,569 --> 01:14:53,205
You want to see what minimal
calorie count looks like?

950
01:14:53,206 --> 01:14:55,006
Standard issue ration.

951
01:14:55,007 --> 01:14:59,277
But instead of three of
these every one day...

952
01:14:59,278 --> 01:15:03,082
I'm now eating one of
these every three days.

953
01:15:04,317 --> 01:15:06,453
And now, they've asked me...

954
01:15:07,019 --> 01:15:08,622
to do that.

955
01:15:13,059 --> 01:15:14,628
The point is...

956
01:15:15,862 --> 01:15:19,199
<i>"stretch the rations four more days"...</i>

957
01:15:19,966 --> 01:15:22,101
<i>is a real dick-punch.</i>

958
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:28,909
<i>I'm gonna dip this potato
in some crushed Vicodin.</i>

959
01:15:30,477 --> 01:15:32,512
And there's nobody who can stop me.

960
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:46,092
<i>It has been seven days
since I ran out of ketchup.</i>

961
01:15:57,738 --> 01:16:00,272
Up. Up, up. Yeah.

962
01:16:00,273 --> 01:16:02,407
Let's go up here.

963
01:16:02,408 --> 01:16:04,008
Labels facing up.

964
01:16:08,881 --> 01:16:10,182

01:16:10,183 --> 01:16:12,050
Begin launch status check.

966
01:16:12,051 --> 01:16:14,754
Roger that, Flight.
Beginning launch status check.

967
01:16:14,755 --> 01:16:17,123
Do you believe in God, Vincent?

968
01:16:17,890 --> 01:16:19,391
Yeah.

969
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,794
Yeah, my father was a Hindu,

970
01:16:21,795 --> 01:16:24,263
my mother's a Baptist, so, yeah...

971
01:16:24,264 --> 01:16:26,299
I believe in several.

972
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,835
We'll take all the help we can get.

973
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,470
<i>Launch status check complete.</i>

974
01:16:32,471 --> 01:16:34,106
This is Flight.

975
01:16:34,107 --> 01:16:35,840
We are go for launch.

976
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:36,909
<i>Proceeding with the count.</i>

977
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:38,376

<i>Good thrust.</i>

986
01:16:57,229 --> 01:16:59,064
<i>Performance is nominal.</i>

987

<i>The tail

988
01:17:16,282 --> 01:17:17,817
<i>She's rock
solid at this point, Flight.</i>

989
01:17:17,818 --> 01:17:19,018
<i>TVCs look good.</i>

990
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,283
We're getting a little shimmy, Flight.

991
01:17:32,832 --> 01:17:34,732
Say again?

992
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:37,001
We are getting a very large precession.

993
01:17:37,002 --> 01:17:38,471
Are we good?

994
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,139
<i>Flight,
it's hitting the redline.</i>

995
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:43,743
It's spinning on the long axis
around a 17-degree precession.

996
01:17:45,077 --> 01:17:46,545
Launch, what's happening?

997
01:17:46,546 --> 01:17:48,847
Force on Iris is 7 G's.

998
01:17:48,848 --> 01:17:51,368
We've lost
readings on the probe, Flight.

999
01:17:54,153 --> 01:17:57,390
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1000
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:02,127
We've lost it, Flight.

<i>The thrust of the launch combined</i>

<i>in the inspections phase?</i>

1039
01:20:36,483 --> 01:20:38,082
<i>In order to make our launch window,</i>

1040
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:40,619
<i>we were forced to

1041
01:20:41,741 --> 01:20:45,165
Their astronaut is going to die.

1042
01:20:45,658 --> 01:20:48,486
Of course there are other ways...

1043
01:20:49,184 --> 01:20:52,553
...the Taiyang Shen booster.
Our engineers have run the numbers,

1044
01:20:53,115 --> 01:20:56,021
and it has enough fuel for
a Mars injection orbit.

1045
01:20:56,758 --> 01:20:58,403
Why hasn't NASA approached us?

1046
01:20:58,554 --> 01:20:59,690
They don't know.

1047
01:21:00,455 --> 01:21:02,668
Our booster technology is classified.

1048
01:21:05,113 --> 01:21:06,113
So if we do nothing...

1049
01:21:08,753 --> 01:21:13,703
The world would never
know we could have helped.

1050
01:21:14,303 --> 01:21:16,663
Then, for the sake of argument,

1051
01:21:17,403 --> 01:21:19,638
let's say we decide to help them...

1052
01:21:19,963 --> 01:21:24,656
We'd be giving up a booster and effectively
cancelling Taiyang Shen.

1053
01:21:24,657 --> 01:21:27,696
We need to keep this among scientists,

1054
01:21:28,163 --> 01:21:30,081
a co-operation between space agencies.

1055
01:21:32,337 --> 01:21:33,739
Yes.

1056
01:21:34,773 --> 01:21:36,942
Yes, I understand.

01:21:39,645 --> 01:21:41,446

01:21:48,121 --> 01:21:49,853
Thanks to my uncle Tommy in China,

1061
01:21:49,854 --> 01:21:51,990
we get another chance at this.

1062
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:55,293
Now, we finished the
<i>Iris</i> probe in 62 days.

1063
01:21:55,294 --> 01:21:58,864
We are now gonna attempt
to finish it in 28.

01:22:24,323 --> 01:22:25,622
We can jettison any kind of landing system.

1065
01:22:25,623 --> 01:22:27,058
We're only sending rations.

1066
01:22:27,059 --> 01:22:29,328
We can crash-land on Mars.

1067
01:22:30,162 --> 01:22:32,031
You should hang up the phone.

1068
01:22:32,032 --> 01:22:33,898
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- My name is Rich Purnell.

1069
01:22:33,899 --> 01:22:35,200
I work in Astrodynamics,

1070
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,121
and you should hang up the phone right now.

1071
01:22:38,504 --> 01:22:39,905
All right, all right.

1072
01:22:40,372 --> 01:22:42,040
I'm gonna call you back.

1073
01:22:43,108 --> 01:22:44,876
I know how to save Mark Watney.

1074
01:22:46,078 --> 01:22:48,446
Your probe plan won't work.
Too many things can go wrong.

1075
01:22:48,447 --> 01:22:49,513
I've got a better way.

1076
01:22:49,514 --> 01:22:50,682
Astrodynamics?

1077
01:22:50,683 --> 01:22:52,784
Yeah.

1078
01:22:52,785 --> 01:22:55,687
What the hell is "Project Elrond"?

1079
01:22:55,688 --> 01:22:56,621
I had to make something up.

1080
01:22:56,622 --> 01:22:58,656
But "Elrond"?

1081
01:22:58,657 --> 01:23:00,726
Because it's a secret meeting.

1082
01:23:00,727 --> 01:23:01,994
How do you know that?

1083
01:23:01,995 --> 01:23:03,629
Why does "Elrond" mean "secret meeting"?

1084
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:06,231
<i>The Council of Elrond. It's
from</i> Lord of the Rings.

1085
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:07,332
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

1086
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:08,532
It's the meeting where they decide

1087
01:23:08,533 --> 01:23:09,867
to destroy the One Ring.

1088
01:23:09,868 --> 01:23:11,503
<i>If we're gonna call
something "Project Elrond"...</i>

1089
01:23:11,504 --> 01:23:13,906
I would like my code
name to be "Glorfindel."

1090
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:16,174
Okay, I hate every one of you.

1091
01:23:16,175 --> 01:23:18,509
What, Teddy doesn't
even know about this yet?

1092
01:23:18,510 --> 01:23:19,978
I'm sorry, who are you?

1093
01:23:19,979 --> 01:23:21,939
This is Rich
Purnell, Astrodynamics.

1094
01:23:22,782 --> 01:23:24,415
Tell them what you just told me.

1095
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,787
I can get the <i>Hermes</i>
back to Mars by Sol 561.

1096
01:23:29,189 --> 01:23:30,590
How?

1097
01:23:34,394 --> 01:23:37,463
Could you stand right there for me, please?

1098
01:23:38,531 --> 01:23:39,764
Thanks.

1099
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,267
Right there. Great.

1100
01:23:41,268 --> 01:23:45,671
And could you stand
right there? Right there.

1101
01:23:50,242 --> 01:23:53,778
Okay, let's pretend that this
stapler is the <i>Hermes...</i>

1102
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,281
and you are...

1103
01:23:56,282 --> 01:23:57,816
I'm sorry, what's your name again?

1104
01:23:57,817 --> 01:24:01,586
Teddy. I'm the Director of NASA.

1105
01:24:01,587 --> 01:24:04,055
Cool. Teddy, you're Earth.

1106
01:24:04,056 --> 01:24:06,390
And right now, the <i>Hermes</i>
is headed towards you...

1107
01:24:06,391 --> 01:24:08,861
starting its month-long
deceleration to intercept.

1108
01:24:08,862 --> 01:24:11,330
But instead, what I'm proposing is...

1109
01:24:15,335 --> 01:24:17,768
we start accelerating immediately

1110
01:24:17,769 --> 01:24:19,705
to preserve velocity and gain even more.

1111
01:24:19,706 --> 01:24:20,772
We don't intercept with Earth at all...

1112
01:24:20,773 --> 01:24:22,272
but we come close enough

1113
01:24:22,273 --> 01:24:24,576
to get a gravity assist and adjust course.

1114
01:24:24,577 --> 01:24:26,779
While we're doing that...

1115
01:24:28,613 --> 01:24:30,482
we resupply with the probe...

1116
01:24:30,483 --> 01:24:31,750
The <i>Taiyang Shen.</i>

1117
01:24:31,751 --> 01:24:33,384
...pick up whatever provisions we need...

1118
01:24:33,385 --> 01:24:35,487
and now we're accelerating towards Mars.

1119
01:24:37,889 --> 01:24:39,590
You're Mars.

1120
01:24:39,591 --> 01:24:40,858
Now, we're going too fast

1121
01:24:40,859 --> 01:24:42,626
at this point to fall into orbit...

1122
01:24:42,627 --> 01:24:44,062
but we can do a flyby.

1123
01:24:44,063 --> 01:24:45,263
<i>What good is a flyby</i>

1124
01:24:45,264 --> 01:24:47,264
<i>if we can't get Watney off the surface?</i>

1125
01:24:47,265 --> 01:24:50,134
Watney would intercept using the MAV.

1126
01:24:50,135 --> 01:24:51,671
Ow!

1127
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,774
And then we just head home.

1128
01:25:01,247 --> 01:25:03,950
I've done the math. It checks out.

1129
01:25:05,283 --> 01:25:06,751
<i>- Rich.
- Yes, sir.</i>

1130
01:25:06,752 --> 01:25:07,818
Get out.

1131
01:25:07,819 --> 01:25:09,489
All right.

1132
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:17,429
- Is he right?
- Yeah.

1133
01:25:17,430 --> 01:25:20,031
Bruce, what do you think?

1134
01:25:20,032 --> 01:25:21,900
<i>Well, if Vincent says so.</i>

1135
01:25:23,001 --> 01:25:25,137
We need to use the <i>Taiyang Shen?</i>

1136
01:25:25,138 --> 01:25:26,537
Uh-huh.

1137
01:25:26,538 --> 01:25:28,673
What am I missing? Why is that important?

1138
01:25:28,674 --> 01:25:30,207
Because we can only do one.

1139
01:25:30,208 --> 01:25:32,443
Send Watney enough food to
last till <i>Ares 4...</i>

1140
01:25:32,444 --> 01:25:35,112
or send <i>Hermes</i>
back to get him right now.

1141
01:25:35,113 --> 01:25:36,147
Both plans require the <i>Taiyang Shen,</i>

1142
01:25:36,148 --> 01:25:38,450
so we have to choose.

1143
01:25:38,451 --> 01:25:40,085
But what about the <i>Hermes</i> crew?

1144
01:25:40,086 --> 01:25:41,952
We'd be asking them to add

1145
01:25:41,953 --> 01:25:45,456
533 extra days to their mission.

1146
01:25:45,457 --> 01:25:47,497
Yeah. They wouldn't
hesitate, not for a second.

1147
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:50,094
Can the <i>Hermes</i> function for 533 days

1148
01:25:50,095 --> 01:25:51,296
beyond the scheduled mission end?

1149
01:25:51,297 --> 01:25:52,464
It should.

1150
01:25:52,465 --> 01:25:54,633
Built to last the full <i>Ares</i> mission...

1151
01:25:54,634 --> 01:25:57,235
so technically, it's only
halfway through its lifespan.

1152
01:25:57,236 --> 01:25:58,637
But if something goes wrong...

1153
01:25:58,638 --> 01:26:00,472
Then we lose the crew.

1154
01:26:00,473 --> 01:26:01,973
<i>So what? We
either have a high chance</i>

1155
01:26:01,974 --> 01:26:04,142
<i>of killing one person...</i>

1156
01:26:04,143 --> 01:26:06,745
<i>or a low chance of killing six people.</i>

1157
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:08,146
<i>How do we make that decision?</i>

1158
01:26:08,147 --> 01:26:09,848
We don't have to make it, Bruce.

1159
01:26:09,849 --> 01:26:11,582
He does.

1160
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:13,085
Yeah, well, bullshit.

1161
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:15,086
It should be Commander Lewis' call.

1162
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:16,921
We still have a chance to bring

1163
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,456
five astronauts home safe and sound.

1164
01:26:18,457 --> 01:26:20,560
I'm not risking their lives.

1165
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:23,195
Let them make that decision.

1166
01:26:23,729 --> 01:26:26,698
Mitch, we're going with option one.

1167
01:26:28,067 --> 01:26:30,636
You goddamn coward.

1168
01:26:48,388 --> 01:26:51,356
<i>- Johanssen?
- Yeah.</i>

1169
01:26:51,357 --> 01:26:53,791
I know it's your private time.
Can I bother you for a second?

1170
01:26:53,792 --> 01:26:54,826
<i>Yeah, go ahead.</i>

1171
01:26:54,827 --> 01:26:55,693
<i>Where are you?</i>

1172
01:26:55,694 --> 01:26:57,195
The gym.

1173
01:27:18,617 --> 01:27:20,152
What's up?

1174
01:27:20,153 --> 01:27:21,353
I just got an email from my wife

1175
01:27:21,354 --> 01:27:24,522
and the subject line says, "Our children."

1176
01:27:24,523 --> 01:27:26,892
My computer won't open the attachment.

1177
01:27:27,727 --> 01:27:29,126
Okay.

1178
01:27:29,127 --> 01:27:30,829
Let's take a look.

1179
01:27:34,300 --> 01:27:35,868
Uh...

1180
01:27:36,769 --> 01:27:38,237
Let's see.

1181
01:27:40,104 --> 01:27:42,607
This isn't a JPEG.

1182
01:27:42,608 --> 01:27:45,378
It's a plain ASCII text file.

1183
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,960
I don't really know what we're looking at.

1184
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:52,718
Does that make any sense to you?

1185
01:27:54,653 --> 01:27:57,156
"Rich Purnell Maneuver."

1186
01:27:57,157 --> 01:28:00,125
It's a course maneuver for the <i>Hermes.</i>

1187
01:28:05,398 --> 01:28:07,832
And the mission concludes
with Earth intercept,

1188
01:28:07,833 --> 01:28:09,267
211 days later.

1189
01:28:10,336 --> 01:28:12,370
Would it work?

1190
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:14,305
Mmm-hmm. We ran the
numbers. They check out.

1191
01:28:14,306 --> 01:28:15,941
It's a brilliant course.

1192
01:28:15,942 --> 01:28:19,077
So why all the cloak and dagger?

1193
01:28:19,078 --> 01:28:20,879
Because it goes directly
against NASA's decision.

1194
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:23,048
Yeah. If we do the maneuver,

1195
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:25,250
they'd have to send the
supply ship or we die.

1196
01:28:25,251 --> 01:28:28,788
We have the opportunity
to force their hand.

1197
01:28:29,354 --> 01:28:32,190
So, are we gonna do it?

1198
01:28:33,324 --> 01:28:35,326
If it was up to me, we'd
already be on our way.

1199
01:28:35,327 --> 01:28:37,963
But it is, though, isn't it? Up to you.

1200
01:28:37,964 --> 01:28:39,330
Not this time.

1201
01:28:39,331 --> 01:28:42,468
This is something NASA expressly rejected.

1202
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,036
We're talking about mutiny here,

1203
01:28:45,037 --> 01:28:46,504
which is not a word that I take lightly.

1204
01:28:46,505 --> 01:28:49,374
So we do this together or not at all.

1205
01:28:49,375 --> 01:28:52,509
And before you answer,
consider the consequences.

1206
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:55,613
If we mess up the supply
rendezvous, we die.

1207
01:28:55,614 --> 01:28:58,515
If we mess up the Earth
gravity assist, we die.

1208
01:28:58,516 --> 01:29:01,719
If we do everything perfectly...

1209
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:05,189
we add 533 days to our mission.

1210
01:29:05,190 --> 01:29:09,161
533 more days before we
see our families again.

1211
01:29:09,162 --> 01:29:13,798
533 days of unplanned space travel...

1212
01:29:13,799 --> 01:29:15,433
where anything could go wrong.

1213
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:19,205
If it's mission critical, we die.

1214
01:29:19,639 --> 01:29:20,972
Sign me up.

1215
01:29:20,973 --> 01:29:22,406
All right, cowboy, slow down.

1216
01:29:22,407 --> 01:29:24,543
You and I, we're military.

1217
01:29:24,544 --> 01:29:26,044
Chances are, we go home,
they'll court martial us.

1218
01:29:26,045 --> 01:29:27,245
Yeah, there's that.

1219
01:29:27,246 --> 01:29:28,679
And for the rest of you guys...

1220
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:31,582
I guarantee they will never
send you back up here again.

1221
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:36,153
Good. So, if we go for
it, how would it work?

1222
01:29:36,154 --> 01:29:37,789
I plot the course and execute it.

1223
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:39,290
Remote override.

1224
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,357
They could take over the <i>Hermes</i>

1225
01:29:40,358 --> 01:29:42,093
from Mission Control.

1226
01:29:42,929 --> 01:29:45,263
Can you disable it?

1227
01:29:45,264 --> 01:29:47,432
<i>Hermes</i> has four
redundant flight computers...

1228
01:29:47,433 --> 01:29:49,867
each connected to three
redundant comm systems.

1229
01:29:49,868 --> 01:29:51,202
We can't shut down the comms

1230
01:29:51,203 --> 01:29:52,737
because we'd lose telemetry and guidance.

1231
01:29:52,738 --> 01:29:54,472
And we can't shut down the computers

1232
01:29:54,473 --> 01:29:56,407
because we need to run the ship.

1233
01:29:56,408 --> 01:29:59,878
I'd have to disable remote
override on each system.

1234
01:29:59,879 --> 01:30:01,912
It's part of the OS, I'd
have to jump over the code.

1235
01:30:01,913 --> 01:30:04,883
Okay, but, like, in English,
what would that mean?

1236
01:30:06,251 --> 01:30:08,119
I can do it.

1237
01:30:08,621 --> 01:30:10,156
Great.

1238
01:30:11,424 --> 01:30:13,292
Well, it has to be unanimous.

1239
01:30:13,826 --> 01:30:18,864
If we do this, it'll be
over 900 days of space.

1240
01:30:20,799 --> 01:30:24,835
That's more than enough
space for one life...

1241
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:26,705
so, yes.

1242
01:30:26,706 --> 01:30:28,440
I vote yes.

1243
01:30:30,309 --> 01:30:32,311
Let's go get him.

1244
01:30:34,746 --> 01:30:36,481
Johanssen?

1245
01:30:36,482 --> 01:30:37,948
Yes.

1246
01:30:37,949 --> 01:30:39,116
Yeah!

1247
01:30:41,819 --> 01:30:44,455
Got an unscheduled status
update from <i>Hermes.</i>

1248
01:30:44,456 --> 01:30:45,689
Roger. Read it out.

1249
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:48,559
Message reads, "Houston, please be advised.

1250
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:50,128
"Rich Purnell is a
steely-eyed missile man."

1251
01:30:50,129 --> 01:30:51,528
What?

1252
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,030
Flight, Guidance.

1253
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:55,165
<i>Hermes</i> is off-course.

1254
01:30:55,166 --> 01:30:56,401
CAPCOM, advise <i>Hermes</i> they're drifting.

1255
01:30:56,402 --> 01:30:58,268
Guidance, get a correction ready.

1256
01:30:58,269 --> 01:30:59,269
Negative, Flight,

1257
01:30:59,270 --> 01:31:00,871
it's not drift. They've adjusted course.

1258
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:02,506
What the hell?

1259
01:31:02,507 --> 01:31:05,710
Telemetry, any chance this
is instrumentation failure?

1260
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,445
Negative, Flight.

1261
01:31:07,446 --> 01:31:08,580
Guidance, work at how long they can stay

1262
01:31:08,581 --> 01:31:10,447
on this course before it's irreversible.

1263
01:31:10,448 --> 01:31:12,116
Working on that now, Flight.

1264
01:31:12,117 --> 01:31:14,018
Hey. Who's Rich Purnell?

1265
01:31:14,019 --> 01:31:15,987
I dunno.

1266
01:31:15,988 --> 01:31:18,723
Will somebody find out who
the hell Rich Purnell is?

1267
01:31:18,724 --> 01:31:20,625
Annie will go before
the media this morning...

1268
01:31:20,626 --> 01:31:22,361
and inform them of NASA's decision

1269
01:31:22,362 --> 01:31:25,295
to reroute the <i>Hermes</i> to Mars.

1270
01:31:25,296 --> 01:31:27,332
Sounds like a smart move.

1271
01:31:28,032 --> 01:31:31,001
Considering the circumstances.

1272
01:31:31,002 --> 01:31:35,606
Whoever gave them the maneuver
only passed along information.

1273
01:31:35,607 --> 01:31:37,642
Crew made the decision on their own.

1274
01:31:39,211 --> 01:31:41,347
You may have killed them, Mitch.

1275
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:45,183
We're fighting the same war.

1276
01:31:45,184 --> 01:31:46,518
Every time something goes wrong,

1277
01:31:46,519 --> 01:31:48,385
the world forgets why we fly.

1278
01:31:48,386 --> 01:31:50,155
I'm trying to keep us airborne.

1279
01:31:50,156 --> 01:31:52,357
It's bigger than one person.

1280
01:31:53,893 --> 01:31:55,661
No.

1281
01:31:55,662 --> 01:31:57,096
It's not.

1282
01:31:58,096 --> 01:32:02,000
When this is over, I'll
expect your resignation.

1283
01:32:04,937 --> 01:32:06,438
I understand.

1284
01:32:06,439 --> 01:32:09,241
Bring our astronauts home.

1285
01:32:12,211 --> 01:32:15,013
Every <i>Ares</i> mission requires
three years of pre-supplies.

1286
01:32:15,014 --> 01:32:17,682
So NASA decided a long time
ago it's a lot easier...

1287
01:32:17,683 --> 01:32:19,116
to send some of the stuff beforehand

1288
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:20,552
rather than bring it with us.

1289
01:32:20,553 --> 01:32:24,156
So, as a result, the MAV for <i>Ares 4...</i>

1290
01:32:24,157 --> 01:32:25,523
is already there

1291
01:32:25,524 --> 01:32:27,692
at the Schiaparelli Crater, just waiting.

1292
01:32:27,693 --> 01:32:31,429
So the plan is for me to
use that to go into orbit...

1293
01:32:31,430 --> 01:32:34,465
just as the <i>Hermes</i> is passing...

1294
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:38,136
and I guess they catch me?

1295
01:32:38,737 --> 01:32:40,705
In space.

1296
01:32:43,675 --> 01:32:46,111
So, I've got 200 sols to figure out...

1297
01:32:46,112 --> 01:32:48,946
how to take everything here
that's keeping me alive...

1298
01:32:48,947 --> 01:32:50,615
the oxygenator, the water reclaimer,

1299
01:32:50,616 --> 01:32:52,616
the atmospheric regulator...

1300
01:32:52,617 --> 01:32:54,853
<i>bring that all with me.</i>

1301
01:32:54,854 --> 01:32:57,220

1302
01:32:57,221 --> 01:32:58,789

01:32:58,790 --> 01:33:01,692

01:33:01,693 --> 01:33:03,728

1305
01:33:03,729 --> 01:33:05,563
<i>And so far they've come up with...</i>

1306
01:33:05,564 --> 01:33:06,697
<i>"Hey, why don't you drill holes</i>

1307
01:33:06,698 --> 01:33:08,299

01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,234

1309
01:33:11,269 --> 01:33:13,437

<i>if you're not in any

<i>maritime law applies.</i>

1376
01:38:26,919 --> 01:38:30,688
<i>So Mars is international waters.</i>

1377
01:38:30,689 --> 01:38:34,091
<i>Now, NASA is an American

1383
01:38:43,434 --> 01:38:46,704
Nobody explicitly gave me
permission to do this...

<i>and they can't until

1402
01:41:23,795 --> 01:41:26,696
Drives for four hours before noon...

1403
01:41:26,697 --> 01:41:28,098
lays the solar panels,

1404
01:41:28,099 --> 01:41:30,233
waits 13 hours for them to recharge...

1405
01:41:30,234 --> 01:41:34,739

there and then starts again.

1406
01:41:36,541 --> 01:41:37,942
How's he doing?

1407
01:41:39,944 --> 01:41:42,980
He asked us to call
him Captain Blondebeard.

1408
01:41:44,683 --> 01:41:46,784
Well, technically, Mars
would be under maritime...

1409
01:41:46,785 --> 01:41:48,552
Yeah, I know. He explained it to us.

1410
01:41:49,988 --> 01:41:51,622
Where is he?

1411
01:41:52,456 --> 01:41:53,857
- There.
- Okay.

1412
01:41:53,858 --> 01:41:55,459
Here.

1413
01:41:55,460 --> 01:41:56,928
Okay.

1414
01:43:41,366 --> 01:43:43,466
<i>Okay, I'm gonna start by
stating for the record</i>

1415
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:45,035
<i>that you're not gonna like this.</i>

1416
01:43:45,036 --> 01:43:46,671
Oh, yeah?

1417
01:43:47,139 --> 01:43:49,741
Yeah, the problem is
the intercept velocity.

1418
01:43:49,742 --> 01:43:54,644
The <i>Hermes,</i> well...
It can't enter Mars' orbit.

1419
01:43:54,645 --> 01:43:58,014
Otherwise, they'll never have
enough fuel to make it home.

1420
01:43:58,015 --> 01:44:00,049
The MAV, that was only designed

1421
01:44:00,050 --> 01:44:02,719
to get to low Mars orbit.

1422
01:44:02,720 --> 01:44:06,823
So in order for Mark to escape
Mars' gravity entirely...

1423
01:44:06,824 --> 01:44:08,392
and to intercept the <i>Hermes...</i>

1424
01:44:08,393 --> 01:44:10,393
- He has to be going fast.
- Exactly.

1425
01:44:10,394 --> 01:44:12,597
<i>Which means we need to
make the MAV lighter.</i>

1426
01:44:12,598 --> 01:44:15,265
<i>A lot lighter. 5,000 kilograms lighter.</i>

1427
01:44:15,266 --> 01:44:16,700
You can do that, right?

1428
01:44:16,701 --> 01:44:18,634
<i>There's some gimmes right off the bat.</i>

1429
01:44:18,635 --> 01:44:20,237
<i>The design presumes 500 kilograms</i>

1430
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:21,906
<i>of Martian soil and samples.</i>

1431
01:44:21,907 --> 01:44:23,706
Obviously we won't do that.

1432
01:44:23,707 --> 01:44:27,545
And there's just one
passenger instead of six.

1433
01:44:27,546 --> 01:44:30,281
With suits and gear, that's another 500?

1434
01:44:30,282 --> 01:44:32,549
Ditch the life support, don't need it.

1435
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:34,384
And we'll get Mark to wear
his EVA suit the whole trip.

1436
01:44:34,385 --> 01:44:36,120
Wait a second. If he's in his EVA suit,

1437
01:44:36,121 --> 01:44:37,455
how is he gonna operate the controls?

1438
01:44:37,456 --> 01:44:39,889
Well, he won't.

1439
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:43,759
Martinez will pilot the MAV
remotely from the <i>Hermes.</i>

1440
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:46,664
We've never had a manned ship
controlled remotely before.

1441
01:44:47,831 --> 01:44:50,201
But I am excited about

1442
01:44:50,202 --> 01:44:52,536
the opportunities that affords.

1443
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:55,004
If we go remote, we can
lose the control panels,

1444
01:44:55,005 --> 01:44:56,807
the secondary and tertiary comm systems.

1445
01:44:56,808 --> 01:44:58,107
<i>Wait a second.</i>

1446
01:44:58,108 --> 01:45:02,179
<i>You want a remote-controlled
ascent with no backup comms?</i>

1447
01:45:04,215 --> 01:45:06,851
He's not even got to the
bad stuff yet, Vincent.

1448
01:45:06,852 --> 01:45:08,518
Let's skip to the bad stuff!

1449
01:45:08,519 --> 01:45:10,353
We need to remove the nose airlock,

1450
01:45:10,354 --> 01:45:13,457
the windows, and Hull Panel 19.

1451
01:45:14,992 --> 01:45:16,125
You want to take the front of the ship off?

1452
01:45:16,126 --> 01:45:17,693
<i>Sure.</i>

1453
01:45:17,694 --> 01:45:20,597
<i>The nose airlock alone
is 400 kilograms.</i>

1454
01:45:20,598 --> 01:45:21,964
You want to send a man into space

1455
01:45:21,965 --> 01:45:22,966
without the front of his ship?

1456
01:45:22,967 --> 01:45:24,703
<i>Well, no.</i>

1457
01:45:25,470 --> 01:45:28,840
<i>We're gonna have him
cover it with Hab canvas.</i>

1458
01:45:29,440 --> 01:45:33,043
<i>Look, the hull's mostly
there to keep the air in.</i>

1459
01:45:33,044 --> 01:45:34,611
Mars' atmosphere is so thin,

1460
01:45:34,612 --> 01:45:36,412
you don't need a lot of streamlining.

1461
01:45:36,413 --> 01:45:37,947
By the time the ship's going fast enough

1462
01:45:37,948 --> 01:45:39,750
for air resistance to matter...

1463
01:45:39,751 --> 01:45:42,385
it'll be high enough that
there's practically no air.

1464
01:45:42,386 --> 01:45:44,821
You wanna send him into space under a tarp.

1465
01:45:44,822 --> 01:45:47,057
<i>Yes.</i>

1466
01:45:47,058 --> 01:45:48,858
<i>Can I go on?</i>

1467
01:45:48,859 --> 01:45:50,427
No.

1468
01:45:56,434 --> 01:45:59,068
You think he means it like...

1469
01:45:59,069 --> 01:46:01,071
"Are you kidding me?"

1470
01:46:01,072 --> 01:46:02,505
- You know?
- Mmm-hmm.

1471
01:46:02,506 --> 01:46:06,043
Or like, "Are you kidding me?"

1472
01:46:06,510 --> 01:46:08,211
I think it might be the second one.

1473
01:46:08,212 --> 01:46:09,912
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

1474
01:46:09,913 --> 01:46:12,182
Could be the first way.

1475
01:46:12,183 --> 01:46:13,852
"Are you kidding me?"

1476
01:46:14,385 --> 01:46:16,421
Yeah, it could be the first way.

1477
01:46:40,412 --> 01:46:43,479
<i>I know what they're doing.</i>

1478
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,183
I know exactly what they're doing.

1479
01:46:46,184 --> 01:46:48,419
They just keep repeating...

1480
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:51,388
"Go faster than any man in
the history of space travel."

1481
01:46:51,389 --> 01:46:52,822
<i>Like that's a good thing.</i>

1482
01:46:52,823 --> 01:46:55,260
<i>Like it'll distract me from
how insane their plan is.</i>

1483
01:46:56,461 --> 01:46:58,094
Yeah, I get to go faster than any man

1484
01:46:58,095 --> 01:47:00,296
in the history of space travel...

1485
01:47:00,297 --> 01:47:03,133
because you are launching
me in a convertible.

1486
01:47:03,134 --> 01:47:04,934
Actually it's worse than that

1487
01:47:04,935 --> 01:47:06,970
because I won't even be
able to control the thing.

1488
01:47:06,971 --> 01:47:09,772
<i>And by the way, physicists,</i>

1489
01:47:09,773 --> 01:47:12,543
<i>when describing things
like acceleration...</i>

1490
01:47:12,544 --> 01:47:15,046
<i>do not use the word "fast."</i>

1491
01:47:15,613 --> 01:47:17,747
So they're only doing that in the hopes

1492
01:47:17,748 --> 01:47:20,250
that I won't raise any objections...

1493
01:47:20,818 --> 01:47:23,320
to this lunacy.

1494
01:47:23,854 --> 01:47:25,656
<i>Because I like the way</i>

1495
01:47:25,657 --> 01:47:28,827
<i>"fastest man in the history
of space travel" sounds.</i>

1496
01:47:30,194 --> 01:47:32,497
<i>I do like the way it sounds.</i>

1497
01:47:33,264 --> 01:47:35,499
<i>I mean, I like it a lot.</i>

1498
01:47:37,602 --> 01:47:40,171
<i>I'm not gonna tell them that.</i>

1499
01:47:45,775 --> 01:47:47,278
<i>Okay.</i>

1500
01:47:48,346 --> 01:47:50,481

1536
01:50:23,734 --> 01:50:25,001
<i>with the outer door open...</i>

1537
01:50:25,002 --> 01:50:26,969
<i>- before the MAV even launches.
- Okay.</i>

1538
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:30,674
<i>Martinez flies the MAV,
Johanssen sysops the ascent.</i>

1539
01:50:30,675 --> 01:50:32,608
<i>Once we hit intercept,</i>

1540
01:50:32,609 --> 01:50:34,544
<i>it's Beck's job to go get Watney.</i>

1541
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:35,745
We're ready.

1542
01:50:35,746 --> 01:50:37,382
What's the intercept plan?

1543
01:50:38,049 --> 01:50:40,383
We finished attaching the
tethers into one long line.

1544
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,486
It's 214 meters long.

1545
01:50:42,487 --> 01:50:43,754
And I'll have the MMU,

1546
01:50:43,755 --> 01:50:45,522
so moving around should be easy.

1547
01:50:45,523 --> 01:50:47,557
How fast a relative
velocity can you handle?

1548
01:50:48,425 --> 01:50:50,994
I can grab the MAV at 5 meters per second.

1549
01:50:50,995 --> 01:50:53,429
10 is like jumping onto a moving train.

1550
01:50:53,430 --> 01:50:55,397
So any more than that and I might miss.

1551
01:50:55,398 --> 01:50:57,534
Well, we may have some leeway.

1552
01:50:58,736 --> 01:51:00,804
The launch takes 12 minutes.

1553
01:51:00,805 --> 01:51:04,308
And it'll be 52 minutes before intercept.

1554
01:51:04,309 --> 01:51:06,777
Once Mark's engine shuts off...

1555
01:51:06,778 --> 01:51:09,278
we'll know our intercept
point and velocity.

1556
01:51:09,279 --> 01:51:11,115
Vogel, you're Beck's backup.

1557
01:51:11,116 --> 01:51:13,817
Everything goes well, you pull
them on board with the tether.

1558
01:51:13,818 --> 01:51:16,487
If anything goes wrong,
you go out after him.

1559
01:51:16,488 --> 01:51:17,821
Yep.

1560
01:51:17,822 --> 01:51:19,256
Okay.

1561
01:51:21,192 --> 01:51:23,694
Let's go get our boy.

1562
01:52:24,788 --> 01:52:26,688
There's a mood
of tension and anxiety here,

1563
01:52:26,689 --> 01:52:28,191
outside Johnson Space Center.

1564
01:52:28,192 --> 01:52:29,460
As you can see,

1565
01:52:29,461 --> 01:52:30,759
many people have gathered here...

1566
01:52:30,760 --> 01:52:32,128
to see whether or not

1567
01:52:32,129 --> 01:52:36,366
the mission to retrieve Mark
Watney will be a success.

1568
01:52:36,367 --> 01:52:38,201
<i>They've had some contact with him,</i>

1569
01:52:38,202 --> 01:52:40,237
<i>but it hasn't been very much.</i>

1570
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:41,604
<i>We have to remind our viewers</i>

1571
01:52:41,605 --> 01:52:43,505
<i>that we're watching this as it unfolds.</i>

1572
01:52:43,506 --> 01:52:45,442
<i>So we'll try and keep you up-to-date</i>

1573
01:52:45,443 --> 01:52:47,411
<i>as to what exactly is going on.</i>

1574
01:52:47,412 --> 01:52:51,113
<i>Let's listen in to NASA making
contact with Mark Watney.</i>

1575
01:52:51,114 --> 01:52:52,682
<i>Let's listen in.</i>

1576
01:52:59,189 --> 01:53:01,624
If something goes wrong,
what can Mission Control do?

1577
01:53:01,625 --> 01:53:04,628
Not a damn thing.

1578
01:53:04,629 --> 01:53:06,597
It's all happening 12
light-minutes away...

1579
01:53:06,598 --> 01:53:08,197
which means it takes 24 minutes for them

1580
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:10,467
to get the answer to any question they ask.

1581
01:53:11,301 --> 01:53:13,604
The whole launch is 12 minutes...

1582
01:53:14,872 --> 01:53:16,874
so they're on their own.

1583
01:54:22,005 --> 01:54:22,872
<i>...just how
long Mark has been</i>

1584
01:54:22,873 --> 01:54:24,273
<i>completely alone on Mars.</i>

1585
01:54:24,274 --> 01:54:27,444
<i>We're talking to a psychology
expert later to discuss...</i>

1586
01:54:49,934 --> 01:54:51,701
<i>Fuel pressure, green.</i>

1587
01:54:51,702 --> 01:54:54,036
Engine alignment, perfect.

1588
01:54:54,037 --> 01:54:55,705
<i>Communications, five by five.</i>

1589
01:54:57,273 --> 01:55:00,210
<i>We are ready for pre-flight
checklist, Commander.</i>

1590
01:55:00,211 --> 01:55:02,746
<i>Mission Control, this
is</i> Hermes <i>actual.</i>

1591
01:55:02,747 --> 01:55:05,049
<i>We will proceed on schedule.</i>

1592
01:55:05,050 --> 01:55:06,883
<i>We are T-minus 2 minutes, 10 seconds</i>

1593
01:55:06,884 --> 01:55:08,753
<i>to launch, by the mark.</i>

1594
01:55:09,653 --> 01:55:10,821
About two minutes, Watney.

1595
01:55:10,822 --> 01:55:12,055
<i>How you doing down there?</i>

1596
01:55:12,056 --> 01:55:14,022
I'm good.

1597
01:55:14,023 --> 01:55:16,491
I'm anxious to get up to you.

1598
01:55:16,492 --> 01:55:17,861
Thanks for coming back for me.

1599
01:55:17,862 --> 01:55:19,196
<i>Well, we're on it.</i>

1600
01:55:19,197 --> 01:55:20,830
<i>Remember, you'll be
pulling some serious G's,</i>

1601
01:55:20,831 --> 01:55:22,732
<i>so it's okay to pass out.</i>

1602
01:55:22,733 --> 01:55:24,934
You're in Martinez's hands now.

1603
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:27,304
Well, tell that asshole no barrel rolls.

1604
01:55:28,672 --> 01:55:30,439
Copy that, MAV.

1605
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:31,607
<i>CAPCOM.</i>

1606
01:55:31,608 --> 01:55:32,809
<i>Go.</i>

1607
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:33,742
<i>Remote command.</i>

1608
01:55:33,743 --> 01:55:34,777
<i>Go.</i>

1609
01:55:34,778 --> 01:55:35,845
<i>Recovery.</i>

1610
01:55:35,846 --> 01:55:37,045
<i>Go.</i>

1611
01:55:37,046 --> 01:55:38,514
<i>Secondary recovery.</i>

1612
01:55:38,515 --> 01:55:39,515
<i>Go.</i>

1613
01:55:39,516 --> 01:55:41,017
Pilot.

1614
01:55:41,986 --> 01:55:43,186
Go.

1615
01:55:43,187 --> 01:55:44,621
<i>Pilot.</i>

1616
01:55:44,622 --> 01:55:46,054
<i>Go.</i>

1617
01:55:46,055 --> 01:55:47,935
<i>Copy. We're go.</i>

1618
01:55:48,158 --> 01:55:50,761
<i>Mission Control,
we are go for launch.</i>

1619
01:55:51,196 --> 01:55:52,394
T-minus ten...

1620
01:55:52,395 --> 01:55:53,563
nine...

1621
01:55:53,564 --> 01:55:54,731
Main engine start.

1622
01:55:54,732 --> 01:55:56,198
<i>Eight...</i>

1623
01:55:56,199 --> 01:55:57,466
<i>seven...</i>

1624
01:55:57,467 --> 01:55:59,268
<i>Mooring clamps released.</i>

1625
01:55:59,269 --> 01:56:01,004
About five seconds, Watney. Hang on.

1626
01:56:01,005 --> 01:56:02,872
I'll see you in a few, Commander.

1627
01:56:02,873 --> 01:56:04,506
<i>Four...</i>

1628
01:56:04,507 --> 01:56:06,174
<i>three...</i>

1629
01:56:06,175 --> 01:56:07,643
<i>two...</i>

1630
01:56:07,644 --> 01:56:09,347
<i>one.</i>

1631
01:56:45,215 --> 01:56:47,651
Velocity, 741 meters per second.

1632
01:56:47,652 --> 01:56:49,719
Altitude, 1350 meters.

1633
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:51,021
That's too low.

1634
01:56:51,022 --> 01:56:52,690
It's fighting me.

1635
01:56:56,260 --> 01:56:59,429
<i>Watney, do you read?</i>

1636
01:57:05,470 --> 01:57:06,902
<i>Booster separation complete.</i>

1637
01:57:06,903 --> 01:57:10,040
Velocity, 850. Altitude, 1843.

1638
01:57:10,041 --> 01:57:11,375
He's well below target altitude.

1639
01:57:11,376 --> 01:57:13,043
How far below?

1640
01:57:13,044 --> 01:57:14,643
Checking.

1641
01:57:14,644 --> 01:57:16,580
Watney.

1642
01:57:16,581 --> 01:57:18,080
Do you read?

1643
01:57:18,081 --> 01:57:19,381
<i>He's probably passed out.</i>

1644
01:57:19,382 --> 01:57:20,616
<i>He pulled 12 g's on the ascent.</i>

1645
01:57:20,617 --> 01:57:21,951
<i>Give him a few minutes.</i>

1646
01:57:21,952 --> 01:57:23,621
<i>Copy that.</i>

1647
01:57:25,723 --> 01:57:27,490
<i>Main shutdown in three...</i>

1648
01:57:27,491 --> 01:57:29,726
<i>two, one...</i>

1649
01:57:29,727 --> 01:57:31,195
<i>shutdown.</i>

1650
01:57:32,529 --> 01:57:34,431
<i>Back to automatic guidance.</i>

1651
01:57:34,864 --> 01:57:36,667
<i>Shutdown confirmed.</i>

1652
01:57:38,736 --> 01:57:40,870
<i>Fuel reserves depleted.</i>

1653
01:57:42,406 --> 01:57:43,973
<i>Watney?</i>

1654
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:45,775
<i>Do you read?</i>

1655
01:57:46,410 --> 01:57:47,643
<i>It seems there's some sort of problem</i>

1656
01:57:47,644 --> 01:57:49,579
<i>with the transmission.</i>

1657
01:57:56,252 --> 01:57:58,188
<i>I have interval pings.</i>

1658
01:57:58,189 --> 01:58:00,022
Intercept velocity will
be 11 meters per second.

1659
01:58:00,023 --> 01:58:02,192
I can make that work.

1660
01:58:02,727 --> 01:58:05,228
Distance at intercept will be...

1661
01:58:05,229 --> 01:58:07,464
We'll be 68 kilometers apart.

1662
01:58:07,465 --> 01:58:09,566
<i>68 kilometers?</i>

1663
01:58:09,567 --> 01:58:12,203
<i>Did she just say 68 kilometers?</i>

1664
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:13,702
Come on, guys, keep it together.

1665
01:58:13,703 --> 01:58:15,105
Work the problem.

1666
01:58:15,538 --> 01:58:17,906
Johanssen, time to intercept?

1667
01:58:17,907 --> 01:58:20,077
<i>39 minutes, 12 seconds.</i>

1668
01:58:20,510 --> 01:58:21,911
Martinez, what if we point our thrusters

1669
01:58:21,912 --> 01:58:23,713
in the same direction?

1670
01:58:23,714 --> 01:58:26,983
Well, it depends how much
fuel you wanna save...

1671
01:58:26,984 --> 01:58:28,116
for the altitude adjustments
for the trip home.

1672
01:58:28,117 --> 01:58:29,518
How much do you need?

1673
01:58:29,519 --> 01:58:34,090
I can get by with about
20% of what we have left.

1674
01:58:35,059 --> 01:58:38,327
If we use 75.5% of remaining
altitude-adjust fuel...

1675
01:58:38,328 --> 01:58:40,196
that will bring the
intercept range to zero.

1676
01:58:40,197 --> 01:58:41,664
Do it.

1677
01:58:42,199 --> 01:58:45,602
Hang on. It brings the range to zero...

1678
01:58:45,603 --> 01:58:48,204
but the intercept velocity
will be 42 meters per second.

1679
01:58:48,205 --> 01:58:50,473
<i>And that's way too fast.</i>

1680
01:58:50,474 --> 01:58:52,474
Then we'll have 39 minutes to figure out

1681
01:58:52,475 --> 01:58:54,278
how to slow down.

1682
01:58:57,014 --> 01:58:58,915
Martinez, burn the jets.

1683
01:58:58,916 --> 01:59:00,784
Copy that.

1684
01:59:22,739 --> 01:59:24,840
MAV to <i>Hermes.</i>

1685
01:59:24,841 --> 01:59:26,008
<i>Watney?</i>

1686
01:59:26,009 --> 01:59:27,009
<i>Affirmative.</i>

1687
01:59:31,114 --> 01:59:32,881
<i>What's your status?</i>

1688
01:59:32,882 --> 01:59:34,851
<i>My chest hurts.</i>

1689
01:59:34,852 --> 01:59:37,019
<i>I broke my ribs.</i>

1690
01:59:37,020 --> 01:59:38,454
<i>How are you?</i>

1691
01:59:38,455 --> 01:59:39,555
<i>We're working on getting to you.</i>

1692
01:59:39,556 --> 01:59:41,058
<i>There was a complication during launch.</i>

1693
01:59:41,059 --> 01:59:42,992
Copy that.

1694
01:59:42,993 --> 01:59:45,027
How bad is it?

1695
01:59:45,028 --> 01:59:46,530
<i>We've corrected
the intercept range,</i>

1696
01:59:46,531 --> 01:59:48,665
<i>but we've got a problem
with intercept velocity.</i>

1697
01:59:48,666 --> 01:59:49,933
<i>How big a problem?</i>

1698
01:59:49,934 --> 01:59:51,701
42 meters a second.

1699
01:59:51,702 --> 01:59:53,203
Well...

1700
01:59:53,938 --> 01:59:56,006
shit.

1701
02:00:00,678 --> 02:00:02,579
<i>Commander, I have an idea.</i>

1702
02:00:02,580 --> 02:00:04,313
<i>Go ahead, Mark.</i>

1703
02:00:04,314 --> 02:00:07,549
Well, if I can find
something sharp in here...

1704
02:00:07,550 --> 02:00:10,554
and poke a hole in the
glove of my EVA suit...

1705
02:00:10,555 --> 02:00:13,022
I could use the escaping
air as a thruster...

1706
02:00:13,023 --> 02:00:14,756
<i>and fly towards you.</i>

1707
02:00:14,757 --> 02:00:18,227
<i>It would be easy to control
because it would be on my arm.</i>

1708
02:00:18,228 --> 02:00:20,063
I can't see you having
any control if you did that.

1709
02:00:20,064 --> 02:00:21,997
You'd be eyeballing the intercept

1710
02:00:21,998 --> 02:00:24,433
using a thrust vector
you can barely control.

1711
02:00:24,434 --> 02:00:28,170
Yes, those are all very good points.

1712
02:00:28,171 --> 02:00:31,341
But consider this.

1713
02:00:33,210 --> 02:00:35,844
I'd get to fly around like Iron Man.

1714
02:00:37,014 --> 02:00:38,813
<i>Commander...</i>

1715
02:00:38,814 --> 02:00:40,883
<i>let's go Iron Man.</i>

1716
02:00:43,586 --> 02:00:45,287
<i>This is unexpected LOS.</i>

1717
02:00:45,288 --> 02:00:47,368
<i>Communication lost. Stand by.</i>

1718
02:00:48,024 --> 02:00:50,893
Maybe it's not the worst idea.

1719
02:00:50,894 --> 02:00:52,762
No, it is the worst idea.
It's the worst idea ever.

1720
02:00:52,763 --> 02:00:54,063
Not what he said.

1721
02:00:54,064 --> 02:00:56,667
Using atmosphere as thrust.

1722
02:00:58,469 --> 02:01:00,670
What happens if we blow the VAL?

1723
02:01:00,671 --> 02:01:02,705
Wait, you want to open
the vehicular airlock?

1724
02:01:02,706 --> 02:01:04,040
It'll give us a good kick.

1725
02:01:04,041 --> 02:01:06,108
But also blow the nose off the ship.

1726
02:01:06,109 --> 02:01:09,012
And all the air would leave
and we need air to not die.

1727
02:01:09,013 --> 02:01:11,247
We would seal the bridge
and the reactor room.

1728
02:01:11,248 --> 02:01:12,881
Everywhere else would go vacuo.

1729
02:01:12,882 --> 02:01:14,183
Vogel.

1730
02:01:14,184 --> 02:01:16,085
<i>Go ahead, Commander.</i>

1731
02:01:16,086 --> 02:01:19,121
I need you to come
inside and make a... bomb.

1732
02:01:19,122 --> 02:01:20,223
Again, Commander?

1733
02:01:20,224 --> 02:01:21,524
<i>You're a chemist.</i>

1734
02:01:21,525 --> 02:01:23,694
<i>Can you make a bomb with
what you have on board?</i>

1735
02:01:24,795 --> 02:01:26,664
Probably.

1736
02:01:27,229 --> 02:01:28,664
But I feel obliged to mention

1737
02:01:28,665 --> 02:01:30,700
that setting off an explosive device...

1738
02:01:30,701 --> 02:01:33,670
<i>in a spacecraft is a
terrible, terrible idea.</i>

1739
02:01:33,671 --> 02:01:36,772
Hang on. You guys making a bomb without me?

1740
02:01:36,773 --> 02:01:39,108
<i>Copy that. Can you do it?</i>

1741
02:01:40,944 --> 02:01:42,445
<i>Ja.</i>

1742
02:01:45,116 --> 02:01:47,049
<i>Houston, be advised.</i>

1743
02:01:47,050 --> 02:01:48,317
<i>We are going to
deliberately breach the VAL</i>

1744
02:01:48,318 --> 02:01:50,254
<i>to produce a reverse thrust.</i>

1745
02:01:51,354 --> 02:01:53,756
Beck, leave your suit on.
Meet Johanssen in Airlock 1.

1746
02:01:53,757 --> 02:01:55,157
We'll open the outer door.

1747
02:01:55,158 --> 02:01:57,227
<i>I need you to place the
charge on the inner door.</i>

1748
02:01:57,228 --> 02:01:59,260
<i>Climb back to Airlock 2 along the hull.</i>

1749
02:01:59,261 --> 02:02:01,464
Copy. I'm on my way.

1750
02:02:08,272 --> 02:02:10,039
I'm in, Commander.

1751
02:02:10,040 --> 02:02:11,408
<i>Copy that.</i>

1752
02:02:20,184 --> 02:02:22,084
Vogel, where are you?

1753
02:02:22,085 --> 02:02:23,018
<i>I'm in the kitchen.</i>

1754
02:02:23,019 --> 02:02:24,721
Okay.

1755
02:02:28,190 --> 02:02:29,459
<i>Commander...</i>

1756
02:02:29,460 --> 02:02:31,393
I can't let you go through with this.

1757
02:02:31,394 --> 02:02:33,162
I am prepared to cut the suit.

1758
02:02:33,163 --> 02:02:34,696
Absolutely not.

1759
02:02:34,697 --> 02:02:37,399
<i>See, the thing is, I'm selfish.</i>

1760
02:02:37,400 --> 02:02:39,969
I want all the memorials
back home to be about me.

1761
02:02:39,970 --> 02:02:41,336
<i>Just me.</i>

1762
02:02:41,337 --> 02:02:43,738
I should have left this guy on Mars.

1763
02:02:43,739 --> 02:02:45,241
Hey.

1764
02:02:47,644 --> 02:02:48,711
Sugar?

1765
02:02:48,712 --> 02:02:50,213
Yeah.

1766
02:02:53,916 --> 02:02:55,951
Can you hold this?

1767
02:02:55,952 --> 02:02:58,088
Liquid oxygen...

1768
02:02:58,089 --> 02:03:01,825
and some stain remover
that contains ammonia.

1769
02:03:05,028 --> 02:03:08,298
This thing here is five times stronger

1770
02:03:08,299 --> 02:03:09,765
than a stick of dynamite.

1771
02:03:09,766 --> 02:03:11,367
How do we activate it?

1772
02:03:11,368 --> 02:03:14,270
Can you connect this to
one of our lighting panels?

1773
02:03:17,273 --> 02:03:19,142
Careful.

1774
02:03:25,247 --> 02:03:27,183
Open Airlock 1.

1775
02:03:32,689 --> 02:03:34,249
I'm on the way to Beck.

1776
02:03:38,295 --> 02:03:39,896
Let's just hope this is a good idea, guys.

1777
02:03:39,897 --> 02:03:41,162
It is.

1778
02:03:41,163 --> 02:03:42,865
<i>Open A1.</i>

1779
02:03:47,705 --> 02:03:49,138
- Hi.
- Hey.

1780
02:03:52,309 --> 02:03:54,311
- You got it?
- Mmm.

1781
02:03:59,750 --> 02:04:02,519
Make sure you're not in here
when this thing goes off.

1782
02:04:03,854 --> 02:04:05,287
Hey.

1783
02:04:05,288 --> 02:04:07,189
Be careful out there.

1784
02:04:07,190 --> 02:04:08,991
In space.

1785
02:04:12,595 --> 02:04:15,364
Don't tell anyone I did that.

1786
02:04:24,940 --> 02:04:26,310
Bomb set.

1787
02:04:34,717 --> 02:04:37,421
Leaving Airlock 1.

1788
02:04:42,158 --> 02:04:43,326
Guys, I'm running the numbers,

1789
02:04:43,327 --> 02:04:44,661
and even with optimal VAL blow...

1790
02:04:44,662 --> 02:04:46,594
we're gonna be off on our angle.

1791
02:04:46,595 --> 02:04:49,365
What's the intercept distance? Johanssen?

1792
02:04:49,366 --> 02:04:51,835
260 meters, approximate.

1793
02:04:51,836 --> 02:04:53,503
That's too far.

1794
02:05:02,112 --> 02:05:03,579
Commander?

1795
02:05:03,580 --> 02:05:05,982
Martinez, close the door.

1796
02:05:08,885 --> 02:05:10,887
Open D3.

1797
02:05:10,888 --> 02:05:13,123
And leave it open.

1798
02:05:41,251 --> 02:05:43,420
<i>Open B2.</i>

1799
02:05:47,157 --> 02:05:48,691
Johanssen...

1800
02:05:48,692 --> 02:05:51,094
<i>time to VAL blow after initiate?</i>

1801
02:05:51,095 --> 02:05:52,661
15 seconds.

1802
02:05:52,662 --> 02:05:55,365
We sure know how to cut it close.

1803
02:05:55,366 --> 02:05:56,631
Commander?

1804
02:05:56,632 --> 02:05:59,102
Distance is too far. I'm going out.

1805
02:05:59,103 --> 02:06:00,236
I can do this.

1806
02:06:00,237 --> 02:06:01,603
It's not a debate.

1807
02:06:01,604 --> 02:06:03,339
I'm not risking another crew member.

1808
02:06:03,340 --> 02:06:05,174
Beck's returned.

1809
02:06:05,175 --> 02:06:07,143
Johanssen, initiate the bomb.

1810
02:06:07,144 --> 02:06:08,376
Ten seconds.

1811
02:06:08,377 --> 02:06:10,412
Strap in.

1812
02:06:10,413 --> 02:06:12,915
<i>Five, four...</i>

1813
02:06:12,916 --> 02:06:14,349
three...

1814
02:06:14,350 --> 02:06:16,218
- Brace for deceleration.
<i>two...</i>

1815
02:06:16,219 --> 02:06:17,452
one.

1816
02:06:17,453 --> 02:06:19,256
Activating Panel 41.

1817
02:06:40,943 --> 02:06:42,210
Bridge seal holding.

1818
02:06:42,211 --> 02:06:43,545
What's the damage?

1819
02:06:43,546 --> 02:06:44,746
<i>Worry about that later.</i>

1820
02:06:44,747 --> 02:06:46,447
<i>What's the relative velocity?</i>

1821
02:06:46,448 --> 02:06:47,982
12 meters per second.

1822
02:06:47,983 --> 02:06:50,384
<i>Copy.</i>

1823
02:06:51,421 --> 02:06:53,055
Hook me up.

1824
02:06:54,224 --> 02:06:56,026
Done.

1825
02:07:05,469 --> 02:07:07,571
I have visual on the MAV.

1826
02:07:08,571 --> 02:07:10,505
<i>What's the intercept range?</i>

1827
02:07:10,506 --> 02:07:12,541
I'm checking.

1828
02:07:12,542 --> 02:07:14,244
312 meters.

1829
02:07:14,245 --> 02:07:16,911
Did you say 312?

1830
02:07:16,912 --> 02:07:19,682
Great. I'll wave at you guys as I go by.

1831
02:07:22,853 --> 02:07:24,254
Oh!

1832
02:07:28,657 --> 02:07:30,625
I can't get to you, Mark. You're too far.

1833
02:07:30,626 --> 02:07:31,760
<i>I'm not gonna make it.</i>

1834
02:07:31,761 --> 02:07:32,995
I know.

1835
02:07:32,996 --> 02:07:34,930
<i>Beck, unhook me.
I'm going after him.</i>

1836
02:07:34,931 --> 02:07:37,700
Commander, I got this.

1837
02:07:51,215 --> 02:07:53,147
Mark, report.

1838
02:07:53,148 --> 02:07:54,950
On my way, Commander.

1839
02:07:54,951 --> 02:07:56,751
Damn it.

1840
02:08:06,095 --> 02:08:08,430
Johanssen, what's my
relative velocity to Mark?

1841
02:08:08,431 --> 02:08:10,465
5.2 meters per second.

1842
02:08:10,466 --> 02:08:12,468
Copy. Adjusting course.

1843
02:08:17,907 --> 02:08:20,077
<i>3.1 meters per second.</i>

1844
02:08:22,312 --> 02:08:24,681
<i>Distance to target, 24 meters.</i>

1845
02:08:26,215 --> 02:08:28,452
11 meters to target.

1846
02:08:30,953 --> 02:08:32,355
<i>Six meters.</i>

1847
02:08:42,166 --> 02:08:44,801
Hold on, Mark.

1848
02:09:12,363 --> 02:09:13,461
I got him.

1849
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:18,466
<i>I got him.</i>

1850
02:09:18,467 --> 02:09:20,068
<i>I got him.</i>

1851
02:09:20,069 --> 02:09:21,872
Way to go, Iron Man.

1852
02:09:24,608 --> 02:09:26,375
Beck, pull us in.

1853
02:09:29,279 --> 02:09:31,147
It's good to see you.

1854
02:09:32,349 --> 02:09:33,884
You...

1855
02:09:35,417 --> 02:09:39,488
have terrible taste in music.

1856
02:09:48,698 --> 02:09:50,465
<i>Houston, this
is</i> Hermes <i>actual.</i>

1857
02:09:50,466 --> 02:09:51,601
<i>We got him.</i>

1858
02:09:53,569 --> 02:09:55,204
<i>Watney is secure.</i>

1859
02:10:00,410 --> 02:10:02,644
Contact in
outer space with Mark Watney.

1860
02:10:02,645 --> 02:10:04,746
<i>After a very long time, they have done</i>

1861
02:10:04,747 --> 02:10:06,915
<i>what many people
thought was impossible.</i>

1862
02:10:06,916 --> 02:10:08,216
<i>Mission confirmation:</i>

1863
02:10:08,217 --> 02:10:10,919
<i>Mark Watney has been
successfully rescued.</i>

1864
02:10:14,523 --> 02:10:16,525
Grab a hold of him.

1865
02:10:18,094 --> 02:10:19,495
Hey, handsome!

1866
02:10:19,496 --> 02:10:21,531
Beck, close the hatch.

1867
02:10:24,266 --> 02:10:25,968
Hey, guys!

1868
02:10:30,474 --> 02:10:32,842
<i>Houston, six crew safely aboard.</i>

1869
02:10:37,147 --> 02:10:40,348
<i>This is huge moment for this
nation, for the world...</i>

1870
02:10:40,349 --> 02:10:43,818
<i>and indeed, for
international space travel.</i>

1871
02:10:43,819 --> 02:10:46,222
I can't believe
anything you do works.

1872
02:10:46,223 --> 02:10:47,856
Hey!

1873
02:10:49,525 --> 02:10:50,759
Oh, God.

1874
02:10:50,760 --> 02:10:52,729
I can't believe it.

1875
02:10:53,830 --> 02:10:55,363
There's a little smell
going on over there, bud.

1876
02:10:55,364 --> 02:10:59,134
I know. I haven't had a
shower in a year and a half.

1877
02:10:59,135 --> 02:11:01,738
Don't make me laugh, I have broken ribs.

1878
02:11:35,372 --> 02:11:36,940
Hey, there.

1879
02:11:45,180 --> 02:11:47,182
- Morning, sir.
- It's an honor, sir.

1880
02:11:47,183 --> 02:11:49,085
Sir.

1881
02:11:49,086 --> 02:11:50,885
- Sir.
- Sir.

1882
02:11:50,886 --> 02:11:52,521
Morning, sir.

1883
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:16,778
<i>Welcome to the
Astronaut Candidate Program.</i>

1884
02:12:16,779 --> 02:12:18,847
Now pay attention,

1885
02:12:18,848 --> 02:12:20,982
because this could save your life.

1886
02:12:20,983 --> 02:12:22,583
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

1887
02:12:24,019 --> 02:12:26,121
Let me get a few things out
of the way, right off the bat.

1888
02:12:26,122 --> 02:12:29,659
Yes, I did in fact survive
on a deserted planet

1889
02:12:29,660 --> 02:12:32,028
by farming in my own shit.

1890
02:12:32,996 --> 02:12:35,630
Yes, it's actually worse than it sounds.

1891
02:12:35,631 --> 02:12:37,633
So let's not talk about that ever again.

1892
02:12:38,835 --> 02:12:41,903
The other question I
get most frequently is...

1893
02:12:41,904 --> 02:12:44,639
"When I was up there, stranded by myself...

1894
02:12:44,640 --> 02:12:47,276
"did I think I was going to die?"

1895
02:12:47,277 --> 02:12:49,111
Yes, absolutely.

1896
02:12:50,147 --> 02:12:51,546
And that's what you need to know going in

1897
02:12:51,547 --> 02:12:53,615
because it's going to happen to you.

1898
02:12:53,616 --> 02:12:57,385
This is space. It does not cooperate.

1899
02:12:57,386 --> 02:13:00,054
At some point, everything
is going to go south on you.

1900
02:13:00,055 --> 02:13:01,357
Everything is going to go south

1901
02:13:01,358 --> 02:13:02,991
and you're going to say, "This is it.

1902
02:13:02,992 --> 02:13:05,061
"This is how I end."

1903
02:13:06,095 --> 02:13:08,263
Now, you can either accept that...

1904
02:13:08,264 --> 02:13:10,632
or you can get to work.

1905
02:13:11,300 --> 02:13:13,135
That's all it is.

1906
02:13:13,136 --> 02:13:15,437
You just begin.

1907
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:18,941
You do the math. You solve one problem...

1908
02:13:18,942 --> 02:13:20,642
then you solve the next one.

1909
02:13:20,643 --> 02:13:21,911
And then the next.

1910
02:13:21,912 --> 02:13:22,945
And if you solve enough problems,

1911
02:13:22,946 --> 02:13:25,013
you get to come home.

1912
02:13:25,447 --> 02:13:27,850
All right, questions?

1913
02:13:32,855 --> 02:13:34,022
<i>Once Mission Control completes</i>

1914
02:13:34,023 --> 02:13:35,156
<i>their pre-flight checks...</i>

1915
02:13:35,157 --> 02:13:37,526
<i>we'll begin launch procedures.</i>

1916
02:13:37,527 --> 02:13:39,995
<i>The</i> Ares 5 <i>team will
rendezvous with the</i> Hermes...

1917
02:13:39,996 --> 02:13:43,198
approximately 48 minutes after launch.

1918
02:13:43,199 --> 02:13:45,200
From there, they will have 414 days

1919
02:13:45,201 --> 02:13:47,235
of space travel ahead of them.

1920
02:13:47,236 --> 02:13:48,504
<i>Have the goals changed</i>

1921
02:13:48,505 --> 02:13:50,004
<i>from the previous mission...</i>

1922
02:13:50,005 --> 02:13:51,639
<i>to the</i> Ares 5 <i>program?</i>

1923
02:13:51,640 --> 02:13:53,675
<i>And what do you hope to
achieve this time around?</i>

1924
02:13:53,676 --> 02:13:55,410
<i>Well, no. The goals
have always been the same</i>

1925
02:13:55,411 --> 02:13:57,113
for the <i>Ares</i> program.

1926
02:13:57,848 --> 02:13:59,247
This time, of course, we hope to bring

1927
02:13:59,248 --> 02:14:00,888
all the astronauts back at the same time.

1928
02:14:01,850 --> 02:14:02,718
Flight, Guidance check complete.

1929
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:04,087
Copy, Guidance.

1930
02:14:05,189 --> 02:14:06,821
This is Flight.

1931
02:14:06,822 --> 02:14:08,857
We are go for launch, on schedule.

1932
02:14:19,501 --> 02:14:20,634
<i>Final aerosurface</i>

1933
02:14:20,635 --> 02:14:22,204
<i>checks are complete...</i>

1934
02:14:22,205 --> 02:14:25,540

00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,532
Kids can spot phonies.
They're very smart.

354
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:36,909
Kids know dick.

355
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:38,786
I watch them in my arcades.

356
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:42,915
They stand like laboratory rats hitting
the feeder bar to get a food pellet.

357
00:18:43,082 --> 00:18:45,376
But as long as they keep pumping in
the quarters, who gives a shit, right?

358
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,585
(LAUGHING)

359
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:48,796
Let me ask you something.

360
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,591
What is your single biggest problem
in the arcade business?

361
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:56,804
Well, keeping the customer
informed of new product.

362
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,390
Like, we have a new game
called Zantar.

363
00:18:59,473 --> 00:19:03,394
Zantar is a gelatinous cube
that eats warriors in a medieval village,

364
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:06,480
and every time it eats a chieftain,
you ascend to a higher level.

365
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,649
Beauty part is,
you can't get to the next level,

366
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:11,819
so the kids keep
coughing up quarters, you know.

367
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,405
Gelatinous cube eats village.

368
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:15,864
I think it's terrific.

369
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,449
You know, I know nothing
about video games.

370
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:19,243
I found what you just said riveting.

371
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:22,121
- Well, I do my own commercials.
- I did not know that.

372
00:19:22,204 --> 00:19:24,456
Of course, I don't mention the games
in the commercials,

373
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,751
because the technology moves
so much faster than the advertising.

374
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,337
I did not realize that.
Russell, did you realize that?

375
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:32,548
No, I did not realize that.

376
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:36,301
So, Mr. Vanderhoff,
let me see if I'm hearing you correctly.

377
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:40,514
Are you saying that if you had a spot,
say on a weekly show,

378
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:43,517
that you could come on the show
and update the kids

379
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,395
on exactly what was new
in your arcade?

380
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,690
- Yeah, that's it.
- Well, I'm impressed.

381
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,233
Wow.

382
00:19:52,693 --> 00:19:55,154

383
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:56,905
I've gotta tell you, I think that's brilliant.

384
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,365
Brilliant.

385
00:19:58,866 --> 00:19:59,992
Well, thank you.

386
00:20:00,075 --> 00:20:01,493
We'll get right to work on this.

00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:03,328
We'll send the contracts
over to your office.

388
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:05,164
We'll be in touch.

389
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,502
- I'd like to think about this.
- Oh, of course you would.

390
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,255
- I wouldn't have it any other way.
- VANDERHOFF: Yeah.

391
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:17,676
- She'll validate you.
- VANDERHOFF: Thank you.

You're learning Cassandra's language.

- Are you gonna marry her?
- Garth,

400
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:44,828
marriage is punishment for shoplifting
in some countries.

401
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,122
Okay, passed inspection.

402
00:20:47,206 --> 00:20:49,374
- All right.
- Just barely.

403

Okay, that's $42.57, Wayne,

404
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:55,547
- No way.
- Brutal.

00:20:55,631 --> 00:20:57,132
- Okay. There you go.
- We got it.

406
00:20:57,382 --> 00:20:59,092
- All right, we got it, we got it.
- That's not enough.

407
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:01,094
- What?
- We got that.

at Gasworks on Friday.

Yeah, we were there.

418
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,536
There was this band, Crucial Taunt.

for a lead singer. Unreal!

Do you know where we could find
Wayne Campbell?

That would be privileged information.

where they broadcast from.

get to know the crew?

First of all,
let me get this out of the way.

- I'm a big fan.
- You are?

471
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:56,395
The way I see it,
your show is capable of so much more.

472
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,480
Well, we'll try harder, okay?

473
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:00,148
Just give us a second chance.

My job, it's usually such a bore,

479
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:15,247
but the other day,
the most incredible thing happened.

480
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,416
- What happened?
- Noah Vanderhoff,

481
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:21,253
the owner of the largest chain of video
arcades in Chicago, is in my office,

482
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:24,548
and he asks me,
"What's with this show, <i>Wayne's World,</i>

483
00:24:24,631 --> 00:24:26,258
"that I keep hearing so much about?"

484
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,468
Well, I have all your shows on tape.

485
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:30,178
Like I said, I'm a fan.

486
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:31,763
I put a show in for him,

487
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:34,015
and he literally jumped out of his seat.

488
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,100
- Cool.
- Cool.

489
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:37,310
Immediately,
he wants to sponsor the show,

490
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:38,812
put you on our station,

491
00:24:38,895 --> 00:24:41,356
and pay you guys a huge salary.

492
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,442
Of course, what he doesn't realize
is that you're both artists

493
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:44,901
and that you're not interested in money.

494
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:47,070
No, we're not interested in money.

495
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:48,280
BENJAMIN: That's what I told him.

496
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,073
But he said, "Go to Aurora anyway,

497
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:54,077
"and take two cashier's checks with you,
so they at least know that I'm serious."

I know that I may be wasting my time,

499
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:58,248
but here I am with the contract

500
00:24:58,331 --> 00:25:00,041
and two cashier's checks

501
00:25:00,125 --> 00:25:03,170
for $5,000 each.

00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,176
It sounded like you said you were gonna
pay us for doing <i>Wayne's World.</i>

504
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:12,179
I know. You just give me the word
and I'll tear up these checks right here.

- Do you have a lawyer?

Yes. Uh... No.

You see, our first lawyer
screwed our affairs so badly...

513
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,867
That's right. I walked right into
that office, that's what I did,

514
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,453
and I reached across that desk,
and I grabbed him by his big fat head,

515
00:25:36,536 --> 00:25:40,749
and I said, "Listen, man,
I'm not going to jail for you or anybody."

516
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:42,000
Exactly.

Excuse me. Wayne?

872
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:14,374
Can I put the Fender back now, please?

873
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:17,336
Not today, my good man.
I'm feeling saucy.

874
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:18,879

Have you spoken to Wayne
about the Vanderhoff spot?

877
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:36,772
Yes, briefly. He was not very receptive.

878
00:47:37,272 --> 00:47:40,484
Oh, really? Well, I'll explain it to him
that it's not a choice,

879
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:41,944
it's in his contract.

880
00:47:42,027 --> 00:47:44,780
Oh. Well, Wayne
will understand that right away.

881
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,324
Not.

882
00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:50,994
Excuse me.

883
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:53,789
I mean,
there was two Darrin Stephens, right?

885
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:59,044
Yeah, right, as if we wouldn't notice.

886

Oh, hold on.

887

Wayne.

890
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:13,267
Listen, we need to have
a talk about Vanderhoff.

891
00:48:13,475 --> 00:48:14,977
The fact is, he's the sponsor,

892
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:18,313
and you signed a contract
guaranteeing him certain concessions,

893
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:20,232
one of them being a spot on the show.

894
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:22,818
Well, that's where I see things
just a little differently.

895
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:25,696
Contract or no,
I will not bow to any sponsor.

896
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:32,661
I'm sorry you feel that way, but
basically, it's the nature of the beast.

897
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:34,163
Maybe I'm wrong on this one,

898
00:48:34,246 --> 00:48:36,957
but for me,
the beast doesn't include selling out.

899
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:44,339
Garth, you know what
I'm talking about, right?

900
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:51,263
It's like people only do things
because they get paid,

901
00:48:51,722 --> 00:48:53,932
and that's just really sad.

902
00:48:54,474 --> 00:48:57,644
I can't talk about it anymore.
It's giving me a headache.

903
00:48:58,395 --> 00:49:00,397
Here. Take two of these.

904
00:49:03,108 --> 00:49:06,236
Ah, Nuprin. Little. Yellow. Different.

905
00:49:07,446 --> 00:49:10,866
Look. You can stay here
in the big leagues and play by the rules,

906
00:49:10,949 --> 00:49:13,202
or you can
go back to the farm club in Aurora.

907
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:14,870
- It's your choice.
- Yes,

908
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:16,955

- Yeah, I know what you'd like to do.

rip his still-beating heart out of
his chest, and hold it in front of his face

920

Americans, of course,
don't recognize the convention,

Mr. Vanderhoff's very excited.
I'm very excited.

1043

I mean, I think the show's gonna be a
huge hit all over the Chicago land area.

Look, I want you and Garth
to have these.

1045

It's two tickets to Alice Cooper's concert
tomorrow night in Milwaukee.

Well, I'm a regular visitor here,

1152
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:43,446
but Milwaukee has certainly had
its share of visitors.

1153
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:45,239
The French missionaries and explorers

1154
01:03:45,323 --> 01:03:47,366
were coming here
as early as the late 1600s

1155
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:49,327
to trade with the Native Americans.

1156
01:03:49,410 --> 01:03:51,704
In fact, isn't Milwaukee an Indian name?

1157
01:03:51,788 --> 01:03:53,206
Yes, Pete, it is.

1158
01:03:53,289 --> 01:03:55,625
Actually, it's pronounced
"mee-lee-wa-kay,"

1159
01:03:55,708 --> 01:03:58,503
which is Algonquin
for "The Good Land."

1160
01:03:58,878 --> 01:04:00,755
I was not aware of that.

1161
01:04:00,838 --> 01:04:03,091
I think one of the most
interesting aspects of Milwaukee

1162
01:04:03,174 --> 01:04:06,094
is the fact that it's
the only major American city

1163
01:04:06,177 --> 01:04:08,679
to have ever elected
three socialist mayors.

1164

01:14:20,958 --> 01:14:22,376
Okay, I suppose.

1381
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:24,461
Just wish I had Cassandra back.

1382
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:28,090
She's in Chicago
shooting a video with Benjamin.

1383
01:14:28,632 --> 01:14:29,633
So...

1384
01:14:30,634 --> 01:14:32,219
What are you going to do?

1385
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:33,554
I don't know.

1386
01:14:33,846 --> 01:14:35,681
I do have one plan.

1387
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:41,353
What are you gonna do
with these guys?

1388
01:14:41,437 --> 01:14:43,188
WAYNE: Oh, nothing, really.

1389
01:14:45,691 --> 01:14:47,943
I just always wanted
to open a door to a room

1390
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:51,613
where people are being trained,
like in James Bond movies.

1391
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:53,323
- Wicked.
- Yeah.

1392
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:02,207
I think you should
just go get Cassandra.

1393
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:04,918
I just don't think she wants me to.

1394
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:09,506
Let me tell you a little something
I've learned about women.

1395
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:12,426
They want you to come get them.

1396
01:15:17,014 --> 01:15:18,515
They love it.

1397
01:15:20,476 --> 01:15:22,352
I just wish there was something
that I could offer her

1398
01:15:22,436 --> 01:15:24,271
that Benjamin couldn't.

1399
01:15:24,354 --> 01:15:26,482
You'll think of something.

1400
01:15:27,149 --> 01:15:28,692
Wait a minute.

1401
01:15:29,026 --> 01:15:30,068
No.

1402
01:15:30,527 --> 01:15:32,196
Wait a minute.

1403
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:33,530
No.

1404
01:15:33,614 --> 01:15:34,782
Wait a minute!

1405
01:15:34,865 --> 01:15:37,284
I know, the guy in the limo, Mr. Big,

1406
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:39,703
the guy who owns Sharp Records.

1407
01:15:39,787 --> 01:15:42,790
If there's only a way that we could
get him to listen to Cassandra play.

1408
01:15:42,873 --> 01:15:44,291
Hold it, hold it.

1409
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,668
You remember the security guard
at the concert?

1410
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:49,963
He said Mr. Sharp was driving
back through Chicago on Friday!

1411
01:15:50,047 --> 01:15:52,174
That's right. Wow.

1412
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:55,969
Aren't we lucky we were there
to get all that information?

1413
01:15:56,053 --> 01:15:58,138
It seemed extraneous at the time.

1414
01:15:58,263 --> 01:16:01,934
Okay, first I'll access
the secret military spy satellite

1415
01:16:02,017 --> 01:16:04,394
that's in a geosynchronous orbit
over the Midwest.

1416
01:16:04,478 --> 01:16:07,648
Then I'll ID the limo
by the vanity plate "Mr. Biggg"

1417
01:16:07,731 --> 01:16:10,275
-and get its approximate position.
- Yes.

1418
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,486
Then I'll reposition the transmitter dish

1419
01:16:12,569 --> 01:16:15,614
in the remote truck
to 17.32 degrees East,

1420
01:16:16,031 --> 01:16:17,282
hit Westar IV over the Atlantic,

1421
01:16:17,366 --> 01:16:19,993
bounce the signal down into the Azores,
up to comtech six,

1422
01:16:20,077 --> 01:16:23,205
beam it back to Satcom III,
transponder number 137,

1423
01:16:23,288 --> 01:16:26,667
and down to the dish
on the back of Mr. Big's limo.

1424
01:16:27,125 --> 01:16:29,044
It's almost too easy.

1425
01:16:30,754 --> 01:16:33,799
We can only pray
he's watching television in his limo

1426
01:16:33,882 --> 01:16:35,551
at that exact moment.

1427
01:16:35,759 --> 01:16:37,219
We'll need help.

1428

- We'll help.

I saw your performance in my limo.

1595

I must say,
I've seen a lot of acts in my day,

1596
01:27:02,010 --> 01:27:04,220
and although you're extremely beautiful,

1597

I just think it's the wrong time.

1598
01:27:07,098 --> 01:27:08,516
- I'm sorry.
- Bummer, man.

You screwed my career!

I always knew you were small-time.

Wayne, I'm pregnant,
that's why I've been so moody.

Whoa!

As if.

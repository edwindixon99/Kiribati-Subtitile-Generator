1
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:36,232
- Hello?
- Hello.

2
00:00:36,315 --> 00:00:38,734
- Yes?
- Who is this?

3
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:41,820
- Who you trying to reach?
- What number is this?

4
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:44,823
- What number are you trying to reach?
- I don't know.

5
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:47,326
- I think you have the wrong number.
- Do I?

6
00:00:47,409 --> 00:00:49,828
It happens. Take it easy.

7
00:00:58,087 --> 00:01:01,507
- Hello!
- I'm sorry. I guess
I dialed the wrong number.

8
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,010
- So, why'd you dial it again?
- To apologize.

9
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:08,764
- You're forgiven. Bye, now.
- Wait, wait! Don't hang up.

10
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:11,183
- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.

11
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:14,353
They've got 900-numbers
for that. See ya.

12
00:01:35,666 --> 00:01:38,377
- Hello.
- Why don't you want to talk to me?

13
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,506
- Who is this?
- You tell me your name,
I'll tell you mine.

14
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,509
- I don't think so.

15
00:01:45,593 --> 00:01:47,845
- What's that noise?
- Popcorn.

16
00:01:47,928 --> 00:01:49,847
- You're making popcorn?
- Uh-huh.

17
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:52,141
I only eat popcorn
at the movies.

18
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:55,519
- Well, I'm getting ready
to watch a video.
- Really? What?

19
00:01:55,603 --> 00:01:57,605
Oh, just some scary movie.

20
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:59,982
- You like scary movies?
- Uh-huh.

21
00:02:00,024 --> 00:02:02,109
What's your favorite
scary movie?

22
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:05,070
- Uh, I don't know.
- You have to have a favorite.

23
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:07,072
What comes to mind?

24
00:02:07,156 --> 00:02:09,074
Um..."Halloween."

25
00:02:09,158 --> 00:02:11,493
You know, the one with the guy
in the white mask...

26
00:02:11,577 --> 00:02:14,455
who walks around
and stalks baby-sitters.

27
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:16,457
- Yeah.
- What's yours?

28
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:20,961
- Guess.
- Um..."Nightmare on Elm Street."

29
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:23,797
Is that the one where
the guy had knives for fingers?

30
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:26,300
- Yeah, Freddy Krueger.
- Freddy, that's right.

31
00:02:26,342 --> 00:02:29,011
I liked that movie.
It was scary.

32
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:31,639
Yeah, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.

33
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,682
So, you got a boyfriend?

34
00:02:33,724 --> 00:02:36,977
Why? You wanna ask me
out on a date?

35
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,605
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

36
00:02:39,688 --> 00:02:42,858
- Mm... no.
- You never told me your name.

37
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:44,860
Why do you want
to know my name?

38
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:48,322
'Cause I wanna know
who I'm looking at.

39
00:02:48,364 --> 00:02:53,160
- What did you say?
- I wanna know who I'm talking to.

40
00:02:53,202 --> 00:02:56,163
- That's not what you said.
- What do you think I said?

41
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,334
What?

42
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:03,546
Hello?

43
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:05,840
Look, I gotta go.

44
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:07,842
Wait! I thought we
were gonna go out.

45
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,219
Uh, nah, I don't think so.

46
00:03:10,302 --> 00:03:12,221
Don't hang up on me!

47
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:22,898
Shit.

48
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:26,694
- Yes?
- I told you not to hang up on me.

49
00:03:26,735 --> 00:03:28,863
- What do you want?
- To talk.

50
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:31,574
Well, dial someone else, okay?

51
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,919
- Listen, asshole!
- No, you listen, you little bitch!

52
00:03:44,003 --> 00:03:48,215
You hang up on me again,
I'll cut you like a fish, understand?

53
00:03:48,257 --> 00:03:50,801
Yeah.

54
00:03:50,885 --> 00:03:52,803
Is this some kind of joke?

55
00:03:52,887 --> 00:03:55,306
More of a game, really.

56
00:03:56,891 --> 00:04:00,060
Can you handle that...

57
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:02,563
blondie?

58
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:14,617
Can you see me?

59
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,166
Listen, I am two seconds away
from calling the police.

60
00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:26,462
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

61
00:04:26,545 --> 00:04:31,592
- What do you want?
- To see what your insides look like.

62
00:04:39,934 --> 00:04:43,437
Who's there?
Who's there?

63
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:46,524
- I'm calling the police.

64
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:51,278
You should never say,
"Who's there?"

65
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,781
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.

66
00:04:53,822 --> 00:04:58,452
You might as well just
come out here to investigate
a strange noise or somethin'.

67
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:01,956
Look, you've had
your fun now...

68
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:05,584
- so I think you better
just leave or else.
- Or else what?

69
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:10,297
Or else my boyfriend'll
be here any second, and he'll
be pissed when he finds out.

70
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:12,299
I thought you didn't
have a boyfriend.

71
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:16,220
I lied! I do have a boyfriend,
and he'll be here any second...

72
00:05:16,303 --> 00:05:19,348
- so your ass better be gone.
- Sure.

73
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:21,892
I swear.

74
00:05:21,976 --> 00:05:26,856
He's big, and he plays football
and he'll kick the shit out of you!

75
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:30,150
I'm getting scared.
I'm shaking in my boots.

76
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:32,653
So you better just leave.

77
00:05:32,695 --> 00:05:34,655
His name wouldn't be...

78
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:37,658
Steve, would it?

79
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,661
How do you know his name?

80
00:05:40,703 --> 00:05:44,665
Turn on the patio lights... again.

81
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:58,846
Oh, God!

82
00:05:58,888 --> 00:06:02,600
- I wouldn't
do that if I were you.
- Where are you?

83
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:04,727
- Guess.
- Please don't hurt him.

84
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,438
- That all depends on you.
- Why are you doing this?

85
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:09,982
- I wanna play a game.
- No.

86
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:12,651
- Then he dies right now!
- No! No!

87
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:17,239
Which is it?
Which is it?

88
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:21,243
Wha... What kind of game?

89
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:26,040
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.

90
00:06:26,081 --> 00:06:28,042
Just do it!

91
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:33,172
Casey! No! No!

92
00:06:33,255 --> 00:06:35,299
No! Casey!

93
00:06:35,382 --> 00:06:37,301
Here's how we play.

94
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:41,722
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.

95
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:44,099
- Please don't do this.
- Come on. It'll be fun.

96
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:46,185
- Please...
- It's an easy category.

97
00:06:46,268 --> 00:06:48,187
- Please...
- Movie trivia.

98
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:51,106
- I'll even give you
a warm-up question.
- Don't do this. I can't.

99
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,610
- Name the killer in "Halloween."
- No.

100
00:06:54,693 --> 00:06:57,613
Come on! It's your favorite
scary movie, remember?

101
00:06:57,696 --> 00:07:00,950
- He had a white mask;
he stalked the baby-sitters.
- I don't know.

102
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:03,953
- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.

103
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:07,248
- What's his name?
- I can't think.

104
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:09,792
Steve's counting on you.

105
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,920
Michael...
Michael, Michael.

106
00:07:12,962 --> 00:07:15,548
Yes! Very good.

107
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:17,550
Now for the real question.

108
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,969
- No!
- But you're doing so well.

109
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:23,472
- We can't stop now.
- Please stop! Leave us alone!

110
00:07:23,514 --> 00:07:26,600
Answer the question.
Same category.

111
00:07:26,642 --> 00:07:29,603
Oh, please stop.

112
00:07:29,645 --> 00:07:32,773
Name the killer
in "Friday the 13th."

113
00:07:32,815 --> 00:07:35,484
Jason! Jason, Jason!

114
00:07:35,568 --> 00:07:38,612
I'm sorry.
That's the wrong answer.

115
00:07:38,696 --> 00:07:42,157
No, it's not! No, it's not.
It was Jason.

116
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:44,451
Afraid not. No way.

117
00:07:44,493 --> 00:07:48,455
Listen, it was Jason!
I saw that movie 20 goddamn times!

118
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,667
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs. Voorhees, was the original killer.

119
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,044
Jason didn't show up
until the sequel.

120
00:07:54,128 --> 00:07:57,006
I'm afraid that was
a wrong answer.

121
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:59,008
You tricked me.

122
00:07:59,049 --> 00:08:01,093
Lucky for you
there's a bonus round.

123
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:04,930
But poor Steve.
I'm afraid he's out!

124
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:33,292
Hey, we're not finished yet.

125
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:37,922
Final question.
Are you ready?

126
00:08:38,005 --> 00:08:42,176
Please,
please, leave me alone.

127
00:08:42,218 --> 00:08:44,178
Answer the question, and I will.

128
00:08:45,554 --> 00:08:48,974
What door am I at?

129
00:08:49,058 --> 00:08:52,645
- What?
- There are two main doors to your house.

130
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:54,647
The front door,
the patio doors.

131
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,649
If you answer correctly, you live.

132
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:58,943
Very simple.

133
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:02,112
Don't do this.
I can't; I won't.

134
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:04,740
Your call.

135
00:10:32,453 --> 00:10:34,455
- Aah!

136
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:30,511
Did you water over here today?

137
00:11:30,553 --> 00:11:33,055
- It was just that water from the rain.
- They look great, don't they?

138
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:36,058
- Don't they smell strong?
- I told you you could send it back.

139
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:41,689
Mom!

140
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,024
- Jesus!
- What is it?

141
00:11:57,872 --> 00:11:59,874
Casey!

142
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:05,629
Oh, G...

143
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:09,592
Casey. Casey.

144
00:12:09,675 --> 00:12:11,594
Casey!

145
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:15,973
- Where is she?
- Call the police!

146
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,189
- Casey!

147
00:12:23,272 --> 00:12:26,108
- Casey, are you upstairs?
- Oh, my God. Casey, baby?

148
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:28,110
- Casey?
- She's here.

149
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:30,613
- Mom.
- Oh, my God,
I can hear her.

150
00:12:30,696 --> 00:12:34,074
- Mom.
- Where is she?

151
00:12:36,118 --> 00:12:38,078
Oh, my God!
I can hear her.

152
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,080
- Hey!

153
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:46,754
Get in the car.
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.

154
00:12:46,795 --> 00:12:50,174
- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.

155
00:12:50,257 --> 00:12:52,176
- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.

156
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:37,263
- It's just me.

157
00:13:37,346 --> 00:13:40,349
- Billy, what are you doing here?
- Sorry, don't hate me.

158
00:13:40,432 --> 00:13:42,726
- You sleep in that?
- Yes, I sleep in this.

159
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:44,728
My dad is in the other room.
You can't be in here.

160
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:47,147
- I'll just stay a sec.

161
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:49,275
No... You gotta go. Go, go, go.

162
00:13:49,358 --> 00:13:51,485
What's going on in there?

163
00:13:51,527 --> 00:13:53,487
- Are you okay?
- Can you knock?

164
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:55,406
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.

165
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:57,783
No?

166
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:00,953
Oh, well.
I'm hitting the sack.

167
00:14:01,036 --> 00:14:03,497
My flight leaves
first thing in the morning.

168
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:06,625
Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back 'til Sunday.

169
00:14:06,709 --> 00:14:10,004
- There's cash on the table,
and I'm staying at...
- The Hilton.

170
00:14:10,045 --> 00:14:12,965
- Out at the airport, so call if...
- I need anything.

171
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:16,051
I could've sworn
I heard screaming.

172
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:18,179
Have a good trip, okay?

173
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,181
Sleep tight, sweetie.

174
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:26,729
Oh... close call.

175
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:29,607
Billy, what're you doing here?

176
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,609
It occurred to me that...

177
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:33,861
- I've never snuck through
your bedroom window.
- Shh, shh, shh.

178
00:14:33,944 --> 00:14:36,614
Great idea, now that
it's out of your system.

179
00:14:36,697 --> 00:14:38,616
I was home watching television.

180
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:41,160
"The," uh,
"The Exorcist" was on.

181
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:45,080
- It got me thinking of you.
- It did?

182
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:49,001
Yeah, it was edited for TV. You know,
all the good stuff was cut out.

183
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:53,380
And it got me thinking of us...

184
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:57,051
how two years ago
we started off hot and heavy.

185
00:14:57,092 --> 00:15:01,013
Nice solid R-rating
on our way to an NC-17.

186
00:15:02,515 --> 00:15:05,976
And now... things have changed and...

187
00:15:11,106 --> 00:15:14,485
lately we're just sort of
edited for television.

188
00:15:14,568 --> 00:15:18,948
Oh, so you thought
you would climb in my window...

189
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:22,159
- and we'd have a little raw footage?
- No.

190
00:15:22,243 --> 00:15:26,413
No, I wouldn't dream of breaking
your underwear rule.

191
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:31,418
I just thought maybe we could do
a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.

192
00:15:34,171 --> 00:15:38,342
- Okay.
- Yeah?

193
00:15:38,425 --> 00:15:40,344
Yeah.

194
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:44,348
If we ever fly away

195
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:48,811
Baby, I'm with you

196
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:53,732
Baby, I'm your man

197
00:15:53,816 --> 00:15:55,734
Hey.

198
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:05,786
La, la, la, la
la, la, la

199
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:14,128
Okay. Okay, okay.
Time is up, stud-muffin.

200
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:17,131
God, you see what
you do to me?

201
00:16:17,173 --> 00:16:20,634
You know what
my dad'll do to you?

202
00:16:21,177 --> 00:16:23,137
Yeah.

203
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:26,140
- I'm going.
- Okay.

204
00:16:29,518 --> 00:16:32,438
Romeo and Juliet

205
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:35,357
Are together in eternity

206
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:38,027
You know, l... I appreciate
the romantic gesture.

207
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,029
So, come on, baby

208
00:16:40,112 --> 00:16:43,949
Hey, about the, uh,
the sex stuff?

209
00:16:44,033 --> 00:16:46,702
I'm not trying
to rush you at all.

210
00:16:46,785 --> 00:16:49,205
I was only half serious.

211
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:51,665
Okay.

212
00:16:51,707 --> 00:16:54,960
Baby, I'm your man

213
00:16:56,253 --> 00:16:59,632
Baby, I'm your man

214
00:16:59,715 --> 00:17:01,634
Hey, Billy.

215
00:17:01,717 --> 00:17:05,971
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

216
00:17:06,055 --> 00:17:08,724
What's that?

217
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:14,271
- La, la, la-la, la

218
00:17:14,355 --> 00:17:18,234
My God. You're just a tease.

219
00:17:25,241 --> 00:17:28,327
Thirty-five...

220
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:31,080
Situation under control.

221
00:17:31,163 --> 00:17:34,083
Roger, dispatch.

222
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,919
There's blood found?
All right.

223
00:17:52,101 --> 00:17:55,187
...are doing drugs they buy
in the classrooms...

224
00:17:55,271 --> 00:17:57,690
and that they are
involved in the occult.

225
00:17:57,773 --> 00:17:59,984
Occult?

226
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:03,112
Woodsboro, California,
was devastated last night...

227
00:18:03,195 --> 00:18:05,948
when two young teenagers
were found brutally murdered.

228
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:08,158
Authorities have yet
to issue a statement...

229
00:18:08,242 --> 00:18:11,662
but our sources tell us
that no arrest has been made...

230
00:18:11,745 --> 00:18:13,664
- and the murderer could strike again.
- Do you believe this shit?

231
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:16,876
- Damn! What is going on?
- You don't know?

232
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:20,546
Casey Becker and Steve Orth
were killed last night.

233
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:22,548
What? No way.

234
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:25,050
And we're not just talking killed;
we're talking splatter-movie killed.

235
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:27,136
Ripped open from end to end.

236
00:18:27,219 --> 00:18:29,763
Casey Becker, she sits
next to me in English.

237
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:31,765
Not anymore.
It's so sad.

238
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:34,143
Her mom and dad, they found her
hanging from a tree...

239
00:18:34,185 --> 00:18:37,104
- her insides on the outside.
- Oh, my God!

240
00:18:37,146 --> 00:18:39,106
Do they know who did it?

241
00:18:39,148 --> 00:18:42,484
Fucking clueless.
They're interrogating the entire school.

242
00:18:42,526 --> 00:18:45,029
- Teachers, students, janitors.
- They think it's school-related?

243
00:18:45,112 --> 00:18:49,033
They don't know.
Dewey was saying this is
the worst crime they've seen in years.

244
00:18:49,116 --> 00:18:51,035
- Even worse than...

245
00:18:51,118 --> 00:18:53,787
Well... it's bad.

246
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:02,463
- Here you go, Mrs. Tate.
- Thank you, James.

247
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:06,967
Sidney.

248
00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:09,386
It would appear to be your turn.

249
00:19:13,641 --> 00:19:17,186
- Who's up next?
- Uh, Sidney Prescott.

250
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:19,980
She was daughter of, uh...

251
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:23,943
- Sidney, how you feelin'?
- Fine.

252
00:19:24,026 --> 00:19:26,320
Hi, Sidney.

253
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:27,905
Sheriff Burke, Dewey.

254
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:31,659
Uh, that's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

255
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,120
- How is everything?
- Good.

256
00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:37,289
And your dad?
How's he doin'?

257
00:19:37,373 --> 00:19:41,252
- We're fine. Thanks.
- We're gonna keep this
very brief, Sidney.

258
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:44,004
The police just want to ask you
a few questions. You okay?

259
00:19:44,046 --> 00:19:45,422
Mm-hmm.

260
00:19:45,506 --> 00:19:48,759
Sidney, were you
very close to Casey Becker?

261
00:19:48,843 --> 00:19:52,429
Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.

262
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:56,183
All students are encouraged to return
home promptly from school grounds.

263
00:19:56,225 --> 00:19:58,269
Avoid strangers;
walk in twos and threes.

264
00:19:58,352 --> 00:20:00,271
What kind of questions
did they ask you, Sidney?

265
00:20:00,354 --> 00:20:02,523
- They asked if I knew Casey.
- They asked me that too.

266
00:20:02,606 --> 00:20:05,067
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did.

267
00:20:05,109 --> 00:20:07,069
Did they ask you?

268
00:20:07,111 --> 00:20:09,113
Why would they ask you
if you liked to hunt?

269
00:20:09,196 --> 00:20:11,615
'Cause their bodies were gutted.

270
00:20:11,699 --> 00:20:14,910
- Thank you, Randy.
- They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

271
00:20:14,994 --> 00:20:18,038
- 'Cause there's no way
a girl could've killed 'em.
- That is so sexist.

272
00:20:18,122 --> 00:20:20,749
The killer could easily be female.
"Basic Instinct."

273
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,169
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.

274
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:25,754
Yeah, Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.

275
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:28,382
And the fact is, it takes a man
to do something like that.

276
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:30,384
Or a man's mentality.

277
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:32,928
How do you... gut someone?

278
00:20:36,265 --> 00:20:40,769
You take a knife, and you slit 'em
from the groin to sternum.

279
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:44,607
Hey, it's called tact,
you fuck rag.

280
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:46,859
Hey, Stu, didn't you
used to date Casey?

281
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:50,946
- Yeah, for like two seconds.
- Before she
dumped him for Steve.

282
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,948
I thought you
dumped her for me.

283
00:20:53,032 --> 00:20:56,368
- I did. He's full of shit.
- And are the police aware
that you dated the victim?

284
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:59,580
Hey, what're you saying?
That I killed her?

285
00:20:59,622 --> 00:21:01,624
It would certainly improve
your high school "Q."

286
00:21:01,707 --> 00:21:05,544
- Stu was with me last night, okay?
- Yeah, I was.

287
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:09,173
Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?

288
00:21:09,256 --> 00:21:11,300
Fuck you, nutcase.
Where were you last night?

289
00:21:11,383 --> 00:21:15,221
- Working, thank you.
- At the video store?
I thought they fired your ass.

290
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:17,264
Twice.

291
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:21,185
- I didn't kill anybody.
- Nobody said you did.

292
00:21:21,268 --> 00:21:22,937
Thanks, buddy.

293
00:21:22,978 --> 00:21:28,067
Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.

294
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:31,237
- I'm gonna gut your ass
in a second, kid.
- Tell me something.

295
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,739
Did you really put
her liver in the mailbox?

296
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:37,701
'Cause I heard that they
found her liver in the mailbox
next to her spleen and pancreas.

297
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:39,787
You goon! Fuck!
I'm trying to eat here.

298
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,956
She's getting mad, all right?

299
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,999
You better "liver" alone.

300
00:21:46,794 --> 00:21:49,797
"Liver" alone!

301
00:21:52,508 --> 00:21:56,053
"Liv..." Ow!
"Liver. Liver." It was a joke.

302
00:22:01,684 --> 00:22:04,812
See you, Sidney.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.

303
00:22:27,042 --> 00:22:31,463
So, you're sure I can stay over,
'cause my dad won't be back 'til Sunday.

304
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:33,757
No problem.
I'll pick you up after practice.

305
00:22:35,342 --> 00:22:37,261
You okay?

306
00:22:37,344 --> 00:22:39,763
Uh-huh. It's just...

307
00:22:39,847 --> 00:22:41,765
you know, the police
and the reporters...

308
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:43,767
it's like déjà vu
all over again.

309
00:22:43,851 --> 00:22:46,145
I'll be there by 7:00.
I promise.

310
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:48,647
- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.

311
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:38,572
The bodies of 17-year-old
Casey Becker...

312
00:23:38,614 --> 00:23:40,574
and her 18-year-old boyfriend,
Steven Orth...

313
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:42,576
were discovered late last night
by the girl's parents...

314
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:44,703
The Woodsboro double murder case.

315
00:23:44,787 --> 00:23:47,748
Authorities are baffled
by the lack of clues and the savage...

316
00:23:47,831 --> 00:23:51,377
The town's in shock, and no one can
quite believe what has happened here...

317
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:54,171
although this is not the first time
this small community...

318
00:23:54,255 --> 00:23:57,258
of Woodsboro
has endured such tragedy.

319
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,301
Only a year ago
Maureen Prescott, wife and mother...

320
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:03,848
was found raped and murdered
not far from this peaceful town square.

321
00:25:14,335 --> 00:25:18,255
- Hello?
- Practice ran late.
I'm on my way, okay?

322
00:25:20,174 --> 00:25:22,092
It's past 7:00.

323
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:25,095
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't
bite it 'til way after 10:00.

324
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:28,015
Oh. Oh, that's comforting.

325
00:25:28,057 --> 00:25:30,017
I'm gonna swing by
the video store.

326
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:32,019
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise,
"All The Right Moves."

327
00:25:32,061 --> 00:25:34,939
If you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.

328
00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:37,942
- Whatever. Just hurry, okay?
- Ta-ta, Sid.

329
00:25:48,786 --> 00:25:52,957
- Tatum, just get in the car...
- Hello, Sidney.

330
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,794
Uh... hi, who is this?

331
00:25:56,877 --> 00:26:00,464
You tell me.

332
00:26:00,548 --> 00:26:02,967
Well, I-I have no idea.

333
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:04,969
Scary night, isn't it?

334
00:26:05,052 --> 00:26:09,849
With the murders and all,
it's like right out of
a horror movie or something.

335
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:12,476
Randy, you gave yourself away.

336
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,770
Are you calling from work,
'cause Tatum's on her way over.

337
00:26:14,854 --> 00:26:18,357
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

338
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,485
I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

339
00:26:21,569 --> 00:26:24,238
What's your favorite scary movie?

340
00:26:24,321 --> 00:26:26,490
Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.

341
00:26:26,574 --> 00:26:29,118
- Why not? Too scared?
- No. No.

342
00:26:29,201 --> 00:26:31,245
It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.

343
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:34,456
Some stupid killer stalking
some big-breasted girl who can't act...

344
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,459
who's always running up the stairs when
she should be going out the front door.

345
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:41,463
- It's insulting.
- Are you alone in the house?

346
00:26:41,505 --> 00:26:44,091
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

347
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:47,469
Maybe that's because
I'm not Randy.

348
00:26:54,602 --> 00:26:56,520
So, who are you?

349
00:26:56,604 --> 00:26:58,606
The question isn't
"Who am I?"

350
00:26:58,689 --> 00:27:02,151
The question is
"Where am I?"

351
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:06,280
S-S-So, where are you?

352
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:08,324
Your front porch.

353
00:27:12,661 --> 00:27:15,080
Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

354
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:17,082
That's the original part.

355
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:20,753
Oh, yeah?

356
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,425
Well, I call your bluff.

357
00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:42,107
- So, where are you?
- Right here.

358
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,184
- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh.

359
00:28:17,226 --> 00:28:19,186
Uh-huh, okay.

360
00:28:19,228 --> 00:28:22,231
What am I doin'? Huh?

361
00:28:22,273 --> 00:28:25,734
Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!

362
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:28,988
Nice try, Randy.

363
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:31,407
Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay?
Bye now.

364
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:34,076
If you hang up on me,
you'll die just like your mother!

365
00:28:35,411 --> 00:28:40,875
Do you wanna die, Sidney?
Your mother sure didn't.

366
00:28:42,042 --> 00:28:44,044
Fuck you, you cretin!

367
00:29:13,741 --> 00:29:15,075
No!

368
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,941
Shit!

369
00:30:01,247 --> 00:30:03,832
Billy!

370
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:06,085
The door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?

371
00:30:06,168 --> 00:30:08,087
The killer's here.
He's in the house.

372
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:11,048
He's in the house.
He's got a knife.

373
00:30:11,131 --> 00:30:13,717
He's gone.
He's gone.

374
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:15,719
It's all right.

375
00:30:25,688 --> 00:30:27,648
What?

376
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,863
Sid, what?

377
00:30:35,197 --> 00:30:37,116
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Wait, Sidney, wait!

378
00:30:37,199 --> 00:30:40,703
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What's going on?

379
00:30:40,786 --> 00:30:44,290
Sidney, come back! Sidney!

380
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,673
Sorry! I found this. Come on!

381
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:54,675
All right, hold your hands together.

382
00:30:54,717 --> 00:30:57,678
- Do you wish to give up
your right to remain silent?
- I didn't do anything.

383
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,680
Do you wish to give up
your right to speak to an attorney...

384
00:30:59,722 --> 00:31:01,682
- And have them present
during questioning?

385
00:31:01,724 --> 00:31:05,686
Ask her. She'll tell you.

386
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,855
- I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait. Who is that?

387
00:31:07,897 --> 00:31:11,358
- Billy Loomis.
- Sheriff, Sheriff, call these guys off.

388
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,528
I didn't do it.
Sheriff, wait.

389
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,530
Wait, listen.
Call my dad.

390
00:31:16,572 --> 00:31:18,949
Please, call him.
He'll tell you. Call him.

391
00:31:19,033 --> 00:31:22,453
Sidney! Sidney!

392
00:31:22,536 --> 00:31:24,580
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.

393
00:31:24,663 --> 00:31:27,583
She'd have to be,
all the shit she's been through.

394
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:31,086
- Sid!
- Well, we're seein' a lot of you today.

395
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:34,965
You gonna be able to come
down to the station and answer
a few questions, Sid?

396
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:36,967
Oh, shit! Sidney!

397
00:31:37,051 --> 00:31:39,220
God, Sid, I'm so sorry I was late.
Are you all right?

398
00:31:39,303 --> 00:31:41,263
Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.

399
00:31:41,305 --> 00:31:45,017
- It's okay.
- Her dad's out of town.
She's staying with us.

400
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:47,019
Does Mom know?

401
00:31:47,102 --> 00:31:49,522
- Yes, doofus.
- Let's get you out of here.

402
00:31:49,605 --> 00:31:51,524
- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.

403
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:53,526
Oh, you won't believe this.

404
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:58,989
Creepy, huh?

405
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,959
- I'll be damned.
- What?

406
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:12,962
- Jesus! The camera, hurry!
- My name isn't Jesus.

407
00:32:14,922 --> 00:32:16,841
Sidney, is that you in there?

408
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:18,843
Excuse me. Is that Sidney Prescott
they took away?

409
00:32:18,926 --> 00:32:20,845
- I'm not talking to you.
- What happened to her?

410
00:32:20,928 --> 00:32:24,306
- None of your damned business.
- I heard something about
a costume. Is that true?

411
00:32:24,348 --> 00:32:28,435
- Can you tell me anything?
- Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.

412
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:30,980
Leave Sid alone.

413
00:32:31,021 --> 00:32:32,982
Where's she goin'?

414
00:32:34,024 --> 00:32:36,777
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?

415
00:32:36,861 --> 00:32:39,154
I know that you're about
50 pounds overweight...

416
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:41,156
but when I say "hurry,"

417
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:45,995
please interpret that as
"move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!"

418
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:50,666
Did you find him?

419
00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:53,711
You sure it was the Hilton?

420
00:32:53,794 --> 00:32:58,507
- At the airport.
- He's not registered there.

421
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:02,845
Could he have stayed
somewhere else?

422
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:06,098
I don't know. I guess.

423
00:33:06,182 --> 00:33:08,434
Don't worry, Sid.

424
00:33:08,517 --> 00:33:11,937
- We'll find him.
- Dewey, they got that mask in.

425
00:33:13,522 --> 00:33:15,441
I'll be right back.

426
00:33:23,324 --> 00:33:27,870
Let me ask you this. What're you doin'
with a cellular telephone, son?

427
00:33:27,953 --> 00:33:29,872
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

428
00:33:29,955 --> 00:33:33,167
I didn't make those calls, I swear.

429
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:35,169
Check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake.

430
00:33:35,211 --> 00:33:37,505
Call Vital Phone Comp. They got
the records of every number dialed.

431
00:33:37,546 --> 00:33:40,466
Thanks, Hank.
We're on top of it.

432
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:43,219
What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?

433
00:33:43,302 --> 00:33:45,804
I wanted to see her, that's all.

434
00:33:45,888 --> 00:33:49,642
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night too.

435
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:52,061
You went out last night?

436
00:33:52,102 --> 00:33:56,690
I was watching TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.

437
00:33:56,732 --> 00:33:59,568
Did you happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

438
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:03,697
No, I didn't. Sheriff,
I didn't kill anybody!

439
00:34:09,036 --> 00:34:12,122
We're gonna have to hold you, son,
'til we get those phone records.

440
00:34:15,084 --> 00:34:17,545
That's crazy.

441
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:21,674
You know that?
I didn't do it.

442
00:34:32,017 --> 00:34:34,144
Camera Two? Okay.

443
00:34:34,228 --> 00:34:36,480
Are there anymore
doughnuts in there?

444
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:39,525
- Move it, Kenny.
- They're not lettin' anybody in.

445
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:42,528
- I'm not just anyone.
- Bitch goddess.

446
00:34:42,611 --> 00:34:44,530
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.

447
00:34:44,613 --> 00:34:47,032
Hi, Gale Weathers reporting live
from Woodsboro police station...

448
00:34:47,116 --> 00:34:49,118
where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.

449
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:53,163
- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Hey, watch the hand! Do you
know who you're dealing with?

450
00:34:53,247 --> 00:34:56,208
Tell 'em.
Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!

451
00:34:56,292 --> 00:34:58,294
- He's waiting for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!

452
00:34:58,377 --> 00:35:00,588
Sidney, come on.
You know me.

453
00:35:00,671 --> 00:35:03,465
Sidney, look at me!

454
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:05,968
Come on!

455
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:14,310
Sid, we're gonna get you
out of here, okay? Are you okay?

456
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,857
They sell this costume
at every five-and-dime in the state.

457
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,610
There's no way
to track the purchase.

458
00:35:22,651 --> 00:35:24,945
What about that cellular
phone bill?

459
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:28,782
We're pulling Loomis's account.
We won't know anything
until the morning.

460
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:32,244
Oh, come on!

461
00:35:32,328 --> 00:35:36,040
- You think he did it?
- Twenty years ago,
I would've said, "Not a chance."

462
00:35:36,123 --> 00:35:40,920
But these kids today...
damned if I know.

463
00:35:41,003 --> 00:35:44,215
- Hey, Dewey, can we go now?
- Hold on a second.

464
00:35:44,298 --> 00:35:47,676
- Goddamn it, Dewey!
- What did Mama tell you?

465
00:35:47,718 --> 00:35:50,346
When I wear this badge,
you treat me like a man of the law!

466
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:52,640
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy,
but we're ready to go.

467
00:35:52,681 --> 00:35:55,684
- Now, okay?
- Whoa.

468
00:35:55,768 --> 00:35:59,730
Take 'em out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

469
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:02,733
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

470
00:36:02,816 --> 00:36:06,237
- He's my superior.
- Janitors are your superior.

471
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:10,616
Let's get back to work!

472
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:19,124
- Isn't there a back way
out of this building?
- Yeah.

473
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,627
Down that alley, I think.

474
00:36:24,505 --> 00:36:27,424
You guys just stay here.
I'm gonna get the car.

475
00:36:27,508 --> 00:36:29,426
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.

476
00:36:31,178 --> 00:36:34,181
There she is. Sidney!

477
00:36:34,223 --> 00:36:37,393
Hi, that's some night.
What happened? Are you all right?

478
00:36:37,476 --> 00:36:39,854
She's not answering any questions.
Just leave us alone.

479
00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:42,356
No, Tatum, it's okay.
She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?

480
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:45,860
- Yes, that's right.
- So, how's the book?

481
00:36:45,901 --> 00:36:47,903
Well, it'll be out
later this year.

482
00:36:47,987 --> 00:36:50,281
Oh, I'll look for it.

483
00:36:50,364 --> 00:36:53,242
I'll send you a copy.

484
00:36:53,325 --> 00:36:55,494
Jeez.

485
00:36:55,578 --> 00:36:58,122
- Nice shot.
- Bitch.

486
00:36:58,205 --> 00:37:01,292
- No, I mean, camera shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?

487
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:04,295
God, I loved it.
"I'll send you a copy."

488
00:37:04,378 --> 00:37:06,297
Bam! Bitch went down.

489
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,551
"I'll send you a copy."
Bam! Sid... Superbitch!

490
00:37:10,634 --> 00:37:12,595
You are so cool.

491
00:37:12,636 --> 00:37:14,930
Thought you might want
some ice for that right hook.

492
00:37:15,014 --> 00:37:17,183
Thanks.

493
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:20,936
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

494
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,938
Yeah, yeah.

495
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:30,779
- Do you really think Billy did it?

496
00:37:30,863 --> 00:37:32,781
He was there, Tatum.

497
00:37:32,865 --> 00:37:37,369
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

498
00:37:37,453 --> 00:37:39,872
- Telephone, honey.

499
00:37:39,955 --> 00:37:41,874
- Who is it?
- It's for Sid.

500
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:43,709
My dad?

501
00:37:43,792 --> 00:37:46,629
- I don't think so.
- Take a message.

502
00:37:46,712 --> 00:37:48,631
No, um, I'll get it.

503
00:37:52,593 --> 00:37:54,970
How's she doin'?

504
00:37:57,056 --> 00:37:59,016
Hello.

505
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,393
Hello, Sidney.

506
00:38:01,477 --> 00:38:03,604
No!

507
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:05,606
Poor Billy-boyfriend.

508
00:38:05,648 --> 00:38:08,484
An innocent guy
doesn't stand a chance with you.

509
00:38:08,567 --> 00:38:12,780
- Leave me alone!
- Looks like you fingered
the wrong guy... again.

510
00:38:12,863 --> 00:38:15,366
- Who are you?
- Dewey!
- Hang up, Sid.

511
00:38:15,449 --> 00:38:18,577
Don't worry.
You'll find out soon enough.

512
00:38:18,661 --> 00:38:21,539
- I promise.

513
00:38:21,622 --> 00:38:23,541
What?

514
00:38:26,627 --> 00:38:28,546
- What?
- What?

515
00:38:34,176 --> 00:38:36,136
Hello?

516
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:50,442
Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night...

517
00:38:50,526 --> 00:38:52,444
is the daughter
of Maureen Prescott...

518
00:38:52,528 --> 00:38:54,905
who was brutally
killed last year...

519
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:57,324
when convicted murderer
Cotton Weary broke into their home...

520
00:38:57,366 --> 00:38:59,952
and savagely raped
and tortured the deceased.

521
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:03,163
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting
appeal for the death sentence...

522
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:06,417
handed down after the young Sidney
testified against him.

523
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,253
She was the key witness in
the state's case against the...

524
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:14,133
It's never gonna stop, is it?

525
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:16,927
Billy was released.

526
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:21,557
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

527
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,185
We're checkin' every cellular account
in the county.

528
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:28,647
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

529
00:39:28,731 --> 00:39:31,317
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

530
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,903
Okay?

531
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:53,422
Don't worry, Sid, it's school.
You'll be safe here.

532
00:39:53,506 --> 00:39:55,925
So how does it feel
to be almost brutally butchered?

533
00:39:56,008 --> 00:39:59,303
- Hey, leave her alone!
- People wanna know.
They have a right to know.

534
00:39:59,386 --> 00:40:01,305
- Leave her alone.
- How does it feel?

535
00:40:01,388 --> 00:40:04,934
She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

536
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:07,436
What?

537
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,606
Just a sec.

538
00:40:20,115 --> 00:40:22,451
Stop right there.

539
00:40:22,535 --> 00:40:24,828
I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.

540
00:40:24,912 --> 00:40:27,456
- Kenny, camera, now!
- Off the record. No camera.

541
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,668
- Forget it.
- Please? You owe me.

542
00:40:30,751 --> 00:40:33,212
- I owe you shit!
- You owe my mother!

543
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,967
Your mother's murder
was last year's hottest court case.

544
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,094
Somebody was gonna write about it.

545
00:40:40,135 --> 00:40:43,097
And it had to be you with all your lies
and bullshit theories.

546
00:40:43,138 --> 00:40:45,933
What is your problem?
You got what you wanted.

547
00:40:46,016 --> 00:40:50,271
Cotton Weary's in jail.
They're gonna gas him.
A book is not gonna change that.

548
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,526
Do you still think
he's innocent?

549
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:58,404
Your testimony put him away.
It doesn't really matter what I think.

550
00:40:58,487 --> 00:41:02,449
During the trial, you did
all those stories about me.
You called me a liar.

551
00:41:02,491 --> 00:41:04,702
I think you
falsely identified him, yes.

552
00:41:04,785 --> 00:41:08,289
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.

553
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,332
And has his story changed?

554
00:41:10,374 --> 00:41:12,334
Not one word.

555
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:14,962
He admits to having sex
with your mother, but that's all.

556
00:41:15,004 --> 00:41:17,298
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.

557
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:19,758
He raped her,
and then he...

558
00:41:19,842 --> 00:41:22,720
He butchered her.
Her blood was all over his coat.

559
00:41:22,803 --> 00:41:24,722
He was drunk that night.

560
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:27,516
He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.

561
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,770
- I saw him leave wearing it.
- No, you saw someone leave
wearing that coat.

562
00:41:31,854 --> 00:41:37,443
The same someone who planted it
in Cotton's car, framing him.

563
00:41:37,526 --> 00:41:41,655
No. Cotton murdered my mother.

564
00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:46,410
You're not so sure anymore,
are you?

565
00:41:47,953 --> 00:41:51,790
Nice welt, sweetie.
Let's go, Sid.

566
00:41:51,874 --> 00:41:53,792
The killer's still
on the loose, isn't he?

567
00:41:53,876 --> 00:41:56,253
- Come on, Sid.
- Those murders are related.

568
00:41:56,337 --> 00:41:59,131
I'm sorry I mangled your face.

569
00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:02,301
- Sidney, don't go!
- Just stop, all right?

570
00:42:07,848 --> 00:42:09,767
Jesus Christ!

571
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:13,020
An innocent man on death row.
A killer still on the loose.

572
00:42:13,062 --> 00:42:15,856
- Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
- You wanna go live?

573
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:19,193
- Not so fast. We don't have
anything concrete.
- You can't just sit on it.

574
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:22,363
I know!
That's why we need proof.

575
00:42:22,404 --> 00:42:26,492
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.

576
00:42:26,575 --> 00:42:29,912
Do you know what that
could do for my book sales?

577
00:42:29,995 --> 00:42:32,456
This is a mistake.
I shouldn't be here.

578
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,836
I want you to meet me right here
after class, okay, Sid?

579
00:42:36,919 --> 00:42:39,213
All right.

580
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:43,926
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?

581
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:46,136
Oh, you mean after you
branded him the Candyman?

582
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,180
- No, his heart's broken. Ow!
- Stu!

583
00:42:57,356 --> 00:42:59,275
Why are they doing this?

584
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:02,653
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.

585
00:43:02,736 --> 00:43:05,781
- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.

586
00:43:05,865 --> 00:43:08,617
Sidney!

587
00:43:08,701 --> 00:43:10,744
- Ow!
- Jesus, shit!

588
00:43:10,828 --> 00:43:13,581
It's just me.

589
00:43:13,664 --> 00:43:17,168
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.

590
00:43:17,251 --> 00:43:19,670
No. No, I-I don't.

591
00:43:19,753 --> 00:43:23,174
It's just...
somebody was there.

592
00:43:23,257 --> 00:43:25,259
Billy, someone tried to kill me.

593
00:43:25,301 --> 00:43:29,263
I know, I know. The cops said
I scared him away. It wasn't me, Sid.

594
00:43:29,305 --> 00:43:33,726
I know. He called me again
last night at Tatum's house.

595
00:43:33,809 --> 00:43:36,604
You see? It couldn't have
been me. I was in jail.

596
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:38,606
Remember?

597
00:43:39,982 --> 00:43:43,444
I'm so... sorry.
Please understand.

598
00:43:43,485 --> 00:43:45,446
Understand what?

599
00:43:45,487 --> 00:43:48,032
That I have a girlfriend
who would rather accuse me...

600
00:43:48,115 --> 00:43:50,826
of being a psychopathic killer
than touch me?

601
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:54,038
You know that's not true.

602
00:43:54,121 --> 00:43:56,874
- Then what is it?
- What... is it?

603
00:43:56,957 --> 00:43:59,752
Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night!

604
00:43:59,835 --> 00:44:01,754
I mean between us.

605
00:44:01,837 --> 00:44:04,632
You haven't been
the same since...

606
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,886
- Since your mother died.
- Is your brain leaking?

607
00:44:08,969 --> 00:44:11,472
My mom was killed.
I can't believe you're bringing this up!

608
00:44:11,514 --> 00:44:15,768
- It's been a year.
- Tomorrow! One year tomorrow.

609
00:44:15,851 --> 00:44:17,770
I think it's time
you got over that.

610
00:44:17,853 --> 00:44:21,148
When my mom left my dad,
I accepted it. That's the way it is.

611
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:23,108
She's not coming back.

612
00:44:23,192 --> 00:44:26,278
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.

613
00:44:26,362 --> 00:44:29,323
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

614
00:44:29,365 --> 00:44:32,409
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
It's a bad analogy.

615
00:44:32,493 --> 00:44:34,745
It's just that...

616
00:44:34,828 --> 00:44:37,831
I want my girlfriend back.

617
00:44:40,125 --> 00:44:42,044
Sid!

618
00:44:42,127 --> 00:44:44,046
Billy, I am sorry
if my traumatized life...

619
00:44:44,129 --> 00:44:47,049
is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.

620
00:44:47,132 --> 00:44:50,302
What? Wh...
Nobody said that. Sid!

621
00:44:52,054 --> 00:44:53,973
Stupid.

622
00:44:54,056 --> 00:44:56,183
You make me so sick!

623
00:44:56,267 --> 00:45:00,729
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me!

624
00:45:00,813 --> 00:45:05,234
So, two of
your fellow students...

625
00:45:05,317 --> 00:45:07,528
just savagely murdered...

626
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:10,823
and this is the way you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

627
00:45:10,906 --> 00:45:14,243
Let me tell you something.
You're both expelled! Get out!

628
00:45:14,326 --> 00:45:17,580
Come on, Mr. Himbry!
It was just a joke.

629
00:45:17,663 --> 00:45:19,582
That's not fair!

630
00:45:22,751 --> 00:45:25,421
You're absolutely right.
It is not fair.

631
00:45:25,504 --> 00:45:27,840
Fairness would be
to rip your insides out...

632
00:45:27,923 --> 00:45:30,050
hang you from a tree
so we can expose you...

633
00:45:30,092 --> 00:45:33,095
for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.

634
00:45:45,191 --> 00:45:48,110
She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.

635
00:45:48,194 --> 00:45:50,446
- Why would she lie about it?
- For attention!

636
00:45:50,529 --> 00:45:52,781
The girl has some serious issues.

637
00:45:58,913 --> 00:46:00,831
What if she did it?

638
00:46:00,915 --> 00:46:03,375
What if Sidney killed
Casey and Steve?

639
00:46:03,459 --> 00:46:05,377
Why would she do that?

640
00:46:05,461 --> 00:46:08,756
Maybe she had the hots for Steve
and killed them both in a jealous rage.

641
00:46:08,797 --> 00:46:13,761
What would Sidney want with Steve?
She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend.

642
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:17,223
Maybe she's a slut
just like her mother.

643
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:20,601
- You're evil.
- Please, it's a common fact.

644
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:24,605
- Her mother was a tramp.
- Cut some slack. She watched
her mom get butchered.

645
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:26,899
And it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.

646
00:46:26,982 --> 00:46:29,568
Her mother's death leaves her
disturbed and hostile.

647
00:46:29,652 --> 00:46:33,197
In a cruel and inhumane world,
she's delusional.

648
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,242
Where is God? Etcetera.
Completely suicidal.

649
00:46:36,325 --> 00:46:39,078
One day she snaps.
She wants to kill herself...

650
00:46:39,161 --> 00:46:42,581
but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year...

651
00:46:42,665 --> 00:46:46,585
and homicide is a much healthier,
therapeutic expression.

652
00:46:46,669 --> 00:46:49,588
- Where do you get this shit?
- Ricki Lake.

653
00:46:49,672 --> 00:46:52,800
You are pathetic.

654
00:47:05,688 --> 00:47:08,190
Pathetic.

655
00:47:35,217 --> 00:47:37,428
Sidney.

656
00:47:42,057 --> 00:47:43,976
Is someone there?

657
00:48:23,641 --> 00:48:25,601
In what appears to be a prank...

658
00:48:25,643 --> 00:48:28,312
several students were seen
wearing scary masks.

659
00:48:28,395 --> 00:48:30,314
School officials
have yet to comment...

660
00:48:30,397 --> 00:48:34,276
but this is known to be
the same costume worn by the killer.

661
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:38,447
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker
and her boyfriend Steven Orth
have already lost their lives.

662
00:48:38,531 --> 00:48:40,449
Who's next?

663
00:48:40,533 --> 00:48:44,370
You can literally feel
the fear on this campus.

664
00:48:44,453 --> 00:48:47,498
Hi! Gale Weathers,
field correspondent, "Top Story."

665
00:48:47,581 --> 00:48:49,500
I know who you are,
Miss Weathers.

666
00:48:49,583 --> 00:48:53,963
- How's the eye?
- It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?

667
00:48:54,046 --> 00:48:55,965
No, everything's under control.

668
00:48:56,048 --> 00:48:59,677
- Of course. You're here.
- You're not supposed to be here.

669
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,763
I know. I should be in New York
covering the Sharon Stone stalker...

670
00:49:02,847 --> 00:49:04,807
but who knew?

671
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:07,351
You look awfully young
to be a police officer.

672
00:49:07,434 --> 00:49:10,020
I'm 25 years old.

673
00:49:10,104 --> 00:49:12,022
You know, in a demographic study...

674
00:49:12,106 --> 00:49:15,484
I proved to be most popular
amongst males 11 to 24.

675
00:49:15,568 --> 00:49:20,030
Guess I just missed you.
Of course, you don't look a day over 12.

676
00:49:20,114 --> 00:49:22,449
Except in that
upper torso area.

677
00:49:22,491 --> 00:49:25,828
- Does the force require you to work out?
- No, ma'am.

678
00:49:25,911 --> 00:49:27,830
'Cause of my boyish good looks...

679
00:49:27,913 --> 00:49:31,709
muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.

680
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:34,420
I need your attention now, kids.

681
00:49:34,503 --> 00:49:36,547
Due to the recent events
that have occurred...

682
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:40,634
effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further notice.

683
00:49:40,676 --> 00:49:45,264
- The Woodsboro police department
has issued a citywide curfew...

684
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:49,101
beginning at 9:00 tonight.

685
00:49:49,185 --> 00:49:51,103
Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

686
00:49:51,187 --> 00:49:53,147
Serial killer's
not really accurate.

687
00:49:53,189 --> 00:49:56,025
Gotta knock off
a couple more to get that title.

688
00:49:56,108 --> 00:49:59,153
Well, we can hope, can't we?

689
00:49:59,195 --> 00:50:02,323
I mean, we certainly
don't have any leads.

690
00:50:02,364 --> 00:50:05,492
- Have you located Sidney's father yet?
- No, not yet.

691
00:50:05,534 --> 00:50:10,873
- He's not a suspect, is he?
- We haven't ruled him out
as a... possibility.

692
00:50:10,956 --> 00:50:14,460
- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

693
00:50:14,543 --> 00:50:18,297
If I may say so,
Miss Weathers...

694
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:21,884
you are much prettier in person.

695
00:50:21,967 --> 00:50:24,136
So you do watch the show.

696
00:50:25,763 --> 00:50:30,893
I'm 25.
I was 24 for a whole year.

697
00:50:30,976 --> 00:50:34,271
Please, call me Gale!

698
00:50:34,355 --> 00:50:36,690
It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.

699
00:50:36,732 --> 00:50:38,984
No, it was him, Tatum.
I know it.

700
00:50:39,068 --> 00:50:42,988
You're not to pee alone anymore.
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?

701
00:50:43,072 --> 00:50:45,658
"Kizzo-kaskizzo is is-out."

702
00:50:45,741 --> 00:50:47,660
I don't know what you did, Sidney.

703
00:50:47,743 --> 00:50:49,828
But on behalf of the entire
student body, we all say, "Thank you!"

704
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:52,331
- Drop it, Stu.
- I say...

705
00:50:52,414 --> 00:50:55,167
an impromptu party tonight,
my house.

706
00:50:55,251 --> 00:50:57,169
Celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?

707
00:50:57,253 --> 00:50:59,171
Are you serious?

708
00:50:59,255 --> 00:51:01,173
This little vixen...

709
00:51:01,257 --> 00:51:03,551
doesn't invite the entire world,
we'll be fine.

710
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:06,053
Intimate gathering,
intimate friends.

711
00:51:06,095 --> 00:51:08,055
What do you say, Sid?

712
00:51:08,097 --> 00:51:10,057
I mean, pathos could
have its perks.

713
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:12,560
Totally protected.
Yo, I am so buff.

714
00:51:12,601 --> 00:51:14,687
I got you covered, girl.

715
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:18,691
Come on, Sid. For me?
It could be fun.

716
00:51:19,692 --> 00:51:21,986
Okay. Whatever.

717
00:51:22,069 --> 00:51:23,988
Yeah? Nice.

718
00:51:24,071 --> 00:51:25,990
Cool. You guys
bring food, all right?

719
00:51:43,966 --> 00:51:45,926
Yes?

720
00:51:45,968 --> 00:51:47,928
Hello?

721
00:52:22,421 --> 00:52:25,633
- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me? Huh?

722
00:52:25,716 --> 00:52:28,469
- Not you, Fred.
- You prick.

723
00:53:19,061 --> 00:53:22,481
Aaaah! Aaah!

724
00:53:22,565 --> 00:53:24,692
Ohhhhh!

725
00:53:34,577 --> 00:53:38,747
School's out for summer

726
00:53:41,333 --> 00:53:44,253
- School's out
- What if Cotton Weary
is telling the truth?

727
00:53:44,336 --> 00:53:47,548
Maybe he was having
an affair with your mom.

728
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:51,677
I mean, your dad was always out of town
on business. Maybe...

729
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:54,847
Maybe your mom was just
a very unhappy woman.

730
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:58,893
If they were having an affair, how come
Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

731
00:53:58,976 --> 00:54:03,772
Well, you can't prove a rumor.
That's why it's a rumor.

732
00:54:03,856 --> 00:54:07,902
Right. Created by that
little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.

733
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:11,864
It goes further back, Sid.

734
00:54:11,947 --> 00:54:14,867
There's been talk
about other men.

735
00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:17,411
And you believe it.

736
00:54:17,494 --> 00:54:23,292
Well, you can only hear
that Richard Gere gerbil story
so many times...

737
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:26,295
before you have to start
believing it.

738
00:54:30,132 --> 00:54:32,259
Oh, I'm sorry.

739
00:54:34,803 --> 00:54:37,765
Y-You know, if I was wrong
about Cotton Weary...

740
00:54:37,806 --> 00:54:39,767
then... the killer's
still out there.

741
00:54:39,808 --> 00:54:41,769
Don't go there, Sid.

742
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:44,939
You're starting to sound like some
Wes Carpenter flick or something.

743
00:54:45,022 --> 00:54:48,984
Don't freak yourself, okay? We've got
a long night ahead of us. Okay?

744
00:54:50,027 --> 00:54:51,987
Let's boogie.

745
00:54:55,658 --> 00:54:57,576
It's alive!

746
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,580
- Henry...
- Oh, in the name of God,
now I know...

747
00:55:01,664 --> 00:55:03,582
Excuse me, dude.

748
00:55:05,334 --> 00:55:07,294
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.

749
00:55:09,672 --> 00:55:11,632
Ohhhh!

750
00:55:11,674 --> 00:55:14,051
Dork.

751
00:55:14,134 --> 00:55:17,054
Jesus, this place
is packed tonight, man.

752
00:55:17,137 --> 00:55:20,558
- We had a run
in the mass murder section.
- Comin' to my fiesta?

753
00:55:20,641 --> 00:55:23,143
Yeah, I'm off early.
Curfew, you know.

754
00:55:23,227 --> 00:55:26,188
What's that werewolf movie
with E.T.'s mom in it?

755
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:29,316
- "The Howling."
Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

756
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:34,488
- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?

757
00:55:34,572 --> 00:55:38,534
If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath...

758
00:55:38,576 --> 00:55:41,537
would you be standing
in the horror section?

759
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:45,499
What? It was just a misunderstanding.
He didn't do anything.

760
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,501
You're such a little lapdog.

761
00:55:47,543 --> 00:55:51,005
- He's got "killer" printed
all over his forehead.
- Ohhh-kay!

762
00:55:51,088 --> 00:55:54,800
Really? Well, why'd the cops
let him go, smart guy?

763
00:55:54,884 --> 00:55:58,971
Obviously they don't
watch enough movies. This is
standard horror movie stuff.

764
00:55:59,054 --> 00:56:03,684
- "Prom Night" revisited, man.
- Yeah? Why would he wanna
kill his own girlfriend?

765
00:56:03,726 --> 00:56:06,812
There's always some stupid,
bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.

766
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:10,441
- Oh?
- That's the beauty of it all:
Simplicity.

767
00:56:10,524 --> 00:56:14,195
Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you lose your target audience.

768
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:16,322
Well, what's his reason?

769
00:56:16,405 --> 00:56:18,866
Maybe Sidney
wouldn't have sex with him.

770
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:22,411
- What, is she
savin' herself for you?
- Maybe.

771
00:56:22,494 --> 00:56:27,166
Now that Billy tried to mutilate her,
do you think Sid would go out with me?

772
00:56:32,671 --> 00:56:35,049
No, I don't at all. No.

773
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:38,469
You know who I think it is?

774
00:56:38,552 --> 00:56:41,180
You know, I think it's her father.

775
00:56:41,263 --> 00:56:43,682
Why can't they find her pops, man?

776
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:45,851
Because he's probably dead.

777
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:49,480
His body will come poppin' up
in the last reel somewhere!

778
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:53,442
Eyes gouged out, fingers cut off,
teeth knocked out!

779
00:56:53,526 --> 00:56:56,237
- The police are always
off track with this shit.
- Man!

780
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,781
If they'd watch "Prom Night,"
they'd save time.

781
00:56:58,822 --> 00:57:02,785
There's a formula to it.
A very simple formula!
Everybody's a suspect!

782
00:57:07,122 --> 00:57:11,544
I'm telling you, the dad's
a red herring. It's Billy.

783
00:57:13,128 --> 00:57:16,048
How do we know
you're not the killer? Huh?

784
00:57:16,131 --> 00:57:18,634
- Huh?
- Hi, Billy.

785
00:57:18,717 --> 00:57:22,096
Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its
reality button. You ever think of that?

786
00:57:22,137 --> 00:57:25,099
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.

787
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,602
- If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.
- That's right.

788
00:57:28,644 --> 00:57:30,604
And what would be your motive?

789
00:57:30,646 --> 00:57:32,815
It's the millennium.

790
00:57:32,898 --> 00:57:34,817
Motives are incidental.

791
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,902
"Millennium." Hmm.

792
00:57:36,986 --> 00:57:41,282
"Millennium." I like that.
That's good. It's the millennium.

793
00:57:42,366 --> 00:57:44,326
Good kid.

794
00:57:45,452 --> 00:57:48,581
"Millennium."
Good word, my man.

795
00:57:48,664 --> 00:57:50,624
Are you telling me
that's not a killer?

796
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,130
You'll see him
in your nightmares

797
00:57:56,172 --> 00:57:58,966
You'll see him
in your dreams

798
00:58:02,011 --> 00:58:04,763
He'll appear
out of nowhere

799
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:07,099
But he ain't

800
00:58:07,183 --> 00:58:09,810
What he seems

801
00:58:09,894 --> 00:58:12,563
You'll see him
in your head

802
00:58:12,646 --> 00:58:14,607
On the TV screen

803
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:18,319
Hey, buddy, I'm warnin' you
to turn it off

804
00:58:18,402 --> 00:58:20,779
Ah, he's a ghost
He's a god

805
00:58:20,863 --> 00:58:23,991
He's a man
He's a guru

806
00:58:25,534 --> 00:58:30,331
You're one microscopic cog
in his catastrophic plan

807
00:58:30,372 --> 00:58:34,293
Designed and directed
by his red right hand

808
00:58:35,377 --> 00:58:37,296
Sure is quiet.

809
00:58:37,379 --> 00:58:39,298
God, look at this place.

810
00:58:39,381 --> 00:58:41,717
It's "The Town
That Dreaded Sundown."

811
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,221
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

812
00:58:45,304 --> 00:58:47,223
- Mmm.
- Hey, Sid, just think.

813
00:58:47,306 --> 00:58:50,226
If they make a movie about you,
who's gonna play you?

814
00:58:50,309 --> 00:58:53,896
- I shudder to think.
- I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

815
00:58:53,979 --> 00:58:57,399
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori Spelling.

816
00:58:57,483 --> 00:59:00,402
I'm just gonna be
a few minutes.

817
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:02,404
You girls don't go too far.

818
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:06,867
Is Billy gonna be there tonight?

819
00:59:06,909 --> 00:59:09,995
He'd better not be.
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.

820
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,998
I think we can live without
the endorphin rush for one night.

821
00:59:14,667 --> 00:59:18,087
Billy's right, you know. Whenever he
touches me, I just can't relax.

822
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:21,757
So you have a few
intimacy issues as a result of
your mother's untimely death.

823
00:59:21,841 --> 00:59:24,343
That's no big deal.
You'll thaw out.

824
00:59:24,426 --> 00:59:27,847
Yeah, but he has been so patient
with me with all the sex stuff.

825
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:31,559
How many guys would put up with
a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

826
00:59:31,642 --> 00:59:34,603
Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?

827
00:59:43,028 --> 00:59:44,947
Dewey, where the hell you been?

828
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:47,950
I was keepin' an eye
on Sidney, uh...

829
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:53,914
- Thought you quit.
- I did. But damn it...

830
00:59:53,956 --> 00:59:57,251
Dewey, Vital Phone
just faxed us.

831
00:59:57,334 --> 01:00:01,755
Those calls are listed
to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.

832
01:00:01,797 --> 01:00:05,426
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.

833
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:09,638
There's no way a cellular
coulda been cloned?

834
01:00:09,722 --> 01:00:12,474
There's more.
Guess what tomorrow is.

835
01:00:12,558 --> 01:00:15,102
The anniversary
of his wife's death.

836
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,941
We'll keep the roadblocks and
the curfew in effect through the night.

837
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:24,278
If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.

838
01:00:25,446 --> 01:00:27,364
- Where's Sidney?
- She's with my sister.

839
01:00:27,448 --> 01:00:30,951
- You want me to bring her in?
- Naw.

840
01:00:31,035 --> 01:00:32,995
Not just yet.

841
01:00:33,037 --> 01:00:36,498
Let's find Neil first,
make sure he's our man.

842
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:46,425
You stay close to Sidney.

843
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:49,094
Don't let her
out of your sight.

844
01:00:49,178 --> 01:00:51,430
Yes, sir.

845
01:01:10,991 --> 01:01:14,620
Say a prayer
for the youth of America

846
01:01:17,581 --> 01:01:20,709
God bless the youth
of America

847
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:26,048
I can't stand
their sight anymore

848
01:01:26,131 --> 01:01:28,342
- All right, you girls have fun.

849
01:01:28,425 --> 01:01:31,387
Not too much fun,
or I'll bust ya.

850
01:01:32,638 --> 01:01:34,557
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.

851
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:42,982
You're obsessed

852
01:01:43,065 --> 01:01:47,278
You're obsessed

853
01:01:47,361 --> 01:01:49,280
- Here, kids!

854
01:01:51,699 --> 01:01:53,617
Oh! That's absurd.

855
01:01:53,701 --> 01:01:56,620
You guys were tardy for the party,
so we started without you.

856
01:01:56,704 --> 01:01:58,664
- My man!

857
01:02:13,387 --> 01:02:15,306
Shh.

858
01:02:16,515 --> 01:02:18,434
Were we spotted?

859
01:02:18,517 --> 01:02:21,437
I don't think so.
Go get the camera.

860
01:02:23,981 --> 01:02:26,317
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare ya.

861
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,570
- Deputy, that's okay.
- What brings you to these parts?

862
01:02:29,653 --> 01:02:33,782
Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.

863
01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:37,912
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.

864
01:02:37,995 --> 01:02:40,748
Then what are you doing here?

865
01:02:43,334 --> 01:02:45,794
Just keepin' an eye on things.

866
01:02:45,836 --> 01:02:48,797
I'm gonna check the party out.

867
01:02:48,839 --> 01:02:52,301
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.

868
01:02:53,344 --> 01:02:56,639
Let me just get my coat. Thanks.

869
01:03:01,852 --> 01:03:04,813
- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

870
01:03:04,897 --> 01:03:06,815
Oh! Yeah.

871
01:03:08,984 --> 01:03:11,946
- How many "Evil Deads"?
- One! Two!

872
01:03:11,987 --> 01:03:14,281
- How many "Hellraisers"?
- Hellraiser right here.

873
01:03:14,365 --> 01:03:17,826
"The Fog," "Terror Train,"
"Prom Night."

874
01:03:17,868 --> 01:03:21,330
How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?

875
01:03:21,372 --> 01:03:23,916
She's the... scream queen.

876
01:03:23,999 --> 01:03:27,169
- With a set of lungs
like that, she should be.
- Yeah.

877
01:03:27,253 --> 01:03:28,796
Tits. See?

878
01:03:28,879 --> 01:03:30,840
- Oh, I'll get it.

879
01:03:32,383 --> 01:03:34,844
Hey, Tate, grab another beer,
would ya?

880
01:03:34,885 --> 01:03:37,304
- There's more
beer in the garage.

881
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:39,306
What am I, the beer wench?

882
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,309
- She was nominated for "Terror Train."
- Oh, yeah?

883
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:45,312
You are not gonna believe who's here!
It's that chick from "Top Story"!

884
01:03:45,354 --> 01:03:47,273
- Gale Weathers?
- Here. Yeah.

885
01:03:50,192 --> 01:03:52,152
You're under age, son.

886
01:03:52,194 --> 01:03:54,154
I'm kiddin'.
Have a good time.

887
01:03:54,196 --> 01:03:55,990
- Dewey.
- Hi.

888
01:03:56,073 --> 01:03:59,159
Dewey.

889
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:02,329
- What is she doing here?
- She's with me!

890
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,790
- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.

891
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:09,211
Now leave, and take
your media mouth with you.

892
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:13,507
- I just think you're awesome.
- Oh, thank you very much.

893
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:15,509
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.

894
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:17,970
- Hey.
- Hey.

895
01:04:18,053 --> 01:04:20,639
- I need a camera.

896
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:23,976
- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.

897
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:28,189
- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.

898
01:04:30,274 --> 01:04:33,777
- Get out, you're walkin'
- That's the one
I want..."Halloween."

899
01:04:33,861 --> 01:04:37,323
- Too bad, I've spoken

900
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:39,992
When I look at you
you're forgiven

901
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:56,383
Mmm.

902
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,427
You're forgiven

903
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:19,949
- Jesus!

904
01:05:22,326 --> 01:05:24,912
Tatum, it's okay.

905
01:05:34,713 --> 01:05:36,632
Shit.

906
01:05:41,136 --> 01:05:43,097
Hey, shitheads!

907
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:46,600
Hello!

908
01:05:47,935 --> 01:05:50,896
Shit. Piss.

909
01:06:08,163 --> 01:06:09,790
Is that you, Randy?

910
01:06:12,376 --> 01:06:15,838
Cute. What movie is this from?
"I Spit On Your Garage"?

911
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:21,135
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

912
01:06:21,218 --> 01:06:24,180
Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?

913
01:06:24,221 --> 01:06:26,932
Can I be the helpless victim?

914
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:30,436
Okay, let's see... No, please
don't kill me, Mr. Ghost Face.

915
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:33,022
I wanna be in the sequel!

916
01:06:34,398 --> 01:06:37,651
Cut, Casper.
That's a wrap.

917
01:06:39,528 --> 01:06:42,865
Randy, what the hell
are you doing? Aaah!

918
01:06:45,117 --> 01:06:47,203
Aaah! Stop!

919
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:56,003
Aaaah!

920
01:07:02,218 --> 01:07:04,845
Fucker!

921
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:07,014
Aaah!

922
01:07:25,115 --> 01:07:34,500
- Aaah! Aaaah!

923
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:37,878
Aaaaah!

924
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,340
No! No!

925
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,985
- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.

926
01:08:01,068 --> 01:08:03,988
- Tatum, come on!
- There's nobody here
but us chickens!

927
01:08:04,071 --> 01:08:07,032
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.

928
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:08,951
- Aaah!

929
01:08:09,034 --> 01:08:11,579
Oh. Billy. Hey.

930
01:08:11,662 --> 01:08:13,622
Billy. Hmm.
What are you doin' here?

931
01:08:13,664 --> 01:08:16,458
I was hoping I could talk
to Sid alone.

932
01:08:16,542 --> 01:08:19,712
You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.

933
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:22,715
Why don't you go up
to my parents' room?

934
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:26,218
You know, you guys
can talk, whatever.

935
01:08:26,302 --> 01:08:28,721
Subtlety, Stu.
You should look it up.

936
01:08:29,847 --> 01:08:32,808
No, i-it's okay.
We do need to talk.

937
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:37,104
Oooh! Oww.

938
01:08:42,318 --> 01:08:44,236
What's Leatherface doin' here?

939
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,906
Cute. He came to make up.

940
01:08:46,989 --> 01:08:49,909
There goes my chance with Sid.
Damn it.

941
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:52,077
As if. That's all I'm sayin'.

942
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,079
As if.

943
01:08:54,163 --> 01:08:56,081
Oh, really, Alicia?

944
01:08:57,166 --> 01:09:00,002
"As if."
I'm gonna go check on them.

945
01:09:00,085 --> 01:09:03,088
- Come on!
- It was nice
to meet all of you.

946
01:09:06,383 --> 01:09:08,636
You're a genius.

947
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:10,971
- Oh, shit.
- What?

948
01:09:11,055 --> 01:09:13,516
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?

949
01:09:13,557 --> 01:09:17,520
I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

950
01:09:17,561 --> 01:09:21,023
Lt'll be fine. Just record it.
Oh, the placement is perfect.

951
01:09:21,065 --> 01:09:22,525
- Tell me, Kenneth...
- Hmm?

952
01:09:22,566 --> 01:09:26,028
Has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the Pulitzer?

953
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:28,280
Well, first time
for everything.

954
01:09:28,364 --> 01:09:30,282
You're damn right.

955
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,791
S-So, um...

956
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:42,795
- So...

957
01:09:45,756 --> 01:09:47,716
I'm sorry.

958
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:52,805
I've been selfish,
and I want to apologize.

959
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:56,016
No, Billy, I-I'm...

960
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:59,687
the one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed...

961
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:02,523
with all this
post-traumatic stress.

962
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:07,862
- You lost your mom.
- Yeah, I know, but you're right.

963
01:10:07,945 --> 01:10:09,905
Enough is enough.

964
01:10:09,947 --> 01:10:12,908
I can't wallow in
the grief process forever...

965
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:14,910
and...

966
01:10:16,453 --> 01:10:18,414
and I can't...

967
01:10:18,455 --> 01:10:22,710
keep lying to myself
about who my mom was.

968
01:10:26,505 --> 01:10:28,257
Yeah, I think
I'm really...

969
01:10:30,843 --> 01:10:33,095
scared...

970
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:36,599
that I'm gonna turn out
just like her, you know?

971
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:41,228
Like "The Bad Seed"
or somethin'.

972
01:10:41,312 --> 01:10:44,273
And I know it doesn't make sense.

973
01:10:45,441 --> 01:10:47,359
Yeah, it does.

974
01:10:49,278 --> 01:10:51,238
Hmm.

975
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,742
It's like Jodie Foster in
"The Silence of the Lambs"...

976
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:58,746
when she keeps having
flashbacks of her dead father.

977
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:00,915
But this is life.

978
01:11:00,956 --> 01:11:02,917
This isn't a movie.

979
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:05,503
Sure it is, Sid.

980
01:11:05,586 --> 01:11:07,505
It's all...
It's all a movie.

981
01:11:07,588 --> 01:11:09,507
It's all...

982
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:11,509
one great big movie.

983
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:20,476
Only you can't pick your genre.

984
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:49,463
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?

985
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:55,511
Or even a good porno.

986
01:11:58,055 --> 01:12:00,015
What?

987
01:12:00,057 --> 01:12:02,017
You heard me.

988
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:11,944
Are you sure?

989
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,948
Yeah.

990
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:17,950
I think so.

991
01:12:34,633 --> 01:12:36,844
Look, look, look.
Here it comes.

992
01:12:36,927 --> 01:12:38,888
- Whoa!
- Ohh!

993
01:12:38,929 --> 01:12:42,892
The blood is all wrong!
Why do they do that? It's too red!

994
01:12:42,933 --> 01:12:44,894
Wait. Here comes another.

995
01:12:46,812 --> 01:12:48,731
- Oooh! Oooh!
- Yes! Yes!

996
01:12:48,814 --> 01:12:51,233
Predictable.
I knew he was gonna bite it.

997
01:12:51,317 --> 01:12:54,236
- How can you watch
this shit over and over?
- Shh!

998
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:56,739
I wanna see
Jamie Lee's breasts.

999
01:12:56,822 --> 01:12:59,241
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Breasts?

1000
01:12:59,325 --> 01:13:01,702
Not until "Trading Places" in '83.

1001
01:13:01,744 --> 01:13:04,205
Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.

1002
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:08,375
- She never showed her tits
'til she went legits.
- Could afford a decent pair.

1003
01:13:08,417 --> 01:13:12,838
That's why she always
outsmarted the killer in the
big chase scene at the end.

1004
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:15,841
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?

1005
01:13:15,925 --> 01:13:17,843
- What rules?
- You don't...

1006
01:13:20,012 --> 01:13:22,515
Jesus Christ.
You don't know the rules?

1007
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:24,683
Have an aneurysm,
why don't ya?

1008
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:27,686
There are certain rules
one must abide by...

1009
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:30,606
in order to successfully
survive a horror movie.

1010
01:13:30,689 --> 01:13:33,692
For instance, number one:
You can never have sex.

1011
01:13:35,819 --> 01:13:38,072
Big no-no!
Big no-no!

1012
01:13:38,155 --> 01:13:39,949
I'd be a dead man.

1013
01:13:40,032 --> 01:13:41,951
Sex equals death. Okay?

1014
01:13:42,034 --> 01:13:45,120
Number two:
You can never drink or do drugs.

1015
01:13:48,040 --> 01:13:49,959
No, the sin factor.

1016
01:13:50,042 --> 01:13:52,962
It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.

1017
01:13:53,045 --> 01:13:56,757
And number three: Never, ever, ever
under any circumstances, say...

1018
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:58,759
"I'll be right back,"
'cause you won't be back.

1019
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:01,595
- I'm gettin' another beer.
You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

1020
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:04,098
- I'll be right back!
- Ohhhh!

1021
01:14:06,475 --> 01:14:10,271
You push the laws and you end up dead.
See you in the kitchen with a knife.

1022
01:14:10,354 --> 01:14:13,816
Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.

1023
01:14:13,858 --> 01:14:16,318
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?

1024
01:14:16,402 --> 01:14:18,320
You don't know the rules?

1025
01:14:18,404 --> 01:14:22,616
- There are rules one must abide
by to survive a horror movie.
- Boring.

1026
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:24,618
- For instance...

1027
01:14:25,870 --> 01:14:27,830
The sheriff just radioed.

1028
01:14:27,872 --> 01:14:31,584
Somebody reported a car
in the bushes down the road.
I'm gonna go check it out.

1029
01:14:31,667 --> 01:14:34,587
- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.

1030
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:36,797
If you're sure it's all right.

1031
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:40,676
Uh, ma'am,
I'm the deputy of this town.

1032
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:44,138
Be right back.

1033
01:14:45,639 --> 01:14:47,558
- Kids Shouting, Whooping]

1034
01:14:47,641 --> 01:14:49,810
You push the laws,
you end up dead.

1035
01:14:49,894 --> 01:14:52,855
- W... Excuse me, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm?

1036
01:14:52,897 --> 01:14:54,857
I thought maybe we'd walk.

1037
01:14:56,108 --> 01:14:59,945
It's such a nice night out.
I got a flashlight.

1038
01:15:02,239 --> 01:15:04,533
You're not scared, are ya?

1039
01:15:04,617 --> 01:15:06,535
No.

1040
01:15:06,577 --> 01:15:09,121
- All right.
- Great.

1041
01:15:12,917 --> 01:15:16,378
- Do you know what that constellation is?
- No. What is it?

1042
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:20,716
- I don't know.
That's why I was askin' you.

1043
01:15:23,969 --> 01:15:25,888
What happened to Tatum, Stu?

1044
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:28,849
She probably got pissed
at me and bailed. Bye.

1045
01:15:30,893 --> 01:15:32,853
No, I'm just kidding.

1046
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:52,373
Look! Here comes
the obligatory tit shot!

1047
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:58,003
- Yes! Oh! Beautiful!
- Lovely!

1048
01:15:58,087 --> 01:16:00,005
Ohh! Ohh.

1049
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:02,758
- Oh, my God.
- I'll leave you guys alone.

1050
01:16:03,843 --> 01:16:05,761
You are so...

1051
01:16:07,346 --> 01:16:09,265
amazing.

1052
01:16:15,479 --> 01:16:18,190
- Hello? Yeah?

1053
01:16:22,528 --> 01:16:24,446
Holy shit.

1054
01:16:28,033 --> 01:16:29,910
Listen up.

1055
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:31,787
They found
Principal Himbry dead.

1056
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:35,875
He was gutted and hung from the goalpost
on the football field.

1057
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:40,254
- What are we waiting for?
- Let's go over there
before they bring him down.

1058
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:43,591
- Hey. Hey.
- To arms! To arms!

1059
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:46,594
- Where did he say he was?
- At the football field!

1060
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:49,889
- Come on!
- Where you guys goin'?

1061
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:53,392
We were just gettin'
to the good part.

1062
01:16:53,475 --> 01:16:56,896
Hello? Yeah?

1063
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,242
- Whoo!

1064
01:17:19,168 --> 01:17:22,254
Hi-ho, Silver! Let's go!

1065
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:25,466
So, is... is Dewey
your real name?

1066
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:27,468
No, it's Dwight.

1067
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,470
Dwight?

1068
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:31,805
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

1069
01:17:31,847 --> 01:17:35,643
Dewey's just somethin'
I got stuck with a long time ago.

1070
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:38,145
Well, I like it.

1071
01:17:38,187 --> 01:17:40,147
Sexy.

1072
01:17:40,189 --> 01:17:42,900
- Sexy?
- Mm-hmm.

1073
01:17:42,983 --> 01:17:46,403
Ah, it's just this town's way
of not takin' me serious.

1074
01:17:46,487 --> 01:17:48,906
What about Gale Weathers?

1075
01:17:48,989 --> 01:17:52,076
Sounds like I'm a meteorologist
or something.

1076
01:17:53,327 --> 01:17:55,246
People treat me...

1077
01:17:55,329 --> 01:17:57,706
like I'm the antichrist
of television journalism.

1078
01:17:57,790 --> 01:17:59,708
- I don't think you're that bad.
- No?

1079
01:17:59,792 --> 01:18:01,710
- No? No.

1080
01:18:01,794 --> 01:18:03,712
That's just 'cause
you kinda like me.

1081
01:18:03,796 --> 01:18:06,507
- They sure are comin' fast.
Slow down!

1082
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:10,302
- Freeze... Jump!

1083
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:14,306
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

1084
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,308
Yeah.

1085
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:29,905
I'm sorry.

1086
01:18:29,989 --> 01:18:31,907
I'm on duty.

1087
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:42,251
Is that what you're looking for?

1088
01:18:42,293 --> 01:18:44,253
My whole life.

1089
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,260
- Damn!
- What?

1090
01:18:51,302 --> 01:18:54,263
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.

1091
01:18:54,305 --> 01:18:56,265
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.

1092
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,518
Jesus. What's he doing here?

1093
01:19:00,978 --> 01:19:03,397
We gotta get back.

1094
01:19:06,525 --> 01:19:08,444
You okay?

1095
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:11,989
Yeah.

1096
01:19:12,072 --> 01:19:13,991
Yeah, I'm fine.

1097
01:19:24,668 --> 01:19:26,795
Who'd you call?

1098
01:19:26,879 --> 01:19:28,756
What?

1099
01:19:28,797 --> 01:19:32,760
Um, well, I don't know,
when you're arrested you're
allowed one phone call.

1100
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:35,763
So I was just curious.
Who'd you call?

1101
01:19:37,306 --> 01:19:39,225
Called my dad.

1102
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:44,897
No, um, Sheriff Burke
called your dad. I saw him.

1103
01:19:47,024 --> 01:19:51,111
Yeah, but when I called
I didn't get an answer.

1104
01:19:55,658 --> 01:19:57,618
Huh.

1105
01:20:02,164 --> 01:20:05,292
You don't still think
it was me, do ya?

1106
01:20:08,712 --> 01:20:10,673
No.

1107
01:20:10,756 --> 01:20:12,675
No.

1108
01:20:12,758 --> 01:20:17,847
I was just thinking, if it were
you it'd be a very clever way
to throw me off track.

1109
01:20:17,930 --> 01:20:22,601
You know, using your one phone call to
call me so I wouldn't think it was you.

1110
01:20:22,685 --> 01:20:24,937
Really.

1111
01:20:32,778 --> 01:20:37,324
What do I have to do to prove to you
that I'm not a killer?

1112
01:20:38,826 --> 01:20:41,495
- Oh, my God.
- Huh?

1113
01:20:42,705 --> 01:20:45,040
- Oh, my God.
- Sidney...
- Billy, watch out!

1114
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,501
- Aaah!
- Aaaah!

1115
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,178
Sid.

1116
01:21:06,395 --> 01:21:08,147
No!

1117
01:21:32,505 --> 01:21:35,758
- Shit!

1118
01:21:41,472 --> 01:21:45,184
Help me, somebody! Help me!

1119
01:22:03,827 --> 01:22:06,080
Help me!

1120
01:22:35,526 --> 01:22:39,405
No, Jamie.
Uh, watch out.

1121
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:42,741
Watch out, Jamie.
You know he's around.

1122
01:22:42,825 --> 01:22:45,786
You... You know...

1123
01:22:45,828 --> 01:22:48,330
Look, there he is.
I told you.

1124
01:22:48,414 --> 01:22:51,083
I told you he was
right around the corner.

1125
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:53,127
Jamie. Jamie.

1126
01:22:54,587 --> 01:22:58,299
Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you.

1127
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:00,968
Turn around.
Behind you.

1128
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:04,597
All the time!
Behind you!

1129
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,974
Behind you, Jamie.

1130
01:23:07,016 --> 01:23:11,979
Jamie, turn around.
Ohh! God! Yeah.

1131
01:23:12,021 --> 01:23:14,815
Help me! Help!

1132
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:29,747
- Let me in!

1133
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:33,542
- The killer's coming after me!
He's in the house!
- Where? Wait.

1134
01:23:33,626 --> 01:23:37,129
- There's a camera in the house. Look.
- Behind you!

1135
01:23:37,213 --> 01:23:39,048
- Oh, my God. No.
- Oh, shit.

1136
01:23:39,131 --> 01:23:41,342
Jamie. Jamie.

1137
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:44,053
- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!

1138
01:23:44,136 --> 01:23:46,889
- Behind ya!
- Look around!

1139
01:23:48,766 --> 01:23:51,185
- Shit.
- What?

1140
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:53,729
- We're on 30-second delay.
- Oh, my God.

1141
01:23:55,272 --> 01:23:57,024
Aaaah!

1142
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:03,322
The... door.

1143
01:24:07,243 --> 01:24:10,037
Aaah!

1144
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:50,494
- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.

1145
01:24:50,578 --> 01:24:54,081
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.

1146
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:57,543
Be careful!

1147
01:25:10,681 --> 01:25:14,560
- Neil?

1148
01:25:18,147 --> 01:25:20,065
Mr. Prescott?

1149
01:25:22,193 --> 01:25:24,111
Shit!

1150
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:35,164
Oh!

1151
01:25:40,544 --> 01:25:42,922
Kenny, I need the cellular!

1152
01:25:45,174 --> 01:25:47,092
Kenny!

1153
01:25:48,844 --> 01:25:52,181
- Kenny!
- Kenny! Kenny!

1154
01:26:12,493 --> 01:26:16,121
- 9-1-1.

1155
01:26:16,205 --> 01:26:19,041
- What's going on?
- Ooh! Aah!

1156
01:26:19,124 --> 01:26:21,460
Aaaah!

1157
01:26:31,262 --> 01:26:33,222
Oh, God!

1158
01:26:42,565 --> 01:26:44,984
Oh!

1159
01:26:49,488 --> 01:26:52,825
Oh, God, Kenny, I'm sorry,
but get off my fucking windshield!

1160
01:26:57,913 --> 01:27:00,040
- Stop!

1161
01:27:08,174 --> 01:27:10,092
Oh, God!

1162
01:27:17,308 --> 01:27:20,269
Dewey!

1163
01:27:20,352 --> 01:27:22,271
Dewey!

1164
01:27:22,354 --> 01:27:26,192
- Dewey, where are you?

1165
01:27:26,275 --> 01:27:28,194
Dewey!

1166
01:27:29,278 --> 01:27:30,905
Sidney?

1167
01:27:35,951 --> 01:27:37,953
Dewey!

1168
01:28:05,523 --> 01:28:06,982
Shit!

1169
01:28:33,175 --> 01:28:36,887
7825, suspect at 105 North Avenue 52.

1170
01:28:36,971 --> 01:28:40,140
Hello. Help me, please. I'm at
Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.

1171
01:28:40,224 --> 01:28:44,603
It's 261 Turner Lane.
Please, he's going to try and kill me.

1172
01:29:07,084 --> 01:29:10,337
Sidney! Sidney!

1173
01:29:10,379 --> 01:29:12,840
Jesus, we've got to get
the fuck out of here!

1174
01:29:12,882 --> 01:29:16,260
- Stop right there!
- Don't shoot. It's me!
I found Tatum. She's dead.

1175
01:29:16,343 --> 01:29:18,304
- I think Stu did it.
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!

1176
01:29:18,387 --> 01:29:20,347
- Stay back!
- Stu did it.

1177
01:29:20,389 --> 01:29:22,975
- He killed Billy. He killed my Tatum.
- You did it!

1178
01:29:23,058 --> 01:29:25,352
- He killed my Tatum!
- No, I didn't!
- You lie!

1179
01:29:25,436 --> 01:29:27,688
Sidney, baby, please,
give me that gun!

1180
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:29,690
Give me that gun!
Christ, man!

1181
01:29:29,773 --> 01:29:32,151
No, I didn't.
Sid, he did it!

1182
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:35,738
He did it, Sidney! Please,
I didn't do it. He did it. Please!

1183
01:29:35,821 --> 01:29:38,324
- Please, Sidney. Oh!
- Fuck you both!

1184
01:29:38,407 --> 01:29:41,035
- Please!
- No! No! Sidney!

1185
01:29:41,118 --> 01:29:44,163
- Open up! He did it!

1186
01:29:44,246 --> 01:29:48,542
Help me! He's going crazy!

1187
01:29:48,626 --> 01:29:50,669
- Sidney! Go away!

1188
01:29:50,753 --> 01:29:53,047
Sidney?

1189
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:56,884
Leave me alone.

1190
01:29:59,803 --> 01:30:02,014
- Sid.
- Billy.

1191
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:11,482
Oh! Billy. Billy.
Are you okay?

1192
01:30:11,565 --> 01:30:14,401
- I'm okay.
- I thought you were dead.

1193
01:30:14,443 --> 01:30:17,238
No, I'm like a stuck pig,
but I'm all right.

1194
01:30:17,321 --> 01:30:19,406
Get up.

1195
01:30:19,490 --> 01:30:21,742
- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.

1196
01:30:22,826 --> 01:30:24,745
- Oh, my God.
- We've gotta get help.

1197
01:30:24,828 --> 01:30:27,915
- No, he's out there!
- No, give me the gun.
Give me the gun. It's okay.

1198
01:30:27,998 --> 01:30:30,376
It's okay. It's okay.

1199
01:30:30,459 --> 01:30:32,378
Careful.

1200
01:30:33,546 --> 01:30:36,048
- Please help me!
- Come in, come in!

1201
01:30:36,131 --> 01:30:38,300
Stu's flipped out!
He's gone mad!

1202
01:30:40,761 --> 01:30:42,930
We all go a little mad sometimes.

1203
01:30:42,972 --> 01:30:44,849
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!

1204
01:30:50,855 --> 01:30:54,233
Anthony Perkins, "Psycho."

1205
01:30:57,987 --> 01:31:00,281
Mmm.

1206
01:31:00,322 --> 01:31:04,952
Corn syrup. Same stuff they used
for pig's blood in "Carrie."

1207
01:31:08,163 --> 01:31:10,416
Stu.

1208
01:31:10,499 --> 01:31:14,295
Help me, please.

1209
01:31:14,378 --> 01:31:17,423
Surprise, Sidney.

1210
01:31:20,593 --> 01:31:23,262
- No!
- Ooh!

1211
01:31:23,345 --> 01:31:25,973
Oh, now. Whoa.

1212
01:31:27,683 --> 01:31:31,187
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1213
01:31:31,270 --> 01:31:33,939
Why are you doing this?

1214
01:31:34,023 --> 01:31:36,025
It's all part
of the game, Sidney.

1215
01:31:36,108 --> 01:31:38,861
- It's called "Guess How I'm Gonna Die."
- Fuck you!

1216
01:31:38,944 --> 01:31:43,532
No, no, no, no, no.
We already played that game, remember?

1217
01:31:43,616 --> 01:31:46,660
- You lost.
- It's a fun game, Sidney.

1218
01:31:46,744 --> 01:31:49,747
See, we ask you a question,
and if you get it wrong,

1219
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:51,999
"boo-kah," you die!

1220
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:55,127
You get it right, you die.

1221
01:31:55,211 --> 01:31:58,797
- You're crazy, both of you.
- Actually, we prefer
the term "psychotic."

1222
01:31:58,881 --> 01:32:02,968
- You'll never get away with this.
- Oh, no?

1223
01:32:03,886 --> 01:32:06,055
Tell that to Cotton Weary.

1224
01:32:06,138 --> 01:32:08,849
You wouldn't believe
how easy he was to frame.

1225
01:32:08,933 --> 01:32:12,853
Watch a few movies,
take a few notes.

1226
01:32:12,937 --> 01:32:15,314
- It was fun. - No!

1227
01:32:15,397 --> 01:32:17,650
- Whoa!
- Where're you goin'?

1228
01:32:17,733 --> 01:32:20,402
Why?

1229
01:32:20,486 --> 01:32:22,988
- Why did you kill my mother?

1230
01:32:23,072 --> 01:32:26,825
Why? Why?

1231
01:32:26,909 --> 01:32:29,537
Did you hear that, Stu?
I think she wants a motive.

1232
01:32:31,789 --> 01:32:33,707
I don't really believe
in motive, Sid.

1233
01:32:33,791 --> 01:32:35,709
- I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
- No.

1234
01:32:35,793 --> 01:32:39,922
Did they ever really decide
why Hannibal Lecter liked to
eat people? Don't think so!

1235
01:32:40,005 --> 01:32:43,759
See, it's a lot scarier
when there's no motive, Sid.

1236
01:32:43,843 --> 01:32:46,345
We did your mom a favor, Sid.

1237
01:32:46,428 --> 01:32:50,015
That woman was a slut-bag whore
who flashed her shit all over
town like she was Sharon Stone.

1238
01:32:50,099 --> 01:32:52,518
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney,

1239
01:32:52,601 --> 01:32:55,729
your mother
was no Sharon Stone, hmm?

1240
01:33:00,943 --> 01:33:03,445
Is that motive enough for you?

1241
01:33:04,655 --> 01:33:07,908
How about this?

1242
01:33:07,950 --> 01:33:12,454
Your slut mother
was fucking my father,

1243
01:33:14,290 --> 01:33:17,918
and she's the reason
my mom moved out and abandoned me.

1244
01:33:20,629 --> 01:33:22,631
How's that for a motive?

1245
01:33:22,673 --> 01:33:26,260
Maternal abandonment causes
serious deviant behavior.

1246
01:33:26,343 --> 01:33:29,096
It certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.

1247
01:33:29,138 --> 01:33:33,559
That's right. You gave it up.
Now you're no longer a virgin. Oooh!

1248
01:33:33,642 --> 01:33:35,603
I said "virgin." Whoops!

1249
01:33:35,686 --> 01:33:38,647
Now you gotta die.
Those are the rules.

1250
01:33:38,731 --> 01:33:42,902
Let's pretend it's all
a scary movie, Sid. How do
you think it's gonna end?

1251
01:33:46,197 --> 01:33:49,783
Oh! Oh! This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.

1252
01:33:49,825 --> 01:33:52,328
We got a surprise for you, Sidney.

1253
01:33:52,411 --> 01:33:55,289
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!

1254
01:33:55,331 --> 01:33:58,292
Hold on a sec. I'll be right back.

1255
01:33:58,334 --> 01:34:01,337
You know what time it is, Sid?

1256
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:03,422
It's after midnight.

1257
01:34:03,506 --> 01:34:07,176
It's your mom's anniversary.
Congratulations.

1258
01:34:07,259 --> 01:34:10,137
We killed her exactly
one year ago today.

1259
01:34:10,179 --> 01:34:14,642
Attention! Oh, what do we have
behind door number three, Sidney?

1260
01:34:14,725 --> 01:34:16,477
- Daddy!
- Whoa, hold it.

1261
01:34:16,519 --> 01:34:18,312
That's enough.

1262
01:34:18,395 --> 01:34:21,649
- Guess we won't be needing this anymore.
- Uh-huh!

1263
01:34:21,690 --> 01:34:24,985
And, oh, look at this.
Ring, ring. Won't need this.

1264
01:34:25,027 --> 01:34:27,112
Got the ending
figured out yet, Sid?

1265
01:34:27,196 --> 01:34:29,240
Come on, Sidney.
You think about it now, huh?

1266
01:34:29,323 --> 01:34:32,076
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.

1267
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:35,538
- The evidence is all right there, baby!
- What if your father snapped?

1268
01:34:35,621 --> 01:34:38,832
Your mother's anniversary
set him off, and he went on
a murder spree, killing everyone.

1269
01:34:38,874 --> 01:34:41,168
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.

1270
01:34:41,210 --> 01:34:44,338
Then he... kills you...

1271
01:34:44,421 --> 01:34:47,091
and shoots himself
in the head.

1272
01:34:47,174 --> 01:34:50,010
- Perfect ending.
- I thought of that.

1273
01:34:50,052 --> 01:34:52,012
Watch this.

1274
01:34:56,016 --> 01:35:00,354
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah! I'm ready, baby!

1275
01:35:00,396 --> 01:35:05,192
Right! Get up!
Yeah, babe, get up! Hit it!

1276
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:12,533
Good one, man. Jesus.

1277
01:35:12,616 --> 01:35:14,326
Oh, shit.

1278
01:35:14,410 --> 01:35:16,662
My turn.

1279
01:35:18,414 --> 01:35:21,834
Don't forget. Stay to the side
and don't go too deep.

1280
01:35:22,918 --> 01:35:25,546
Okay. I'll remember.

1281
01:35:26,589 --> 01:35:30,050
Aaah! Fuck! Fuck!

1282
01:35:30,092 --> 01:35:32,553
Fuck! Goddamn it, Stu!

1283
01:35:32,636 --> 01:35:35,681
Sorry, Billy. I guess I got
a little too zealous, huh?

1284
01:35:35,764 --> 01:35:38,767
- Give me the knife.
- No.

1285
01:35:38,851 --> 01:35:41,729
Give me the knife!

1286
01:35:44,607 --> 01:35:46,525
Now!

1287
01:35:48,819 --> 01:35:53,574
You see, Sid, everybody dies but us.
Everybody dies but us.

1288
01:35:53,616 --> 01:35:56,243
We get to carry on
and plan the sequel,

1289
01:35:56,327 --> 01:36:00,581
'cause let's face it, baby,
these days ya gotta have a sequel!

1290
01:36:03,334 --> 01:36:06,212
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.

1291
01:36:06,295 --> 01:36:08,756
Now, Sid, don't you
blame the movies.

1292
01:36:08,839 --> 01:36:12,593
Movies don't create psychos.
Movies make psychos more creative!

1293
01:36:12,635 --> 01:36:16,305
Stop it, Billy,
would you? All right?

1294
01:36:16,388 --> 01:36:20,100
I can't take any more.
I feel a little woozy here!

1295
01:36:22,853 --> 01:36:26,815
All right. All right,
you get the gun.

1296
01:36:26,899 --> 01:36:28,776
I'll untie Pops, okay?

1297
01:36:32,196 --> 01:36:35,407
- Now!
- Okay.

1298
01:36:44,500 --> 01:36:47,086
Um. Uh...

1299
01:36:47,169 --> 01:36:50,798
Houston, we...
we have a problem here.

1300
01:36:52,842 --> 01:36:55,427
- What?
- The gun, man. The gun.

1301
01:36:55,511 --> 01:36:59,098
I put it right there,
and it's not there.

1302
01:36:59,181 --> 01:37:02,434
- Where the fuck is it?
- Right here, asshole.

1303
01:37:04,019 --> 01:37:07,523
- Man, I thought she was dead.
- She looked dead, man.

1304
01:37:07,606 --> 01:37:10,359
- Still does.
- I've got an ending for you.

1305
01:37:10,442 --> 01:37:13,445
The reporter left for dead
in the news van...

1306
01:37:13,529 --> 01:37:15,573
comes to,

1307
01:37:15,656 --> 01:37:17,992
stumbles on
you two dipshits,

1308
01:37:18,033 --> 01:37:20,160
finds the gun,

1309
01:37:20,244 --> 01:37:23,998
foils your plan
and saves the day.

1310
01:37:24,039 --> 01:37:26,500
I like that ending.

1311
01:37:27,877 --> 01:37:30,045
I know something you don't.

1312
01:37:33,424 --> 01:37:36,093
Fuck. No!

1313
01:37:38,888 --> 01:37:41,182
Yeah, man.

1314
01:37:41,265 --> 01:37:45,019
Yeah. Aw, so sweet.

1315
01:37:50,149 --> 01:37:54,653
- It works better
without the safety on.

1316
01:37:59,992 --> 01:38:03,078
This is Gale Weathers signing off.

1317
01:38:03,162 --> 01:38:05,539
Babe, you're gonna love this!

1318
01:38:07,833 --> 01:38:09,752
Shit.

1319
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:13,339
What?

1320
01:38:19,178 --> 01:38:21,597
- Where are they?
Where are they?

1321
01:38:21,680 --> 01:38:23,682
I don't know,
but I'm hurtin', man.

1322
01:38:23,766 --> 01:38:26,185
- Fuck!

1323
01:38:26,268 --> 01:38:30,689
Shall I let the machine get it?

1324
01:38:30,773 --> 01:38:33,567
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?

1325
01:38:33,609 --> 01:38:35,903
Bitch! You bitch!
Where the fuck are you?

1326
01:38:35,986 --> 01:38:38,906
Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.

1327
01:38:38,989 --> 01:38:43,869
It's called "Guess Who Just
Called The Police And Reported
Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass."

1328
01:38:43,953 --> 01:38:47,581
- Find her, you dipshit. Get up.
- I can't, Billy. You cut me too deep.

1329
01:38:47,623 --> 01:38:51,418
I think I'm dying here, man.

1330
01:38:51,502 --> 01:38:54,922
- Talk to her. Talk to her.

1331
01:39:01,804 --> 01:39:06,600
- Hello.
- Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu.
What's your motive?

1332
01:39:06,642 --> 01:39:09,728
Billy's got one. The police are on
their way. What are you gonna tell them?

1333
01:39:09,812 --> 01:39:12,231
Peer pressure.
I'm far too sensitive.

1334
01:39:12,314 --> 01:39:15,734
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch,
just like your fucking mother!

1335
01:39:15,818 --> 01:39:18,529
- You've gotta find me first,
you pansy-assed mama's boy!
- Fuck!

1336
01:39:18,612 --> 01:39:21,448
Ow. You fuckin' hit me
with the phone, dick!

1337
01:39:21,532 --> 01:39:24,159
- Fucker, where are you?

1338
01:39:26,328 --> 01:39:29,874
- You fuck!

1339
01:39:29,957 --> 01:39:33,878
- Did you really call the police?
- You bet your sorry ass I did.

1340
01:39:33,961 --> 01:39:37,256
My mom and dad
are gonna be so mad at me.

1341
01:39:37,339 --> 01:39:40,384
Aaah! Bitch!

1342
01:40:09,246 --> 01:40:11,540
Aaah!

1343
01:40:14,585 --> 01:40:17,296
Aaah!

1344
01:40:34,021 --> 01:40:37,274
Aah!

1345
01:40:37,358 --> 01:40:39,485
Ohh! My arm!

1346
01:40:46,450 --> 01:40:48,869
I always had a thing for ya, Sid!

1347
01:40:54,583 --> 01:40:58,170
- Bitch.
- In your dreams.

1348
01:41:22,695 --> 01:41:24,613
- I'm sorry. It's all right.

1349
01:41:24,697 --> 01:41:26,782
Oh, my God, Randy,
I thought you were dead.

1350
01:41:26,866 --> 01:41:29,869
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.

1351
01:41:29,952 --> 01:41:32,121
- Fucker!

1352
01:41:37,793 --> 01:41:40,754
- Say hello to your mother.

1353
01:41:47,511 --> 01:41:50,848
Aaah!

1354
01:42:16,373 --> 01:42:18,292
It's okay.

1355
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:24,048
Guess I remembered
the safety that time, you bastard.

1356
01:42:36,393 --> 01:42:38,312
Careful.

1357
01:42:38,395 --> 01:42:42,024
This is the moment when the supposedly
dead killer comes back to life...

1358
01:42:42,107 --> 01:42:44,026
for one last scare.

1359
01:42:48,364 --> 01:42:51,992
Not in my movie.

1360
01:42:56,038 --> 01:42:57,665
Dad.

1361
01:42:57,748 --> 01:43:00,292
Randy, help me out.

1362
01:43:04,046 --> 01:43:06,006
- Ow. Aah.
- Are you okay?

1363
01:43:08,425 --> 01:43:11,178
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1364
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:16,308
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.

1365
01:43:16,350 --> 01:43:18,310
- Over here.
- Sorry, kid.

1366
01:43:18,352 --> 01:43:22,481
Okay, I think it's going to go
something like this. Just stay with me.

1367
01:43:22,565 --> 01:43:25,526
- Hi, this is Gale Weathers...

1368
01:43:25,609 --> 01:43:30,573
with an exclusive eyewitness account
of this amazing breaking story.

1369
01:43:30,656 --> 01:43:33,075
Several more local teens
are dead...

1370
01:43:33,158 --> 01:43:36,078
bringing to an end the harrowing mystery
of the mass killing...

1371
01:43:36,161 --> 01:43:38,747
that has terrified
this peaceful community...

1372
01:43:38,831 --> 01:43:41,542
like the plot
of some scary movie.

1373
01:43:41,584 --> 01:43:44,170
It all began with
a scream over 9-1-1...

1374
01:43:44,211 --> 01:43:48,507
and ended in a bloodbath
that has rocked the town of Woodsboro,

1375
01:43:48,591 --> 01:43:51,093
all played out here
in this peaceful farmhouse...

1376
01:43:51,177 --> 01:43:53,762
far from the crimes and the sirens
of the larger cities...

1377
01:43:53,846 --> 01:43:55,931
that its residents had fled.

1378
01:43:56,015 --> 01:43:58,684
Okay, let's take it back
to one. Come on. Move it.

1379
01:43:58,767 --> 01:44:01,437
This is my big shot. Let's go.

1380
01:44:34,094 --> 01:44:38,265
Love comes down upon us
and it flows like water

1381
01:44:38,307 --> 01:44:42,478
Burning with the hope
of insight

1382
01:44:42,561 --> 01:44:46,565
There the books, the colors
of a bright elation

1383
01:44:46,649 --> 01:44:50,736
Stolen in the sight of love

1384
01:44:50,819 --> 01:44:54,949
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1385
01:44:54,990 --> 01:44:59,119
Fighting our way
around indecision

1386
01:44:59,161 --> 01:45:03,290
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1387
01:45:03,332 --> 01:45:10,172
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1388
01:45:15,845 --> 01:45:19,890
Birds fly in the eye
of the faithless daughters

1389
01:45:19,974 --> 01:45:24,144
Spoken at the bitter end

1390
01:45:24,186 --> 01:45:28,315
Wasted, sacrificed
for the new nirvana

1391
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:32,570
Nighttime sends us all above

1392
01:45:32,653 --> 01:45:36,615
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1393
01:45:36,699 --> 01:45:40,744
Fighting our way
around indecision

1394
01:45:40,828 --> 01:45:44,999
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1395
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:51,088
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1396
01:45:51,172 --> 01:45:55,634
A whisper to a scream

1397
01:45:55,676 --> 01:45:59,597
Whisper to a scream

1398
01:45:59,680 --> 01:46:06,020
A whisper to a scream

1399
01:46:14,236 --> 01:46:18,282
We are, we are, we are
We're just children

1400
01:46:18,365 --> 01:46:22,536
Fighting our way
around indecision

1401
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:26,707
We are, we are, we are
rather helpless

1402
01:46:26,790 --> 01:46:31,045
Stay kids forever
A whisper to a scream

1403
01:46:31,128 --> 01:46:35,174
- Whisper to a scream
- A whisper to a scream

1404
01:46:35,257 --> 01:46:39,386
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1405
01:46:39,470 --> 01:46:43,557
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1406
01:46:43,641 --> 01:46:47,728
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1407
01:46:47,811 --> 01:46:51,899
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1408
01:46:51,982 --> 01:46:56,070
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1409
01:46:56,153 --> 01:47:02,117
- Whisper to a scream
- Whisper to a scream

1410
01:47:02,201 --> 01:47:05,996
Whisper to a scream

1411
01:48:55,231 --> 01:48:59,151
Look outside of my window

1412
01:49:01,278 --> 01:49:05,157
But all I see
is the rain come down

1413
01:49:06,700 --> 01:49:11,539
A pink umbrella
and a bit of her lace

1414
01:49:11,622 --> 01:49:16,919
Is all I need
and I'll come, come

1415
01:49:17,002 --> 01:49:21,131
I don't care
if you don't care

1416
01:49:22,466 --> 01:49:25,761
The world looks
just fine to me

1417
01:49:27,847 --> 01:49:33,060
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1418
01:49:33,102 --> 01:49:37,690
What's it like to be free

1419
01:49:45,114 --> 01:49:50,327
I don't care
if you don't care

1420
01:49:50,411 --> 01:49:54,123
The world looks
just fine to me

1421
01:49:55,833 --> 01:50:01,046
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1422
01:50:01,088 --> 01:50:06,760
What it's like to be free

1423
01:50:17,104 --> 01:50:22,401
I don't care
if you don't care

1424
01:50:22,484 --> 01:50:26,155
The world looks
just fine to me

1425
01:50:27,781 --> 01:50:32,995
Don't be shy
and I'll show you, baby

1426
01:50:33,078 --> 01:50:39,376
What it's like to be free

1427
01:50:49,428 --> 01:50:52,556
- Don't be shy
- Told you, baby

1428
01:50:52,640 --> 01:50:55,142
Don't be shy

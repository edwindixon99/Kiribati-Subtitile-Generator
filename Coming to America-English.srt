1
00:03:40,728 --> 00:03:44,231
Good morning, your Highness.

2
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,943
Good morning, your Highness.

3
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:51,447
Good morning, your Highness.

4
00:03:51,655 --> 00:03:57,870
- Happy birthday, your Highness.
- Yes, it is my birthday.

5
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:39,203
Oha, it is my 21st birthday.

6
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:43,916
Do you think, just once,
I might use the bathroom by myself?

7
00:04:44,124 --> 00:04:47,962
Most amusing, sir.
Wipers!

8
00:05:06,605 --> 00:05:09,316
The royal penis is clean,
your Highness.

9
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:09,543
His Highness
must be very excited today.

10
00:06:09,752 --> 00:06:13,547
Today is your 21st birthday.
It means you meet your wife-to-be.

11
00:06:13,756 --> 00:06:17,009
How can a man get excited
about a woman he's never seen?

12
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:03,347
He certainly is quiet this morning.

13
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:06,267
He looks sad.

14
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:14,525
- Is something troubling you, my son?
- No, Father.

15
00:07:15,943 --> 00:07:22,283
I'm more than the exalted ruler
of this land and master of all I survey.

16
00:07:22,491 --> 00:07:25,369
I'm also a concerned dad.

17
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:31,875
Well, Father... Just a moment.

18
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:36,130
- What is he doing?
- It looks as if he's coming here.

19
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:39,883
Wait right there, Akeem.

20
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:41,885
Rose bearers!

21
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,187
Akeem. Come sit.

22
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:08,412
Now, my son...
Have you grown a moustache?

23
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:11,498
Jaffe, it has been a year.

24
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:17,671
- So, what is it, my son?
- First of all, things like this.

25
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,883
- Like what?
- The rose petals.

26
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:25,804
You're the son of a king, why shouldn'
you walk on the petals of roses?

27
00:08:26,013 --> 00:08:29,433
But if there were no rose petals,
I would still be the son of a king.

28
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:32,853
Then it is settled. From this day forth,

29
00:08:33,062 --> 00:08:38,817
anyone who throws roses
at my son's feet will answer to me.

30
00:08:39,026 --> 00:08:41,528
It is not just that, it is everything.

31
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:46,241
The cooking, the pampering,
the dressing, the bathing...

32
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,119
Actually, I rather enjoy the bathing,

33
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:54,124
but I'd like to cook for myself,
dress myself, wipe my own backside.

34
00:08:54,333 --> 00:09:00,005
- And why can't I find my own wife?
- Aha! So that's it?

35
00:09:00,214 --> 00:09:05,052
We've gone through a lot of trouble
to select for you a very fine wife.

36
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:10,432
Since she was born, she was taught
to walk, speak and think as a queen.

37
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:14,603
But what if I don't love her?

38
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:17,982
It's normal to feel anxiety
about meeting your queen.

39
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:20,818
When I met your father, I was terrified.

40
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:23,988
I must admit, I was frightened, too.

41
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:27,616
I was so nervous, I became nauseous.

42
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:31,870
But over the years, I have grown
to love your father very much.

43
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:36,542
You see, my son, there's a fine line
between love and nausea.

44
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,878
I understand, but when I marry,

45
00:09:40,087 --> 00:09:44,258
I want the woman to love me
for who I am, not because of what I am.

46
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:48,721
- And who are you?
- A man who's never tied his shoes.

47
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:53,517
Wrong! You're a prince
who's never tied his shoes.

48
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:59,273
I tied my own shoes once.
It is an overrated experience.

49
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:04,987
Good morning, your Majesty.
It's another beautiful day in Zamunda.

50
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:07,740
And, Semmi, what is it now?

51
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:14,330
You look especially radiant today,
your Grace.

52
00:10:14,538 --> 00:10:20,586
I was remarking to my mother the other
day what lovely skin the Queen has.

53
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:23,881
Semmi, don't you have somewhere
you should go?

54
00:10:25,507 --> 00:10:29,053
Yes, I was about to take the birthday
boy for his daily workout.

55
00:10:29,261 --> 00:10:32,181
Excuse me, Father. And Mother.

56
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:38,270
Have a good day, my son.

57
00:10:40,648 --> 00:10:43,484
Akeem, what happened
to the rose bearers?

58
00:10:46,695 --> 00:10:51,909
Let's see if you can defend yourself,
you sweat from a baboon's balls.

59
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:15,516
So you can have a woman
who will obey your every command,

60
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:19,186
but you'd rather have a woman
who has an opinion?

61
00:11:19,395 --> 00:11:23,857
Only dogs are to obey. If you love
your wife, you'll value her opinion.

62
00:11:30,948 --> 00:11:34,743
Hippopotamus shit! You're the heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

63
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:40,791
Your wife need only have a pretty face,
firm backside and big breasts.

64
00:11:55,055 --> 00:11:58,892
So you would share your bed,
and your fortune, with a beautiful fool

65
00:11:59,101 --> 00:12:03,355
That's the way it's always been
with men of power. It's tradition.

66
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:10,529
It's also tradition
that times must change.

67
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:34,887
Get your Royal Engagement T-shirt!
Step up and get your Royal T-shirt!

68
00:13:16,637 --> 00:13:21,016
- These really are delicious.
- Yes, thank you.

69
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:31,402
Your Majesty.

70
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:34,613
I am Colonel Issy.

71
00:13:34,822 --> 00:13:41,078
And today, with your blessing,
I offer my daughter to your son.

72
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:48,419
My blessing is granted.
Let the courtship commence.

73
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:55,259
Pardon me. Step aside, please. Coming
through. Excuse me. Out of the way!

74
00:13:58,554 --> 00:14:04,101
Greetings, great Prince.
Presenting Miss Imani Issi.

75
00:16:12,187 --> 00:16:18,611
She's your Queen-to-be

76
00:16:18,819 --> 00:16:23,240
A Queen-to-be forever

77
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:26,994
A Queen who'll do whatever

78
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:31,915
His Highness desires

79
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:38,297
She's your Queen-to-be

80
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:42,885
A vision of perfection

81
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:46,305
Ah object of affection

82
00:16:46,513 --> 00:16:51,143
To quench your royal fire

83
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:57,483
Completely free from infection

84
00:16:57,691 --> 00:17:01,028
To be used at your discretion

85
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:07,785
Waiting only for your direction

86
00:17:09,036 --> 00:17:17,336
Your Queen-to-be

87
00:17:34,311 --> 00:17:38,315
May I talk to you alone
for a moment, please?

88
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,406
Excuse us for a moment.

89
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:20,274
- So...
- Am I not all you dreamed I would be?

90
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:22,192
You're fine. Beautiful

91
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:27,072
But if we're going to be married, we
should talk and get to know each other.

92
00:18:27,281 --> 00:18:31,744
Ever since I was born,
I have been trained to serve you.

93
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:36,582
I know, but I'd like to know about you.
What do you like to do?

94
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:39,752
Whatever you like.

95
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,673
- What kind of music do you like?
- Whatever kind of music you like.

96
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:50,095
I know what I like, and you know what
I like, 'cause you were trained to know,

97
00:18:50,304 --> 00:18:54,224
but I would like to know what you like.
Do you have a favourite food?

98
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,894
Good! What is your favourite food?

99
00:18:57,102 --> 00:18:59,980
Whatever food you like.

100
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:05,486
This is impossible.
I command you not to obey me.

101
00:19:05,694 --> 00:19:07,821
No.

102
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:13,118
Are you saying that no matter
what I tell you to do, you will do?

103
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:15,204
Yes, your Highness.

104
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:19,458
- Ahything I say, you'll do?
- Yes, your Highness.

105
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,127
Bark like a dog.

106
00:19:25,089 --> 00:19:27,258
A big dog.

107
00:19:30,177 --> 00:19:32,846
Hop on one leg.

108
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:38,102
Make a noise like an orang-utan.

109
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:44,692
I see the two of you are getting along.

110
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:50,698
Excuse me, Imani, for a moment.

111
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:04,545
Fine girl, isn't she?
I told you not to worry.

112
00:20:05,588 --> 00:20:07,548
Father...

113
00:20:11,218 --> 00:20:13,971
About this wedding...

114
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,432
The guests are waiting, your Majesty.

115
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,395
Let them wait! I'm talking to my son.

116
00:20:23,063 --> 00:20:25,399
Come. Let's go for a stroll.

117
00:20:38,495 --> 00:20:41,165
Hello, Babar.

118
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:52,051
Time flies. It seems only yesterday
I ordered your first diaper changed,

119
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:56,388
and now you're a man
who's about to be married.

120
00:20:56,597 --> 00:21:00,309
She will give you much pleasure,
don't you think?

121
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,687
I'm not sure if I'm ready.

122
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:07,524
I know we never had a talk about this,

123
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:12,947
but I always assumed you had sex
with your bathers. I know I do.

124
00:21:13,155 --> 00:21:19,078
It's not that. I'm 21 years old,
and I have never left Zamunda.

125
00:21:19,286 --> 00:21:23,332
I have yet to experience
what the outside world has to offer.

126
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,419
- So you want to sow your royal oats?
- No, it's not that...

127
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:31,382
You're right! Get out, see the world.
Enjoy yourself.

128
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:36,929
Fulfil every erotic desire,
and in 40 days, you will marry Imani.

129
00:21:37,137 --> 00:21:40,057
- But, Father...
- it is settled.

130
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:58,117
May I have your attention, please?

131
00:21:59,618 --> 00:22:03,747
The wedding will proceed in 40 days.
You may go home now. Good night.

132
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:07,960
Oha. Prepare the royal baggage.
My son is going on a trip.

133
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:14,133
Prepare the royal baggage!

134
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:20,806
This trip is an excellent idea.
40 days of fornication.

135
00:22:21,015 --> 00:22:27,021
Semmi. I have something else in mind.
I intend to find my bride.

136
00:22:28,022 --> 00:22:33,110
What is wrong with the one you have?
Didn't you want to rip her clothes off?

137
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,780
I want a woman who will arouse
my intellect as well as my loins.

138
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:39,950
- Where would you find such a woman?
- In America.

139
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:46,415
The land is so big,
the choices so infinite.

140
00:22:46,624 --> 00:22:50,961
Where shall we go?
Los Ahgeles or New York?

141
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:53,881
We'll let fate decide.

142
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,928
Heads, New York. Tails, Los Ahgeles.

143
00:23:01,972 --> 00:23:04,808
We go to New York.

144
00:23:05,017 --> 00:23:09,396
But where in New York can one find
a woman with grace and elegance?

145
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:12,232
A woman suitable for a king.

146
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:17,446
Queens!

147
00:23:33,629 --> 00:23:38,634
Mr Frank Oznowitz. Please p¡ck up
a white courtesy telephone.

148
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:48,143
No one here can know I am royalty.
I must appear as an average man.

149
00:23:48,352 --> 00:23:51,063
I will not say a word.

150
00:24:04,952 --> 00:24:07,037
Halt!

151
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:10,541
You dumb fuck!

152
00:24:15,045 --> 00:24:17,673
Take us to Queens at once.

153
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:26,515
Do you want to go to Queens?
Rich fellows should be in Manhattan.

154
00:24:26,724 --> 00:24:28,767
Stay at the Waldorf or the Palace.

155
00:24:28,976 --> 00:24:32,855
- Take us to the Palace.
- No, I want Queens.

156
00:24:33,063 --> 00:24:37,109
And we're not rich.
We're ordinary African students.

157
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:40,195
Whatever you say, pal

158
00:24:40,404 --> 00:24:45,784
- What part of Queens do you want?
- Take us to the most common part.

159
00:24:46,535 --> 00:24:51,832
That's easy. If there's one thing
Queens got a lot of, it's common parts.

160
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,378
What does "dumb fuck" mean?

161
00:25:26,951 --> 00:25:30,496
- Is this shitty enough for you?
- Yes, this is perfect.

162
00:26:07,116 --> 00:26:11,578
Fascinating! Semmi, look at this.

163
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:19,837
America is great indeed. A country so
free, one can throw glass on the street.

164
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:23,549
You must be
out of your goddamn m¡nd!

165
00:26:25,593 --> 00:26:27,219
Listen. Real Americans.

166
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:31,599
Sugar Ray Robinson's
the greatest fighter that ever lived.

167
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:35,185
- What about Joe Louis?
- "The Brown Bomber".

168
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:38,689
- That was a great boxer.
- You're damn right.

169
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:41,775
I suppose nobody in here
ever heard of Cassius Clay.

170
00:26:41,984 --> 00:26:44,695
He's got a point. Cassius Clay
was a bad motherfucker.

171
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,280
I ain't saying Clay ain't bad.

172
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:51,285
I stopped liking him when he changed
his name to Muhammad Ali.

173
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:53,579
Wait a second. Wait a second.

174
00:26:53,787 --> 00:26:59,043
A man has the right to change his name
to whatever he wants to change it to.

175
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:02,504
And if a man wants to be called
Muhammad Ali,

176
00:27:02,713 --> 00:27:08,594
you should respect his wishes
and call the man Muhammad Ali.

177
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:12,473
His momma named him Clay.
I'm going to call him Clay.

178
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:16,018
- I say Clay.
- Get out of here.

179
00:27:16,226 --> 00:27:21,565
He'll always be Clay to me. I don'
care what he change his name to.

180
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:25,027
Well, then you're a putz.
The three of you. Three putzes.

181
00:27:25,235 --> 00:27:29,949
You should change the name from
"My-T-Sharp" to "The Three Putzes".

182
00:27:41,835 --> 00:27:46,048
- What the fuck do you want?
- We desire a room.

183
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:49,885
You'd better not be wasting my time.
You got money?

184
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,056
Come on in, gentlemen.

185
00:27:56,809 --> 00:27:59,603
Yo, man! Get the big bag.

186
00:28:03,732 --> 00:28:09,321
Excuse me if I was brusque, but we
get boo-boos in here without a dollar.

187
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:13,659
Obviously, you gentlemen
came in on another boat.

188
00:28:13,867 --> 00:28:17,371
- We seek meagre accommodations.
- Excuse me?

189
00:28:17,579 --> 00:28:20,124
We require a room that is very poor.

190
00:28:25,254 --> 00:28:27,923
Hey, Stu.
Your rent's due, motherfucker.

191
00:28:28,132 --> 00:28:33,512
And don't pull that falling down the stairs
shit on me. You're conscious.

192
00:28:33,721 --> 00:28:36,974
Every month, the same damn thing...

193
00:28:54,241 --> 00:28:56,702
Here we are.

194
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:02,541
There's only one bathroom on this floor,
so you have to share it.

195
00:29:05,169 --> 00:29:10,507
Got a bit of an insect problem, but
you boys from Africa are used to that.

196
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,846
And don't use the elevator.
It's a death trap.

197
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:20,684
This is the place that I was
telling you about. It's real fucked up.

198
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:25,940
The window faces a brick wall.
I used to rent it to a blind man.

199
00:29:34,615 --> 00:29:38,535
It's a damn shame
what they did to that dog.

200
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:46,210
We will take the room.

201
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:48,796
Yes.

202
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:06,939
Behold, Semmi! Life. Real life.

203
00:30:07,147 --> 00:30:10,693
A thing that we have been denied
for far too long.

204
00:30:12,903 --> 00:30:16,240
- Good morn¡ng, my ne¡ghbours!
- Fuck you!

205
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:21,578
Yes! Yes! Fuck you, too!

206
00:30:40,556 --> 00:30:44,852
I suspect that these are the people
that have stolen our luggage.

207
00:30:50,274 --> 00:30:52,109
Do you want to buy
some toothbrushes?

208
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:57,531
I've got some real fly personal
hygiene products, and a hair-dryer.

209
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,243
Thief! Stop thief! Come back, thief!

210
00:31:01,452 --> 00:31:04,496
- Semmi, let him go.
- Those things belong to us.

211
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:08,918
It's good we're rid of those things.
Let them wear our princely robes.

212
00:31:09,126 --> 00:31:13,255
We're in New York now.
Let us dress as New Yorkers.

213
00:31:19,219 --> 00:31:24,141
- I feel like a complete idiot.
- Don't be ridiculous.

214
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:30,773
You know, you can be all the th¡ngs
you've always wanted to be.

215
00:31:30,981 --> 00:31:33,943
Beautiful, sexy...

216
00:31:34,568 --> 00:31:37,488
One, two, three...

217
00:31:58,425 --> 00:31:59,969
Soul Glo.

218
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:04,974
Perhaps I should cut off
my prince's lock.

219
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:10,062
You're out of your mind! Joe Louis
is the greatest boxer that ever lived.

220
00:32:10,271 --> 00:32:11,689
I'll be with you in a minute.

221
00:32:11,897 --> 00:32:17,486
He was better than Clay, Sugar Ray
and that new boy - Mike Tyson.

222
00:32:17,695 --> 00:32:20,906
He was better than him, too.
He'd whip all their asses!

223
00:32:21,782 --> 00:32:25,953
- What about Rocky Marciano?
- There they go. There they go.

224
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:31,083
Every time I talk about boxing, a white
man pulls Rocky Marciano out his ass.

225
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:34,587
That's their one, that's their one.
"Rocky Marciano, Rocky Marciano!"

226
00:32:34,795 --> 00:32:37,756
Let me tell you something.
Rocky Marciano was good,

227
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:41,468
but compared to Joe Louis,
Rocky Marciano ain't shit!

228
00:32:41,677 --> 00:32:43,971
He beat Joe Louis' ass.

229
00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:48,934
- He did whop Joe Louis' ass.
- Joe Louis was 75 years old!

230
00:32:49,143 --> 00:32:51,103
I don't know how old he was,
but he got his ass whooped.

231
00:32:51,312 --> 00:32:55,482
Joe Louis came out of retirement
to fight Marciano. He was 76 years old.

232
00:32:55,691 --> 00:32:58,402
Joe Louis always lied about his age.

233
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:00,779
Once, Frank Sinatra sat in this chair.

234
00:33:00,988 --> 00:33:04,241
I said, "Y ou hang out with Joe Louis.
How old is he?"

235
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:09,204
Frank said,
"Joe Louis is 137 years old".

236
00:33:09,413 --> 00:33:12,791
Oh, man.
You ain't never met no Frank Sinatra.

237
00:33:14,627 --> 00:33:18,005
Fuck you, fuck you and fuck you!
Who's next?

238
00:33:26,847 --> 00:33:29,183
What's that? Some kind
of weave or something?

239
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:32,353
It's my natural hair.
I've been growing it since birth.

240
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,981
What kind of chemicals
you got in there?

241
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,276
None, only juices and berries.

242
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:43,530
That ain't nothing but Ultra-Perm.
How do you want it cut?

243
00:33:45,658 --> 00:33:48,410
Just make it nice and neat.

244
00:33:57,044 --> 00:33:59,922
That'll be 8 dollars.

245
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:11,850
Tell me, Semmi. Honestly...
How do I look?

246
00:34:15,354 --> 00:34:17,022
It is time to find your queen.

247
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:51,557
I've got a secret.

248
00:34:51,765 --> 00:34:54,476
I worship the devil

249
00:34:58,981 --> 00:35:04,236
See, that's the problem.
I can't find a man that can satisfy me.

250
00:35:04,445 --> 00:35:07,865
Some guys go an hour,
hour and a half. That's it.

251
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:12,870
A man's got to put in overtime
for me to get off.

252
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:16,749
I'm not interested in a man
unless he drives a B.M.W.

253
00:35:16,957 --> 00:35:21,420
Well, you know, baby, I'm almost single.
My husband's on Death Row.

254
00:35:21,629 --> 00:35:27,801
This is the first date Teresa and I have
been on since the doctor separated us.

255
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:32,514
I'm into the group thing.

256
00:35:34,308 --> 00:35:37,686
I was Joan of Arc in my former life.

257
00:35:41,774 --> 00:35:44,068
My name is Peaches
And I'm the best

258
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:47,154
All the D.J. S want
to feel my breasts

259
00:35:52,242 --> 00:35:55,829
I want to work in videos, but I want to be
my own star in the video,

260
00:35:56,038 --> 00:36:01,335
because I want to be a pop singer,
a rock singer, and write my own songs.

261
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:06,215
And then I'm going to try an actress,
'cause people tell me I'm a natural

262
00:36:06,423 --> 00:36:11,637
Then I'm going to write and direct
my own stories, produce the movies...

263
00:36:25,276 --> 00:36:27,861
I hope you don't mind me coming over
and sitting down.

264
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:33,450
But I've been watching you all evening,
and I want to tear you apart.

265
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:37,997
And your friend, too.

266
00:36:41,584 --> 00:36:47,131
Does every woman in New York
have a severe emotional problem?

267
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:50,301
I doubt we will ever find your queen.

268
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:57,182
- Mr Clarence.
- The boys from Africa! How are you?

269
00:36:57,808 --> 00:37:03,022
- Where can one find nice women here?
- You've got to get out and look.

270
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,232
We've been to every bar in Queens.

271
00:37:05,441 --> 00:37:08,068
You can't go to no bar
to find a nice woman.

272
00:37:08,277 --> 00:37:13,824
You've got to go to nice places,
like the library and church.

273
00:37:14,033 --> 00:37:17,244
Or this place, where I'm going tonight.
The Black Awareness Rally.

274
00:37:17,453 --> 00:37:20,789
There's going to be
some fine women there. Clean girls.

275
00:37:28,213 --> 00:37:31,383
I didn't come here
to preach to you today.

276
00:37:36,305 --> 00:37:42,394
But when I look at these contestants
for The Miss Black Awareness pageant,

277
00:37:42,603 --> 00:37:48,317
I feel good, 'cause I know
there's a God somewhere.

278
00:37:48,525 --> 00:37:50,611
There's a God somewhere.

279
00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:53,030
Turn around, ladies.

280
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:57,660
You know there's a God
who sits up high, and looks down low.

281
00:37:57,868 --> 00:38:00,537
Man cannot make it like this.

282
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:04,124
Larry Flint, Hugh Hefner...
They can take the picture,

283
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:09,838
but they can't make it.
Only God above can make it for ya.

284
00:38:10,047 --> 00:38:15,135
These are the best women Queens has
to offer. Pick one, and let's go home.

285
00:38:15,344 --> 00:38:17,137
Be patient, my friend.

286
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:21,267
Do you love him? Do you feel joy?
Say "joy"!

287
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:24,103
- Joy!
- Joy.

288
00:38:24,311 --> 00:38:25,980
- Joy!
- Joy!

289
00:38:26,188 --> 00:38:31,318
- Can I get a "Amen"?
- Amen, brother!

290
00:38:31,527 --> 00:38:34,363
Don't be ashamed to call his name.

291
00:38:34,571 --> 00:38:35,906
Yes, Lord!

292
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:40,077
Only God can give that woman
that kind of joy.

293
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:45,583
- Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.
- Joy!

294
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:48,627
- I am very happy to be here.
- Amen!

295
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:54,174
Can I get a "Amen"?

296
00:38:55,551 --> 00:39:01,307
I don't know what you've come to do,
but I've come to praise His name.

297
00:39:02,766 --> 00:39:04,810
Lord, Lord...

298
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:10,858
Girls, you can leave now.
Thank you very much.

299
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:13,944
There's a God somewhere.

300
00:39:15,112 --> 00:39:17,990
I've got a special treat for you
this evening.

301
00:39:18,198 --> 00:39:22,202
A young man, that you all know
as Joe the policeman

302
00:39:22,411 --> 00:39:26,248
from the "What's Going Down"
episode of "That's My Momma".

303
00:39:26,457 --> 00:39:30,294
I want you to put your hands together
and welcome him to the stage.

304
00:39:30,502 --> 00:39:34,506
A big round of applause
for Jackson Height's own

305
00:39:34,715 --> 00:39:39,720
Mr Randy Watson! Randy Watson.

306
00:39:39,929 --> 00:39:43,599
- That boy's good.
- Good and terrible.

307
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:47,061
And Reverend Brown.

308
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:51,440
He's been my reverend since
I was a little boy, and I love him dearly.

309
00:39:51,649 --> 00:39:57,237
You're a very special man.
Reverend Brown! Reverend Brown.

310
00:39:58,572 --> 00:40:04,578
It feels so lovely to be here tonight.
Give yourselves a round of applause.

311
00:40:04,787 --> 00:40:09,708
Give a big round of applause
to my band, Sexual Chocolate.

312
00:40:13,671 --> 00:40:18,259
Sexual Chocolate.
They play so fine, don't you agree?

313
00:40:38,362 --> 00:40:42,491
- Some of the good stuff? Coming up.
- Do you want a Coke?

314
00:40:43,742 --> 00:40:47,871
- Enjoying the show?
- Enjoy, young man.

315
00:41:15,357 --> 00:41:18,152
Sexy Chocolate!

316
00:41:19,528 --> 00:41:20,863
Sexy Chocolate!

317
00:41:26,285 --> 00:41:30,581
- Goddamn, that boy can sing.
- You must be crazy.

318
00:41:39,798 --> 00:41:43,052
Put your hands together
for Mr Randy Watson.

319
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,222
Yeah, one more time!
Randy Watson, how about it!

320
00:41:47,431 --> 00:41:52,102
Before we go any further,
I'd like to thank Mr Cleo McDowell,

321
00:41:52,311 --> 00:41:56,857
who's responsible for the fine food
and beverage here tonight.

322
00:41:57,066 --> 00:42:00,736
Cleo, I know you're proud
of your daughters. We are, too.

323
00:42:00,945 --> 00:42:04,281
Please welcome one of the organisers
of tonight's festivities.

324
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,743
Miss Lisa McDowell.
Lisa, come up here, baby girl

325
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:12,581
- Work in a plug for the new salad bar.
- I'm not mentioning the restaurant.

326
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:15,793
At least give them the address.

327
00:42:19,463 --> 00:42:24,510
Someone ought to put you on a plate
and suck you up with a biscuit.

328
00:42:28,347 --> 00:42:34,144
Black Awareness Week is
an opportunity for self -expression.

329
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:37,189
- May we leave now?
- No, wait.

330
00:42:37,398 --> 00:42:43,362
...express himself through song.
In his own unique way, but...

331
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:46,323
The song makes a good point.

332
00:42:46,532 --> 00:42:49,034
The ch¡ldren are our future,

333
00:42:49,243 --> 00:42:54,248
and it's up to all of us to provide a place
where children can express themselves.

334
00:42:55,207 --> 00:42:58,627
We need to rebuild Lincoln Park.

335
00:42:59,503 --> 00:43:05,593
Ushers are passing with donation
baskets, so please - give all you can.

336
00:43:07,011 --> 00:43:10,472
We're happy to get
the kind of money that jingles,

337
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:13,350
but we'd rather get the kind that folds.

338
00:43:22,526 --> 00:43:25,904
- Donations. Donations!
- I thought it was the trash.

339
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:28,449
- Stupid ass.
- I'll whip your ass.

340
00:43:28,657 --> 00:43:34,079
- You tar-black motherfucker.
- There's women here. Calm down.

341
00:43:46,383 --> 00:43:48,552
Thank you.

342
00:43:52,431 --> 00:43:56,018
- She is wonderful
- Akeem...

343
00:43:56,727 --> 00:44:01,440
You can see Lisa, and Mr McDowell,
at McDowell's Restaurant,

344
00:44:01,649 --> 00:44:05,861
8507, Queens Boulevard.

345
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:08,697
8507, Queens Boulevard.

346
00:44:20,918 --> 00:44:24,463
Your first job every morning
will be to sweep this walkway.

347
00:44:24,672 --> 00:44:28,634
Then I want you to wash
all the windows. Real good, too.

348
00:44:28,842 --> 00:44:31,929
And don't leave no streaks.

349
00:44:35,015 --> 00:44:38,310
What are you doing?

350
00:44:39,853 --> 00:44:43,482
Get the hell out of here
before I bust that camera!

351
00:44:47,194 --> 00:44:52,449
Me and the McDonald's people,
we've got this little misunderstanding.

352
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,873
See, they're "McDonald's".
I'm "McDowell's".

353
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:06,922
They've got the golden arches.
Mine are the golden arcs.

354
00:45:09,883 --> 00:45:12,803
They've got the Big Mac.
I've got the Big Mick.

355
00:45:13,012 --> 00:45:17,516
We both got two all -beef patties, sauce,
lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions.

356
00:45:17,725 --> 00:45:23,564
But they use a sesame seed bun.
My buns have no seeds.

357
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:28,319
I've got it.

358
00:45:31,196 --> 00:45:35,534
You've got to mop the food-prep area
twice a day.

359
00:45:35,743 --> 00:45:39,288
- Do you know how to mop?
- Yes, of course.

360
00:45:40,164 --> 00:45:42,458
There you go.

361
00:45:56,138 --> 00:46:00,309
Don't use the bucket.
It'll just confuse you.

362
00:46:00,517 --> 00:46:04,772
When you get through here,
you take out the trash.

363
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,817
Come with me,
I've got an easy job for you.

364
00:46:39,473 --> 00:46:43,352
- Hi!
- Hello.

365
00:46:45,688 --> 00:46:47,940
Hello.

366
00:46:48,899 --> 00:46:51,360
Hi...

367
00:46:52,486 --> 00:46:54,947
I am Akeem.

368
00:46:56,574 --> 00:46:59,702
It's nice to meet you, Akeem.

369
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:05,374
I've been placed in charge of garbage.
Do you have any that needs disposal

370
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:08,836
No, it's totally empty.

371
00:47:09,962 --> 00:47:14,550
When it fills up, don't be afraid
to call me. I'll take it out urgently.

372
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:18,387
That's good to know.

373
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:22,558
When you think of garbage,
think of Akeem.

374
00:47:24,685 --> 00:47:28,355
Well, I have to get back
to my sanitation duties.

375
00:47:28,564 --> 00:47:33,652
Maybe we will have a chance
to talk again on a professional level

376
00:47:35,237 --> 00:47:37,531
Goodbye, Akeem.

377
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:39,969
Darryl You're looking sharp.

378
00:48:40,177 --> 00:48:44,390
How about a Mick-Shake?
I believe strawberry is your favourite.

379
00:48:44,598 --> 00:48:46,267
Straw.

380
00:48:46,475 --> 00:48:51,146
Lisa's in the back.
She's waiting for you. Come on.

381
00:48:53,148 --> 00:48:56,527
- How's everything at Soul Glo?
- Fine.

382
00:48:56,735 --> 00:48:59,947
Our home weave products
are really taking off.

383
00:49:00,155 --> 00:49:05,452
Dad isn't using the tickets for the Jets
game. I thought you might enjoy them.

384
00:49:05,661 --> 00:49:09,039
That's very considerate of you.
Thank you!

385
00:49:11,542 --> 00:49:15,212
- Lisa! Look who's here, honey.
- Hi!

386
00:49:15,421 --> 00:49:18,882
You two kids have a good time,
you hear?

387
00:49:23,596 --> 00:49:25,389
- Ready?
- Sure.

388
00:49:26,473 --> 00:49:28,892
I want to ask you something.

389
00:49:29,101 --> 00:49:34,732
At the rally, someone stuck a large
amount of cash in one of the boxes.

390
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,319
You wouldn't happen to know
who that was, would you?

391
00:49:40,404 --> 00:49:43,866
- Well, I...
- I thought it was you!

392
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:48,162
You know me. Ahything for the kids.

393
00:49:54,668 --> 00:49:57,296
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

394
00:50:00,591 --> 00:50:05,554
I got four tickets to the St. John's game.
Maybe your sister can bring someone.

395
00:50:05,763 --> 00:50:09,141
Take care of this, will you?

396
00:50:21,362 --> 00:50:24,573
- Excuse me.
- Hey, it's Kunta Kinte.

397
00:50:29,203 --> 00:50:31,664
What can I do you for?

398
00:50:34,708 --> 00:50:38,671
- Can you make my hair look like this?
- Why would you want that?

399
00:50:38,879 --> 00:50:41,048
I like your hair, it's natural

400
00:50:41,257 --> 00:50:45,177
I wish more children would wear their
hair natural, like Martin Luther King.

401
00:50:45,386 --> 00:50:51,183
You ain't never seen Martin Luther King
with no messy curls on his head.

402
00:50:51,392 --> 00:50:55,729
- I met Dr Martin Luther King once.
- You're lying, you ain't never met him.

403
00:50:55,938 --> 00:50:58,941
I met him in 1962
in Memphis, Tennessee.

404
00:50:59,149 --> 00:51:01,944
I'm walking down the street
minding my own business.

405
00:51:02,152 --> 00:51:04,863
I walk round the corner,
and a man hits me in the chest.

406
00:51:05,072 --> 00:51:07,658
I fall on the ground. I look up,
and it's Martin Luther King.

407
00:51:07,866 --> 00:51:11,370
I said, "Dr King." He said,
"Oops, I thought it was someone else."

408
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:14,415
- You never met Martin Luther King.
- He knocked me over.

409
00:51:14,623 --> 00:51:17,042
- No, he didn'.
- Yes, he did.

410
00:51:17,251 --> 00:51:19,086
Why do you worry about how you look?

411
00:51:19,295 --> 00:51:23,591
I'm trying to gain the interest
of a certain young lady.

412
00:51:23,799 --> 00:51:27,261
I ain't heard no woman give no man
no lovin' 'cause his hair looks good.

413
00:51:27,469 --> 00:51:31,098
- That's right.
- Is this an American girl

414
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:36,770
You got to go through her papa. People
don't know that about American women.

415
00:51:36,979 --> 00:51:38,814
Ain't nothing to do with your hair
or your pocket.

416
00:51:39,023 --> 00:51:43,402
You get in good with American
woman's father, you in good with her.

417
00:51:43,611 --> 00:51:46,947
Get in good with the father,
you home free.

418
00:51:47,156 --> 00:51:50,284
- Home free.
- Like a bird.

419
00:52:00,628 --> 00:52:03,505
- Mr McDowell.
- What is it?

420
00:52:04,465 --> 00:52:09,428
Sir, did you catch the professional
football contest on television last night?

421
00:52:10,888 --> 00:52:13,891
- No, I didn'.
- It was most exhilarating.

422
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:17,061
The Giants of New York
took on the Packers of Green Bay.

423
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:22,274
The Giants triumphed by kicking
an oblong pigskin ball through a big "H".

424
00:52:22,483 --> 00:52:24,568
It was a ripping victory.

425
00:52:26,862 --> 00:52:31,116
Son, and I'm just going
to tell you this one time.

426
00:52:31,325 --> 00:52:34,495
You want to keep working here,
stay off the drugs.

427
00:52:35,955 --> 00:52:38,374
Yes, sir.

428
00:52:43,754 --> 00:52:48,259
I don't know how it is in Africa,
but here rich guys get all the chicks.

429
00:52:53,681 --> 00:52:58,227
- He must work very hard.
- The Prince of Soul Glo?

430
00:52:58,435 --> 00:53:02,690
No way.
He lives off his father's invention.

431
00:53:02,898 --> 00:53:08,028
He can buy her anything he wants. How
are you going to compete with that?

432
00:53:35,264 --> 00:53:37,725
I'll get it.

433
00:53:45,357 --> 00:53:48,319
- Delivery for Miss Lisa McDowell.
- I'll take it, I'm her sister.

434
00:53:48,527 --> 00:53:51,155
Would you sign here, please?

435
00:53:59,413 --> 00:54:03,250
- What is it?
- Something for you.

436
00:54:03,459 --> 00:54:06,420
Do you mind if I open it?

437
00:54:10,674 --> 00:54:13,928
- Do you think they're real
- They couldn't be.

438
00:54:17,139 --> 00:54:20,392
"From an admirer. Not Darryl"

439
00:54:20,601 --> 00:54:23,646
- Somebody's messing around.
- I am not.

440
00:54:24,563 --> 00:54:26,774
I don't care
how much a man admires you.

441
00:54:26,982 --> 00:54:30,903
He's not giving you earrings like that
unless you've given him booty.

442
00:54:31,111 --> 00:54:36,951
- Not everybody thinks like you.
- They do, but they don't admit it.

443
00:54:54,343 --> 00:54:58,305
Do you realise I have not had sex
since we got to America?

444
00:54:58,514 --> 00:55:01,433
Semmi, look. There she is.

445
00:55:02,476 --> 00:55:04,937
- I'm going to talk to her.
- Good.

446
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:07,731
Tell her you sent her the 500,000 dollar
pair of earrings.

447
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:12,111
She will fall into your arms, and we
can leave this god-forsaken place.

448
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,154
- I cannot do that.
- Do something.

449
00:55:14,363 --> 00:55:19,076
- Do not worry, I have a plan.
- To mop your way into her heart?

450
00:55:19,285 --> 00:55:22,788
- That's not fair.
- Nor is me doing manual labour.

451
00:55:24,665 --> 00:55:27,960
- I'm badly in need of a manicure.
- Listen to you...

452
00:55:28,168 --> 00:55:31,130
"I'm badly in need of a manicure."

453
00:55:31,338 --> 00:55:34,592
Are you going to say something?

454
00:55:38,304 --> 00:55:43,017
- Hey, Akeem! This is my sister, Patrice.
- Hello, how are you?

455
00:55:43,225 --> 00:55:47,062
- Akeem's from Africa.
- What are you doing in New York?

456
00:55:47,271 --> 00:55:50,649
- I'm a student.
- What school are you going to?

457
00:55:50,858 --> 00:55:53,694
I go to the University.

458
00:55:53,903 --> 00:55:55,487
Which one?

459
00:55:57,615 --> 00:56:00,409
The University of the United States.

460
00:56:02,161 --> 00:56:04,371
I've never heard of that.

461
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:08,125
It's a very small university.
We don't even have a basketball team.

462
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:13,756
Really? We've got an extra ticket
for the St. John's game. Want to come?

463
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:16,842
Yes.

464
00:56:17,051 --> 00:56:20,596
You can double -date
with me and Darryl

465
00:56:46,497 --> 00:56:48,791
In his face! In his face!

466
00:56:48,999 --> 00:56:51,752
Yes! In the face!

467
00:56:55,256 --> 00:56:58,342
Why don't you take off yourjacket,
Akeem?

468
00:56:58,550 --> 00:57:02,054
"Put it in the face," right? I like this.

469
00:57:03,097 --> 00:57:06,308
- Isn't that better?
- Yes, thank you very much.

470
00:57:14,024 --> 00:57:17,695
Wearing clothes must be
a new experience for you.

471
00:57:17,903 --> 00:57:21,949
- Are you able to follow the game?
- Oh, yes!

472
00:57:22,157 --> 00:57:25,411
I'm following the game quite well.

473
00:57:27,246 --> 00:57:31,208
What kind of games do you play
in Africa? Chase the monkey?

474
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:36,005
No, we play football.
I believe you call it soccer.

475
00:57:36,213 --> 00:57:38,090
Yeah, right. Soccer.

476
00:57:38,299 --> 00:57:44,221
That's a real cute sport. Especially the
way you bounce the ball off your heads.

477
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:48,392
I don't like any sport
where you don't use your hands.

478
00:57:49,560 --> 00:57:51,979
Yes! Yes!

479
00:57:52,187 --> 00:57:56,108
What are you doing?
It's just the half -time?

480
00:57:57,151 --> 00:58:01,238
This is my favourite part of the game.
Will you excuse me for a moment?

481
00:58:01,447 --> 00:58:05,034
Excuse me. I'll be back in a minute.

482
00:58:19,506 --> 00:58:22,843
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness, it is you!

483
00:58:23,928 --> 00:58:26,263
I cannot believe it.

484
00:58:29,308 --> 00:58:33,228
- Greetings, your Highness.
- Please, stop bowing.

485
00:58:33,437 --> 00:58:37,608
- I am a loyal citizen of Zamunda.
- You will spill your beverages.

486
00:58:38,734 --> 00:58:41,904
This is the greatest day of my life.

487
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:46,867
It was very nice meeting you, too.
Excuse me.

488
00:58:50,454 --> 00:58:55,125
Please! Please, may I just have
my picture taken with you?

489
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:12,101
I will cherish this experience
for the rest of my life.

490
00:59:18,065 --> 00:59:20,943
For the rest of my life.

491
00:59:23,404 --> 00:59:27,825
- Who was that?
- Just a man I met in the restroom.

492
00:59:35,499 --> 00:59:39,837
- Why don't you quit this job?
- Because I like it here.

493
00:59:40,045 --> 00:59:43,841
But you're my lady.
My lady doesn't have to work.

494
00:59:45,175 --> 00:59:48,721
I'll take care of you.
Get you anything you want.

495
00:59:49,972 --> 00:59:52,891
- What can I get you?
- Nothing.

496
00:59:54,852 --> 00:59:57,980
I'll get you some... coffee.

497
00:59:59,356 --> 01:00:02,109
I'll be right back.

498
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:12,036
Hey, Akeem. Did you have
a good time at the game?

499
01:00:12,244 --> 01:00:13,662
Yes, I did.

500
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:17,458
I hope Darryl didn't offend you.
He can be pretty obnoxious.

501
01:00:17,666 --> 01:00:21,712
- He cannot help it.
- Sit down, take a break for a minute.

502
01:00:25,424 --> 01:00:27,885
You're an unusual guy.

503
01:00:28,093 --> 01:00:31,221
I've never seen anybody take
so much pride in mopping a floor.

504
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:35,517
"He who would learn to fly
must first learn to stand and walk."

505
01:00:35,726 --> 01:00:40,606
"One cannot fly into flying."
That's not mine, that's Nietzsche's.

506
01:00:40,814 --> 01:00:44,652
That's what I mean. The guys
that work here don't quote Nietzsche.

507
01:00:49,782 --> 01:00:53,118
Everybody shut up and do what I say.

508
01:00:53,327 --> 01:00:57,831
Get the money out!
Stay cool, nobody gets hurt.

509
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,501
Take the money out! All of it.

510
01:01:00,709 --> 01:01:03,796
Don't stall me, fat boy. Let's go.

511
01:01:04,004 --> 01:01:07,591
Come on! You're wasting my time.
Come on!

512
01:01:11,053 --> 01:01:14,056
Ahybody move,
I'll blow your fucking head off.

513
01:01:14,265 --> 01:01:17,518
What are you looking at, buddy?

514
01:01:19,395 --> 01:01:23,065
Come on! Stop stalling.

515
01:01:25,568 --> 01:01:29,738
Come on. Don't stall me. All of it!

516
01:01:34,827 --> 01:01:38,622
- Come on!
- Excuse me for a moment.

517
01:01:44,837 --> 01:01:46,797
It would be wise for you
to put the weapon down.

518
01:01:47,006 --> 01:01:49,216
Who is this asshole?

519
01:01:50,843 --> 01:01:55,556
Please refrain from using any more
obscenities in front of these people.

520
01:01:55,764 --> 01:01:58,434
I've warned you.
I'll be forced to thrash you.

521
01:01:58,642 --> 01:02:00,644
Fuck you!

522
01:02:05,941 --> 01:02:09,570
Freeze,
you diseased rhinoceros' pizzle.

523
01:02:21,874 --> 01:02:26,587
Hey, fellas. I'm real proud of the job
you did in there today.

524
01:02:26,795 --> 01:02:29,340
We've been hit by that guy five times,

525
01:02:29,548 --> 01:02:34,511
but I don't think he's coming back,
thanks to my African connections.

526
01:02:36,263 --> 01:02:41,852
Leave Sunday night open.
I'm having a get-together at my house.

527
01:02:43,562 --> 01:02:45,689
You see?
He has accepted us as equals.

528
01:02:48,525 --> 01:02:53,322
OK, fellas. Give them a ticket, take their
keys and park the cars down the street.

529
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:56,367
When you're finished, come inside
and help out in the kitchen.

530
01:02:56,575 --> 01:03:02,414
Akeem, I want to show you
the inside of McDowell's little castle.

531
01:03:07,211 --> 01:03:12,383
This here is my showplace.
It pretty much speaks for itself.

532
01:03:13,634 --> 01:03:20,266
When I grew up, nine of us lived
in a shack no bigger than this room.

533
01:03:20,975 --> 01:03:24,144
And look what I have today.

534
01:03:24,353 --> 01:03:27,606
I only wish Mrs McDowell
could have lived to see it.

535
01:03:27,815 --> 01:03:31,652
- You have a fine house, sir.
- Thank you.

536
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:37,366
In 20 or 30 years, with hard work,
maybe you could have a place like this.

537
01:03:40,953 --> 01:03:43,539
- That would be something.
- Wouldn't it?

538
01:03:47,501 --> 01:03:51,130
This is where you're going
to be working tonight.

539
01:03:59,722 --> 01:04:04,518
- Ever open a champagne bottle?
- I have seen it done before.

540
01:04:04,727 --> 01:04:07,521
Make sure you keep all the glasses full.

541
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:12,151
I'd better get dressed. Make yourself
comfortable 'til the guests arrive.

542
01:04:15,321 --> 01:04:20,993
I love the Lord. Do you understand
what I'm saying? I love the Lord.

543
01:04:21,201 --> 01:04:25,164
And if loving the Lord is wrong,
I don't want to be right.

544
01:04:25,372 --> 01:04:30,961
Hi, Mike. Good to see you. Enjoy, drink
up. Lots more where that came from.

545
01:04:31,211 --> 01:04:35,382
Hey, Randy! Good to see you.
Watch out for this guy.

546
01:04:35,591 --> 01:04:37,384
Big Ed, my man!

547
01:04:38,427 --> 01:04:42,848
You know, I can appreciate the way
you handled that dude with the gun.

548
01:04:43,474 --> 01:04:46,352
I would've helped you out, except...

549
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:49,605
I had a cup of coffee in my hand.
You understand, right?

550
01:04:49,813 --> 01:04:55,527
I bet you learnt all that stuff
fighting lions and tigers and shit.

551
01:04:55,736 --> 01:04:59,365
Yes, where I'm from,
we have to be very aggressive.

552
01:04:59,573 --> 01:05:03,244
I'm all for that. Especially with women.

553
01:05:04,036 --> 01:05:06,830
They may not admit it...

554
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,794
...but they all want
a man to take charge.

555
01:05:16,507 --> 01:05:19,593
Tell them what to do.

556
01:05:27,434 --> 01:05:29,645
That's one of the things
I want to talk to you...

557
01:05:29,853 --> 01:05:34,358
Darryl, your mother gets lovelier
every time I see her.

558
01:05:34,567 --> 01:05:39,530
- Cleo, I'd like to talk to you alone.
- Sure. Excuse us.

559
01:05:39,738 --> 01:05:43,033
- Mum, Dad, Grandma...
- Sure, son.

560
01:05:43,242 --> 01:05:47,580
I like the fries better at McDonald's,
but I'd never tell Mr McDowell that.

561
01:05:49,707 --> 01:05:52,710
Make sure everybody's glass
is kept full.

562
01:05:52,918 --> 01:05:56,672
We're about to make
a very special announcement.

563
01:06:01,218 --> 01:06:04,513
May I have
everyone's attention, please.

564
01:06:08,225 --> 01:06:13,564
Mr and Mrs Jenks, would you join me?
Mother Jenks, you come up here, too.

565
01:06:22,990 --> 01:06:26,452
I've just heard some news
that makes me a very happy man.

566
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:28,203
Semmi, please...

567
01:06:30,748 --> 01:06:33,083
Champagne.

568
01:06:34,251 --> 01:06:37,171
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

569
01:06:37,379 --> 01:06:40,841
Okay, get going. Get out of here. Go on.

570
01:06:42,968 --> 01:06:48,724
As you know, Darryl and Lisa have
been going together for quite some time.

571
01:06:48,933 --> 01:06:54,104
I'm pleased to announce
that Darryl just popped the big question.

572
01:06:56,357 --> 01:06:59,652
And Lisa happily accepted.

573
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:10,579
So as it turns out, this has become
an engagement party.

574
01:07:11,372 --> 01:07:14,959
Amen! Praise the Lord.

575
01:07:15,167 --> 01:07:19,338
- Married?
- To the bride and groom.

576
01:07:19,546 --> 01:07:21,548
To the bride and groom!

577
01:07:21,757 --> 01:07:23,884
To the bride and groom.

578
01:07:31,392 --> 01:07:35,562
I want you and that young man
to tie that knot. I'll pray for you.

579
01:07:35,771 --> 01:07:38,732
And I want you to hold on
to God's unchanging hand.

580
01:07:38,941 --> 01:07:42,611
'Cause he helped Joshua
fight the battle of Jericho.

581
01:07:43,862 --> 01:07:46,740
And he helped Daniel
get out of the lion's den.

582
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:51,120
He helped Gilligan get off the island.
Lord!

583
01:07:51,328 --> 01:07:54,373
I want to talk to you, now!

584
01:08:04,466 --> 01:08:09,513
The next time you and my father
plan my life, let me in on it.

585
01:08:09,722 --> 01:08:12,099
- It's not like...
- Don't touch me!

586
01:08:12,308 --> 01:08:15,603
But baby, it's our engagement party.

587
01:08:26,822 --> 01:08:28,782
Thanks.

588
01:08:35,956 --> 01:08:41,503
- Would you like some champagne?
- No, I don't feel like celebrating.

589
01:08:44,006 --> 01:08:48,594
Wait. Sit down and keep me company.

590
01:08:57,478 --> 01:09:01,148
If you're going to hang out with me,
you've got to loosen up.

591
01:09:01,357 --> 01:09:04,193
I can be loose. See?

592
01:09:05,527 --> 01:09:07,529
Much better.

593
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:12,159
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

594
01:09:12,368 --> 01:09:17,206
But I won't be pressured into marriage,
not by Darryl, my father or anybody.

595
01:09:18,165 --> 01:09:21,710
I understand.
In my country they arrange marriages,

596
01:09:21,919 --> 01:09:24,630
but no one should marry
out of obligation.

597
01:09:24,838 --> 01:09:30,469
You're right. How could I even have
considered marrying a guy like Darryl

598
01:09:30,678 --> 01:09:36,308
- I wondered the same thing.
- He made me so furious back there.

599
01:09:36,517 --> 01:09:41,522
- Do you think I overreacted?
- The first reaction is often correct.

600
01:09:43,190 --> 01:09:47,695
You're very easy to talk to.
I feel like I could tell you anything.

601
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:58,122
Hey, Akeem. We need
some more champagne over here.

602
01:09:59,915 --> 01:10:03,127
I almost forgot that I was here
in a domestic capacity.

603
01:10:03,335 --> 01:10:07,715
Thanks for listening to me, Akeem.
I really appreciate it.

604
01:10:07,923 --> 01:10:11,093
Ahy time, Lisa McDowell.

605
01:10:15,931 --> 01:10:18,517
Hey! Be careful

606
01:10:19,768 --> 01:10:23,105
I think my sister likes you.

607
01:10:30,446 --> 01:10:32,448
Semmi!

608
01:10:35,075 --> 01:10:37,119
Semmi.

609
01:10:41,832 --> 01:10:48,172
- Come, you're going to be late for work.
- So what if I am?

610
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:53,177
We cannot anger Mr McDowell.
Things are going so well with Lisa.

611
01:10:53,385 --> 01:10:57,264
I do not care.
I'm not going to work today.

612
01:10:57,514 --> 01:11:00,601
Yes, you are going to work today.

613
01:11:01,644 --> 01:11:04,188
I'm sick of living like a peasant.
Look at this filth.

614
01:11:04,396 --> 01:11:08,859
Do you want to live better? Fine.
Fix this place up.

615
01:11:09,068 --> 01:11:11,737
But you are going to work today!

616
01:11:21,622 --> 01:11:23,791
- Hello!
- Hi!

617
01:11:23,999 --> 01:11:27,711
I started on clean-up just like you guys,
but now...

618
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:33,092
See, I'm washing lettuce.
Soon, I'll be on fries. Then the grill.

619
01:11:33,926 --> 01:11:36,971
In a year or two,
I'll make assistant manager

620
01:11:37,179 --> 01:11:40,474
and that's where the big bucks
start rolling in.

621
01:11:40,683 --> 01:11:43,519
Just two years, huh?

622
01:11:47,231 --> 01:11:52,611
Maybe I've stayed with him
because everyone expected me to.

623
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:56,740
- You must be tired of my problems.
- No, not at all.

624
01:11:58,033 --> 01:12:00,786
I feel like I owe you a favour.

625
01:12:00,995 --> 01:12:05,916
Come to my house and I'll fix
you dinner. Patrice will be there.

626
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:10,504
Let's go to my house.
I'd like to cook for you.

627
01:12:10,713 --> 01:12:14,341
- You cook?
- I dabble a little, yes.

628
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:17,469
Great! Tell you what,
I'll buy the groceries.

629
01:12:17,678 --> 01:12:23,017
Fine. But I have to warn you.
My home is very poor.

630
01:12:23,225 --> 01:12:27,521
I don't care about that.
I'd love to see where you live.

631
01:12:41,076 --> 01:12:44,079
Welcome to my humble abode.

632
01:12:52,796 --> 01:12:56,592
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

633
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:01,096
Everything's fine.
Excuse me for a moment, please.

634
01:13:05,351 --> 01:13:08,979
- What have you done?
- You told me to fix up the place.

635
01:13:10,940 --> 01:13:14,818
I should kill you!
I'm supposed to be a poor man.

636
01:13:15,027 --> 01:13:18,030
Akeem? Akeem.

637
01:13:20,866 --> 01:13:23,077
- Is everything all right?
- Everything is fine.

638
01:13:23,285 --> 01:13:26,038
Excuse me, I have to tidy up.

639
01:13:42,221 --> 01:13:44,890
What are you doing?

640
01:13:47,017 --> 01:13:50,604
For God's sake,
do not take my pocket money.

641
01:13:55,276 --> 01:13:58,445
If you have no more money,
you can cause no more mischief.

642
01:13:58,654 --> 01:14:01,407
You are being unreasonable.

643
01:14:01,615 --> 01:14:07,538
If you have ruined my chances
with Lisa, I will never forgive you.

644
01:14:10,874 --> 01:14:13,377
- I'm very sorry.
- Can we go in now?

645
01:14:13,586 --> 01:14:16,630
- No, we cannot.
- Why not?

646
01:14:16,839 --> 01:14:20,259
There's a big rat inside.

647
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:23,178
I think there is no rat.

648
01:14:23,387 --> 01:14:28,851
You're so ashamed of your apartment
you can't even let me see it.

649
01:14:29,059 --> 01:14:32,396
Once again, you have judged correctly.

650
01:14:32,605 --> 01:14:37,401
- If it bothers you, we can go out to eat.
- That would be much better.

651
01:15:03,218 --> 01:15:05,888
Excuse me for a moment, please.

652
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:20,194
- What did you give him?
- I just gave him some pocket change.

653
01:15:34,875 --> 01:15:38,087
- Randolph...
- Leave me alone, Mortimer.

654
01:15:38,295 --> 01:15:41,257
Randolph! Randolph!

655
01:15:42,967 --> 01:15:47,012
- I'm still not talking to you.
- Look!

656
01:15:53,978 --> 01:15:57,356
Mortimer, we're back.

657
01:15:57,565 --> 01:16:00,276
Yeah!

658
01:16:00,985 --> 01:16:03,362
To America!

659
01:16:07,533 --> 01:16:09,660
Why did you come here?

660
01:16:09,868 --> 01:16:13,372
- To find something special
- it's a long way to travel

661
01:16:13,581 --> 01:16:18,335
No journey is too great,
when one finds what he seeks.

662
01:16:18,544 --> 01:16:22,965
- Does everyone in Africa talk like you?
- Why, do you not like it?

663
01:16:23,173 --> 01:16:28,887
I love it. It's nice to be with a man
who knows how to express himself.

664
01:16:29,930 --> 01:16:31,849
- Thank you!
- Thank you very much!

665
01:16:32,057 --> 01:16:34,476
Let's have lunch.

666
01:16:37,813 --> 01:16:41,150
You have the most amazing effect
on people.

667
01:16:41,358 --> 01:16:46,322
- No, I don'.
- Take the guy at the basketball game.

668
01:16:46,530 --> 01:16:49,158
People love you.

669
01:16:50,117 --> 01:16:54,788
I bet where you're from,
women throw themselves at your feet.

670
01:16:54,997 --> 01:17:00,502
- Why do you say that?
- You have an inner glow.

671
01:17:00,711 --> 01:17:04,840
You're above anything petty.
It's almost regal

672
01:17:08,844 --> 01:17:15,517
- What did you do back home?
- I was... in the family business.

673
01:17:16,393 --> 01:17:20,272
- What's that?
- Goat herding.

674
01:17:21,273 --> 01:17:24,360
Yes, yes. Does it surprise you?

675
01:17:24,568 --> 01:17:27,738
No, it's just that you seem so educated.

676
01:17:27,947 --> 01:17:33,118
The life of a goat herder is easy,
the goats take care of themselves.

677
01:17:33,327 --> 01:17:37,456
Which leaves a man
with a great deal of time to read.

678
01:17:40,292 --> 01:17:44,004
- Please, let me.
- No, I should pay.

679
01:17:44,213 --> 01:17:47,800
Akeem, I wish you'd stop
worrying about being poor.

680
01:17:48,008 --> 01:17:51,804
If I wanted a wealthy guy,
I'd be with Darryl

681
01:17:52,012 --> 01:17:54,348
Not you.

682
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:03,566
- Would you like to dance?
- Yes.

683
01:18:31,802 --> 01:18:34,763
What about Patrice?

684
01:18:34,972 --> 01:18:38,475
I'm not interested in Patrice.

685
01:18:39,852 --> 01:18:42,479
What about Darryl

686
01:18:42,688 --> 01:18:46,066
I'm not interested in Darryl, either.

687
01:19:11,717 --> 01:19:16,055
- Do you actually want to send this?
- Why? What is wrong?

688
01:19:16,263 --> 01:19:17,890
Read it to me.

689
01:19:18,098 --> 01:19:23,812
"To his Majesty King Jaffe Joffer,
the Royal Palace, Zamunda."

690
01:19:24,021 --> 01:19:28,150
"Sire, Akeem and I
have depleted our funds."

691
01:19:28,359 --> 01:19:32,321
"Kindly send 300,000 American dollars
immediately,"

692
01:19:32,529 --> 01:19:36,909
"as we are in dire straits.
Your humble servant, Semmi."

693
01:19:37,117 --> 01:19:39,495
Semmi.

694
01:19:39,703 --> 01:19:44,458
- Should I make it 400,000?
- Do you think that'll be enough?

695
01:19:44,667 --> 01:19:47,336
You are right. 500,000.

696
01:19:48,212 --> 01:19:51,548
As long as you're asking,
why not go for a cool million?

697
01:19:51,757 --> 01:19:56,053
- Don't you think that's too much?
- Nah.

698
01:20:02,434 --> 01:20:05,020
Okay, what's going on?

699
01:20:05,229 --> 01:20:07,690
Patrice...

700
01:20:09,692 --> 01:20:11,986
I came to see Akeem.

701
01:20:12,194 --> 01:20:16,448
What are you involved in?
You can't afford this on your salary.

702
01:20:19,368 --> 01:20:23,831
Someone to kiss
Someone to miss

703
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:28,043
When you're away
Through here, gone each day

704
01:20:28,252 --> 01:20:33,424
To be loved, to be loved
Wow! What a feeling

705
01:20:33,632 --> 01:20:38,971
- Qu¡et! People are try¡ng to sleep.
- Some w¡sh to be a k¡ng or a queen

706
01:20:39,179 --> 01:20:42,182
- Some w¡sh for fortune and fame
- Shut up!

707
01:20:42,391 --> 01:20:47,271
But to be truly, truly, truly, truly loved

708
01:20:47,479 --> 01:20:51,150
it must mean all of these things

709
01:20:53,027 --> 01:20:57,072
Someone to care
Someone to share

710
01:20:57,281 --> 01:21:01,911
Lonely hours and moments of despair

711
01:21:02,119 --> 01:21:08,000
To be loved, to be loved
Wow! What a feeling

712
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:12,755
Semmi, I just had the most wonderful...

713
01:21:14,214 --> 01:21:18,677
Hi, Akeem. Semmi told me everything.

714
01:21:20,012 --> 01:21:24,850
Sorry things didn't work out between
you and me, but you understand.

715
01:21:25,059 --> 01:21:28,687
Goodnight, sweet prince.

716
01:21:35,819 --> 01:21:38,781
Remember, you must not tell a soul

717
01:21:38,989 --> 01:21:44,203
Your secret is safe with me,
your Highness. Bye...

718
01:21:52,086 --> 01:21:55,130
If you're the prince, then who am I

719
01:21:58,175 --> 01:22:00,678
My servant.

720
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:16,986
They smell good. Darryl must be
spending a fortune on flowers.

721
01:22:17,194 --> 01:22:19,863
Stay out of this, Dad.

722
01:22:20,072 --> 01:22:23,951
- Where are you going?
- To a museum. With Akeem.

723
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:28,289
- I don't like that one bit.
- What's wrong with Akeem?

724
01:22:29,373 --> 01:22:32,334
You told me yourself.
He's a goat herder.

725
01:22:33,627 --> 01:22:38,632
Why don't you marry Darryl
He dresses nice, he treats you good.

726
01:22:38,841 --> 01:22:42,219
You only like Darryl because he's rich.

727
01:22:43,554 --> 01:22:47,850
I don't want you to have to struggle
like your mother and I did.

728
01:22:48,058 --> 01:22:51,478
I know. Bye, Daddy.

729
01:22:58,485 --> 01:23:00,696
Come in.

730
01:23:02,948 --> 01:23:07,745
- You boys wanted to see me.
- We would like to change apartments.

731
01:23:09,496 --> 01:23:12,291
Goddamn! What the hell
have you done in here?

732
01:23:12,499 --> 01:23:17,046
My friend Semmi has altered the
apartment, so we would like to change.

733
01:23:17,254 --> 01:23:18,923
This stuff ain't hot, is it?

734
01:23:19,131 --> 01:23:25,220
No, but I'm bringing a young lady up,
and she can't see me living like this.

735
01:23:26,847 --> 01:23:32,937
I'll let you boys stay in my apartment
and I'll move up here.

736
01:23:33,145 --> 01:23:38,484
- Does your apartment look poor?
- It's a real shithole. You'll love it.

737
01:23:39,777 --> 01:23:45,366
Here are the keys. It's apartment 1 A.
Downstairs. First floor.

738
01:23:45,574 --> 01:23:49,411
Thank you, you're too kind.
Semmi, move our things.

739
01:23:57,461 --> 01:24:00,756
I have a date with Lisa.
Isn't that wonderful

740
01:25:19,627 --> 01:25:22,922
Who in the hell is that?

741
01:25:33,182 --> 01:25:39,313
What's up, brother? You're a little late
for the Christmas pageant.

742
01:25:43,275 --> 01:25:46,195
I'm King Jaffe Joffer, ruler of Zamunda.

743
01:25:46,403 --> 01:25:50,532
Have a seat. Chair number two
will be ready in a second.

744
01:25:53,869 --> 01:25:56,747
This is beautiful What is that - velvet?

745
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:01,126
I have come for my son Akeem.

746
01:26:01,335 --> 01:26:06,173
- Who?
- You know, Kunta.

747
01:26:06,382 --> 01:26:12,596
- The boy upstairs.
- He live upstairs on the fifth floor.

748
01:26:15,015 --> 01:26:18,102
Who's going to clean up the flowers?

749
01:26:27,528 --> 01:26:30,155
You may enter.

750
01:26:36,954 --> 01:26:40,833
- You are not Akeem.
- I know that.

751
01:26:49,383 --> 01:26:52,761
- What is this?
- A photograph.

752
01:26:52,970 --> 01:26:55,055
What is this "McDowell's"?

753
01:26:55,264 --> 01:27:00,436
It's a place over on Queens Boulevard.
I think he works there.

754
01:27:00,644 --> 01:27:03,564
My son works?!

755
01:27:03,772 --> 01:27:09,361
- Where is he now?
- He moved to apartment 1 A.

756
01:27:20,581 --> 01:27:24,001
Your Majesty.
What are you doing here?

757
01:27:24,209 --> 01:27:27,296
I received your telegram.
Where is Akeem?

758
01:27:28,714 --> 01:27:32,593
He went out. How was your flight?
Comfortable, I trust.

759
01:27:32,801 --> 01:27:37,765
Yourjob was to look after Akeem.
How could you let this happen?

760
01:27:37,973 --> 01:27:41,602
Akeem will not listen to me,
he's gone quite mad.

761
01:27:43,229 --> 01:27:45,064
Semmi...

762
01:27:45,272 --> 01:27:50,027
You've disgraced yourself,
and you must be punished.

763
01:27:50,986 --> 01:27:56,158
You will confine yourself to our
royal suite at the Waldorf-Astoria.

764
01:27:56,367 --> 01:28:01,497
See that he puts on some decent attire.
And bathe him thoroughly.

765
01:28:07,294 --> 01:28:09,713
Thank you, your Majesty!

766
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,970
Look, Zamunda!
That's where you're from, isn't it?

767
01:28:16,178 --> 01:28:19,848
- What's it like?
- It's the most beautiful place on earth.

768
01:28:20,057 --> 01:28:26,355
The people are very friendly, and you...
You, they would treat like a queen.

769
01:28:31,986 --> 01:28:34,822
People will see us.

770
01:28:35,447 --> 01:28:38,158
Then let them see. Lisa...

771
01:28:38,367 --> 01:28:40,452
- Let us go.
- Now?

772
01:28:40,661 --> 01:28:43,497
Yes. Right now.

773
01:28:59,513 --> 01:29:05,311
Darryl, come by the house tonight.
About 9 p.m.

774
01:29:06,186 --> 01:29:08,814
Lisa will be home by then.

775
01:29:09,023 --> 01:29:12,318
Don't worry about it,
we'll work something out.

776
01:29:12,526 --> 01:29:15,112
Okay, see you later.

777
01:29:20,826 --> 01:29:25,205
There's some people here to see you.

778
01:29:26,999 --> 01:29:30,336
- Are they from McDonald's?
- I don't think so.

779
01:29:37,384 --> 01:29:40,012
What can I do for you?

780
01:29:43,057 --> 01:29:45,643
This is King Jaffe Joffer,
ruler of Zamunda.

781
01:29:45,851 --> 01:29:50,147
- He's searching for his son Akeem.
- Your son?

782
01:29:50,356 --> 01:29:54,401
- Yes, my son, the Prince.
- Prince? Are you serious?

783
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:57,446
Prince Akeem is the sole heir
to the throne of Zamunda.

784
01:29:57,655 --> 01:30:00,783
I knew there was something special
about that boy.

785
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:05,996
- Can you tell us where he might be?
- He's out with my lovely daughter Lisa.

786
01:30:08,540 --> 01:30:11,919
I'm staying at the Waldorf-Astoria.
When you see him, call me.

787
01:30:12,127 --> 01:30:14,380
- I'll tell him you're here.
- No.

788
01:30:14,588 --> 01:30:19,301
Do not alert him to my presence.
I shall deal with him myself.

789
01:30:25,182 --> 01:30:30,187
- For your trouble.
- Thank you, your Royalness.

790
01:30:40,698 --> 01:30:42,241
A prince!

791
01:31:04,597 --> 01:31:07,391
Wait! We cannot go in.

792
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,518
Why not?

793
01:31:09,727 --> 01:31:12,813
Wait in the car. I will be right back.

794
01:31:22,948 --> 01:31:25,284
- We must leave.
- I don't care about the apartment.

795
01:31:25,492 --> 01:31:28,203
It's not that. I feel like I'm rushing you.

796
01:31:28,412 --> 01:31:30,497
No, you're not.

797
01:31:31,373 --> 01:31:35,044
- It's better if we take our time.
- But I want to.

798
01:31:35,252 --> 01:31:38,172
It's better if I take you home.

799
01:31:44,553 --> 01:31:49,391
Look who's here!
Akeem, it's good to see you.

800
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:52,519
- It's good to see you, too.
- Have a drink.

801
01:31:52,728 --> 01:31:57,316
- I have to get going, Mr McDowell.
- You have time for one drink.

802
01:31:57,524 --> 01:31:59,193
Get out of here, dog.

803
01:31:59,401 --> 01:32:01,654
We don't spend enough time talking.

804
01:32:01,862 --> 01:32:04,448
Perhaps some other time,
I have to get going.

805
01:32:04,657 --> 01:32:08,202
Sit down,
I'll be right back with that drink.

806
01:32:25,719 --> 01:32:28,639
King Jaffe Joffer's room, please.

807
01:32:30,808 --> 01:32:33,727
Hello, King. Cleo McDowell here.

808
01:32:33,936 --> 01:32:37,106
Both the kids are here, together.

809
01:32:37,314 --> 01:32:43,070
2432 Derby Avenue,
Jamaica Estates. Right.

810
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:46,991
King, I was wondering if... Hello, King?

811
01:32:50,619 --> 01:32:53,914
- I really have to go, sir.
- No. Have a seat right here.

812
01:32:54,123 --> 01:32:56,625
Did you want ice in that?

813
01:32:56,834 --> 01:32:59,253
Excuse me, I'll be right back.

814
01:33:10,848 --> 01:33:13,976
- Who was that?
- Jehovah's Witness.

815
01:33:15,394 --> 01:33:17,146
Excuse me.

816
01:33:23,402 --> 01:33:27,239
She doesn't like you anymore.
Get that through your greasy head!

817
01:33:27,448 --> 01:33:30,117
But you told me to come over.

818
01:33:32,828 --> 01:33:34,788
Now, where were we?

819
01:33:50,304 --> 01:33:53,015
I warned you, didn't I? Dottie, get him!

820
01:34:02,900 --> 01:34:05,819
I appreciate your hospitality,
but I have to get going.

821
01:34:06,028 --> 01:34:07,988
You can stay a little while longer.

822
01:34:08,197 --> 01:34:12,201
I just put some delicious hors d'oeuvres
in the oven... son.

823
01:34:13,285 --> 01:34:15,537
Let me go see if they're ready.

824
01:34:19,083 --> 01:34:22,127
- Lisa, I must leave.
- Is something wrong, Akeem?

825
01:34:23,212 --> 01:34:25,798
I'll tell you when the time is right,
but now I must go.

826
01:34:26,006 --> 01:34:29,009
Tell your father goodbye for me.

827
01:34:32,555 --> 01:34:34,848
- Where's Akeem?
- He had to leave.

828
01:34:35,057 --> 01:34:38,978
- He can't leave!
- What is going on?

829
01:34:39,186 --> 01:34:42,690
And why are you so nice to Akeem
all of a sudden?

830
01:34:42,898 --> 01:34:45,401
I like the boy.

831
01:34:45,609 --> 01:34:48,821
- What are you up to?
- What? Nothing.

832
01:34:49,029 --> 01:34:51,490
A man's got a right
to change his mind.

833
01:34:51,699 --> 01:34:56,036
- Daddy...
- You two make a beautiful couple.

834
01:34:56,245 --> 01:34:59,873
- Daddy...
- He's a real fine young man.

835
01:35:00,082 --> 01:35:06,213
- Dad!
- Okay, Lisa. He's rich. He is rich!

836
01:35:06,422 --> 01:35:09,049
- What?
- He's got his own money.

837
01:35:09,258 --> 01:35:15,055
When I tell you he's got his own money,
I mean the boy has got his own money.

838
01:35:22,438 --> 01:35:25,608
A prince. He's a prince!

839
01:35:28,110 --> 01:35:31,447
Lisa, you did it this time.
You hit the jackpot!

840
01:35:31,655 --> 01:35:35,492
Your goat herder makes Darryl
look like a welfare case.

841
01:35:49,214 --> 01:35:51,675
I will get out here.

842
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:55,930
That'll be nine bucks.

843
01:36:17,952 --> 01:36:21,038
Good news, Akeem.
We've been rescued.

844
01:36:21,247 --> 01:36:26,210
- Where are my parents?
- They've gone to the McDowell's.

845
01:36:26,418 --> 01:36:28,545
- Come with me.
- Where are we going?

846
01:36:28,754 --> 01:36:30,673
Back to Queens.

847
01:36:32,049 --> 01:36:35,511
Look who's here! Come in, come in.

848
01:36:35,719 --> 01:36:38,514
Welcome to Casa de McDowell's.
Come right in.

849
01:36:48,524 --> 01:36:51,402
- Where is Akeem?
- He just stepped out.

850
01:36:51,610 --> 01:36:55,698
Probably went for a pizza.
You know these youngsters.

851
01:36:55,906 --> 01:36:59,618
This must be your lovely wife.
How are you today?

852
01:36:59,827 --> 01:37:01,787
Very well, thank you.

853
01:37:01,996 --> 01:37:06,792
I don't know whether to shake
your hand, kiss it or bow or what.

854
01:37:07,001 --> 01:37:10,212
I feel like break dancing.

855
01:37:10,421 --> 01:37:16,260
Come in, have a seat, take a load off.
Your son ought to be back in a minute.

856
01:37:16,468 --> 01:37:20,180
- Try the Lazy-Boy. It's comfortable.
- It's very nice.

857
01:37:20,389 --> 01:37:22,182
Put your feet up.

858
01:37:29,857 --> 01:37:32,568
Here you go, King.
Try one of these pigs in a blanket.

859
01:37:32,776 --> 01:37:34,987
They're the frozen kind,
but you'd never know it.

860
01:37:35,195 --> 01:37:38,032
You told me my son was here.

861
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:42,870
My daughter Lisa might know where
he went. They've gotten quite close.

862
01:37:43,078 --> 01:37:46,040
Where is your daughter?
I must speak to her at once.

863
01:37:46,624 --> 01:37:49,460
Lisa?
There's someone here to see you.

864
01:37:55,674 --> 01:37:59,094
This is Akeem's father. The King!

865
01:37:59,303 --> 01:38:01,347
Leave us.

866
01:38:10,397 --> 01:38:14,068
- I understand you're seeing my son.
- I was seeing him.

867
01:38:14,276 --> 01:38:16,320
So you know about his wife
in Zamunda?

868
01:38:16,528 --> 01:38:18,989
- He's married?
- No, but he will be soon.

869
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:23,118
We've already chosen his bride.
So you see...

870
01:38:23,327 --> 01:38:25,871
...he cannot be serious about you.

871
01:38:26,080 --> 01:38:30,376
Akeem came to America to...
sow his royal oats.

872
01:38:31,835 --> 01:38:34,255
Excuse me, I need to be alone.

873
01:38:34,463 --> 01:38:38,801
Are you comfortable, Miss...
I'm not sure what to call you.

874
01:38:39,009 --> 01:38:44,181
- My name is Cleo.
- Nice to meet you. My name's Aoleon.

875
01:38:44,390 --> 01:38:47,059
Aoleon. Aeolon...

876
01:38:50,563 --> 01:38:55,901
Lisa, where are you going?
I want you to meet the Queen.

877
01:38:56,110 --> 01:39:02,116
- Are you all right, my dear?
- I'm sorry. I have to get out of here.

878
01:39:02,324 --> 01:39:04,952
What's the matter, baby?

879
01:39:10,165 --> 01:39:12,334
What did you say to my daughter?

880
01:39:12,543 --> 01:39:16,255
The truth. That Akeem
could not be interested in her.

881
01:39:16,463 --> 01:39:21,427
- How can you be so sure?
- Our son can't consort with such a girl

882
01:39:21,635 --> 01:39:24,138
Now, wait a minute!

883
01:39:25,347 --> 01:39:26,765
Oha...

884
01:39:30,102 --> 01:39:34,189
You have been inconvenienced,
and I'm prepared to compensate you.

885
01:39:34,398 --> 01:39:37,651
- Shall we say 1 million dollars?
- No way.

886
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:41,322
- 2 million.
- You can't buy my daughter off.

887
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:45,075
- Nonsense!
- Jaffe, apologise to Mr McDowell.

888
01:39:45,284 --> 01:39:48,829
I will not. The man is beneath me,
and so is his daughter.

889
01:39:49,038 --> 01:39:52,458
I don't give a damn who you are.
This is America, Jack.

890
01:39:52,666 --> 01:39:57,755
You say one more word about Lisa,
and I'll break my foot off in your ass.

891
01:39:59,131 --> 01:40:02,843
- Pardon me?
- What's everybody yelling about?

892
01:40:03,052 --> 01:40:07,097
Their son, the Prince, loves your sister,
but the King can't handle it.

893
01:40:07,306 --> 01:40:10,726
No, he's not.
The Prince is in love with me.

894
01:40:16,148 --> 01:40:19,318
- Are you all right?
- Yes, Mother. I'm fine.

895
01:40:19,526 --> 01:40:22,529
Why are you hugging him?
He's just the servant.

896
01:40:23,864 --> 01:40:27,201
He's the Prince.

897
01:40:28,619 --> 01:40:31,163
Who told you that?

898
01:40:37,503 --> 01:40:41,548
- You mean Akeem's the Prince?
- Yeah, and he's in love with Lisa.

899
01:40:41,757 --> 01:40:44,927
How come she always gets
the good ones?

900
01:40:47,805 --> 01:40:51,642
- Where is Lisa?
- Your daddy ran her off.

901
01:40:55,688 --> 01:40:58,691
- What did you tell her?
- It is of no consequence.

902
01:40:58,899 --> 01:41:03,362
- We shall return to Zamunda at once.
- I will not leave without Lisa.

903
01:41:03,571 --> 01:41:06,448
So you do care for her?

904
01:41:08,117 --> 01:41:11,078
Mother, I love her.

905
01:41:11,287 --> 01:41:13,914
Then go after her.

906
01:41:18,544 --> 01:41:23,549
- Akeem! I forbid you.
- Put a sock in it, Jaffe. The boy's in love.

907
01:41:49,992 --> 01:41:52,453
Darryl, what happened?

908
01:41:54,330 --> 01:41:58,959
- Lisa dumped me.
- I know. You poor thing.

909
01:42:01,003 --> 01:42:06,425
The first thing we have to do
is get you out of these wet clothes.

910
01:42:08,802 --> 01:42:10,763
Stop!

911
01:42:10,971 --> 01:42:12,932
Lisa!

912
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:14,683
Lisa!

913
01:42:19,980 --> 01:42:22,233
I will be fine by myself.

914
01:43:13,075 --> 01:43:15,286
Lisa, please.

915
01:43:16,203 --> 01:43:19,290
I did not mean to hurt you.

916
01:43:19,498 --> 01:43:23,335
Well, at least I know
who gave me these.

917
01:43:23,544 --> 01:43:27,089
You can keep them,
'cause I don't want them...

918
01:43:27,298 --> 01:43:29,925
...and I don't want you.

919
01:43:46,692 --> 01:43:48,277
Just leave me alone!

920
01:43:48,485 --> 01:43:51,655
Lisa, please. I love you.

921
01:43:51,864 --> 01:43:54,199
What about the woman
you are supposed to marry?

922
01:43:54,408 --> 01:43:57,328
I don't love her.
Why do you think I came here?

923
01:43:57,536 --> 01:44:00,581
Your father told me -
to sow your royal oats.

924
01:44:00,789 --> 01:44:06,337
I came to America to find my bride.
I came to Queens to find you.

925
01:44:06,545 --> 01:44:10,716
So why did you lie to me? Why didn'
you just tell me you were a prince?

926
01:44:10,925 --> 01:44:14,386
I wanted you to love me for who I am.

927
01:44:14,595 --> 01:44:18,515
- I'm not sure who are.
- I'm the man you fell in love with.

928
01:44:18,724 --> 01:44:21,560
Should it matter that I am a prince?

929
01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:25,814
It shouldn', but I...

930
01:44:26,023 --> 01:44:31,487
Say you never loved me,
and I won't bother you again.

931
01:44:38,661 --> 01:44:41,956
It just wouldn't work out,
we're too different.

932
01:44:42,164 --> 01:44:44,625
You're royalty, for God's sake.

933
01:44:44,833 --> 01:44:46,794
Do you want me
to renounce my throne? I will.

934
01:44:47,002 --> 01:44:51,340
I renounce my throne. I am no longer
the Prince of Zamunda.

935
01:44:51,549 --> 01:44:53,801
I renounce my throne!

936
01:44:58,264 --> 01:45:01,141
Does this make you happy?

937
01:45:09,984 --> 01:45:13,404
I can't let you do that.

938
01:45:13,612 --> 01:45:16,490
I do not care about my crown.

939
01:45:16,699 --> 01:45:19,702
All I care about is you.

940
01:45:19,910 --> 01:45:22,538
Marry me, Lisa.

941
01:45:27,084 --> 01:45:32,631
- So, what do you think?
- Go on, honey. Take a chance.

942
01:45:45,644 --> 01:45:50,691
Look, I'm sorry. I can'.
Goodbye, Akeem.

943
01:45:58,073 --> 01:46:01,744
If you're really a prince, I'll marry you.

944
01:47:18,612 --> 01:47:23,659
Look at it this way. At least we learned
how to make French fries.

945
01:47:50,102 --> 01:47:53,063
You're still not speaking to me.

946
01:47:54,106 --> 01:47:57,484
- I only want our son to be happy.
- And so do I.

947
01:47:57,693 --> 01:48:01,155
Aoleon, please. It is out of our hands.
The girl told him no.

948
01:48:01,363 --> 01:48:04,617
After the way you treated her,
who could blame her?

949
01:48:04,825 --> 01:48:09,121
Even if she said yes, they still couldn'
marry. It's against the tradition.

950
01:48:09,330 --> 01:48:11,957
Well, it is a stupid tradition.

951
01:48:12,708 --> 01:48:17,004
- Who am I to change it?
- I thought you were the King.

952
01:49:40,754 --> 01:49:46,051
Your Highness.
We have not come to that part yet.

953
01:49:53,684 --> 01:49:57,730
Your Highness. Your Highness!

954
01:50:25,633 --> 01:50:28,135
Would you really
have given this up for me?

955
01:50:28,344 --> 01:50:31,847
Of course. If you like,
we can give it all up now.

956
01:50:34,892 --> 01:50:36,477
Nah!

957
01:51:45,379 --> 01:51:48,340
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Stop right there.

958
01:51:48,549 --> 01:51:51,135
Listen! Stop right there a minute.

959
01:51:51,343 --> 01:51:54,179
A man goes in to a restaurant.
Are you listening?

960
01:51:54,388 --> 01:51:58,893
A man goes into a restaurant.
He sits down and has a bowl of soup.

961
01:51:59,101 --> 01:52:01,812
He says to the waiter,
"Come, taste the soup".

962
01:52:02,021 --> 01:52:04,857
The waiter says, "Is there something
wrong with the soup?" "Taste the soup."

963
01:52:05,065 --> 01:52:08,110
"Is the soup too hot?"
"Will you taste the soup?"

964
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:11,196
"Is the soup too cold?"
"Will you just taste the soup!"

965
01:52:11,405 --> 01:52:14,533
"All right, I'll taste the soup.
Where's the spoon?"

966
01:52:21,707 --> 01:52:24,418
What do you know from funny,
you bastard?

967
01:56:39,924 --> 01:56:41,967
ENGLISH

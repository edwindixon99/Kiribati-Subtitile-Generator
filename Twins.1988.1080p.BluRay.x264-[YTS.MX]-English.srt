1
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,569
On his 35th birthday...

2
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,883
I decided to tell Julius Benedict...

3
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,705
the truth about himself.

4
00:00:38,131 --> 00:00:40,842
Julius already knew
that he was the product...

5
00:00:40,926 --> 00:00:42,962
of a scientific experiment...

6
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:45,334
conducted by the American government.

7
00:00:48,694 --> 00:00:52,632
A top-secret experiment designed
to produce a physically...

8
00:00:52,693 --> 00:00:55,858
mentally and spiritually
advanced human being.

9
00:01:00,279 --> 00:01:03,032
He knew that,
unlike other little boys...

10
00:01:03,115 --> 00:01:06,870
he had not one, but six fathers-

11
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:08,898
all very distinguished men...

12
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:11,921
especially chosen for
their genetic excellence.

13
00:01:14,544 --> 00:01:16,014
And of course...

14
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:19,245
he knew about Mary Ann Benedict...

15
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:24,253
the remarkable young woman...

16
00:01:24,314 --> 00:01:26,720
who was selected to be his mother.

17
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:48,246
Sadly, he had long lived
with the tragic knowledge...

18
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,085
that his mother died
while giving birth to him.

19
00:01:57,005 --> 00:01:59,758
Now, what Julius did not know...

20
00:01:59,883 --> 00:02:02,761
not until this very moment...

21
00:02:02,886 --> 00:02:07,099
was that about a minute
after he was born...

22
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:11,938
his mother gave birth
to another baby boy.

23
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:01,476
I have a brother?

24
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:03,408
Ya.

25
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,412
He was sent to an
orphanage in Los Angeles...

26
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,132
at the same time I brought
you here to the island.

27
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:16,705
Julius had spent his entire life
here on the island...

28
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:19,181
helping me with my research.

29
00:03:20,733 --> 00:03:24,053
I always thought he was happy,
and had no desire to leave.

30
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,560
How wrong I was.

31
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:28,875
I must find him.

32
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:33,971
Julius, Julius! Wait, wait.

33
00:03:36,642 --> 00:03:39,096
I couldn't believe he was going.

34
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,646
He wasn't equipped to deal
with the outside world.

35
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:48,260
All of his knowledge was from books.

36
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:52,542
Julius could speak 12 languages.

37
00:03:52,718 --> 00:03:54,619
He excelled in history, science...

38
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,313
mathematics, literature.

39
00:03:57,844 --> 00:04:00,589
He was pure in body and in spirit.

40
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,043
Ahhh!

41
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:05,453
But for the first time...

42
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:08,117
Julius would not listen to me.

43
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:10,183
He's probably just like me.

44
00:04:19,854 --> 00:04:24,467
The nearest island with
an airport was 27 Miles away.

45
00:04:28,179 --> 00:04:30,643
But Julius did not care.

46
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,448
He had become obsessed with the idea...

47
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:36,971
that his brother, Vincent,
was in some kind of trouble...

48
00:04:37,306 --> 00:04:39,892
and desperately needed his help.

49
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:46,893
Honey, I'm home!

50
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,594
-Oh, no!
-Oh, no.

51
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,602
-Get going!
-I'm going.

52
00:05:15,917 --> 00:05:17,617
Oh, hello, hello!

53
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:19,296
Oh, my goodness!

54
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,252
Goodbye.

55
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:42,107
-We're gonna be late for work.
-I need my horoscope.

56
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:45,569
-Yeah, horoscope.
-'Your judgement is at its peak today.'

57
00:05:45,694 --> 00:05:48,934
Use it wisely,
and romance will follow.'

58
00:05:48,995 --> 00:05:52,039
-Ooh, good one.
-I hope so. Who knows.

59
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,880
Ladies!

60
00:05:56,026 --> 00:05:57,957
-Vince!
-I thought you broke up with him.

61
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:00,050
I did, I did!

62
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,784
You don't mind if I talk
to your sister, do you?

63
00:06:06,604 --> 00:06:07,675
She doesn't mind.

64
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:10,422
Don't give him any money.

65
00:06:10,862 --> 00:06:15,169
Uh, no, no, I promised Marnie
I wouldn't give you any money.

66
00:06:20,205 --> 00:06:22,175
Don't look at me like-

67
00:06:22,236 --> 00:06:24,862
don't do that thing with your eyes.

68
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:28,383
I'm not even supposed
to be here with you.

69
00:06:28,706 --> 00:06:31,506
You are here, and so am I.

70
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,599
Maybe millions of people go by...

71
00:06:35,316 --> 00:06:37,404
But they all disappear from view.

72
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:40,279
I only have eyes for you, Linda.

73
00:06:41,178 --> 00:06:44,140
I only have eyes for you.

74
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:48,352
Mmm.

75
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:53,407
-It's the baby Klane!
-What?

76
00:06:55,796 --> 00:06:57,158
-Hi.
-Hi.

77
00:06:58,197 --> 00:07:01,116
-Can I help you?
-Uh, yeah.

78
00:07:01,873 --> 00:07:03,302
Where's the little shit?

79
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,378
You'll have to be more specific...

80
00:07:06,461 --> 00:07:08,094
concerning the clientele.

81
00:07:08,155 --> 00:07:08,780
Benedict.

82
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:12,336
Oh, he wouldn't come in here.

83
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,763
-Isn't that right, Marnie?
-Who, Vincent?

84
00:07:17,724 --> 00:07:20,233
That weasel? That creep?

85
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,531
I wouldn't serve him if he crawled in
on his hands and knees.

86
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:29,910
Take out the papers and the trash

87
00:07:31,227 --> 00:07:33,622
or you don't get no spending cash

88
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:37,266
if you don't scrub that kitchen floor

89
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,585
you ain't gonna rock and roll no more

90
00:07:40,646 --> 00:07:42,600
yakety-yak don't talk back

91
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,911
I knew you were trouble
the second I laid eyes on you.

92
00:07:48,913 --> 00:07:53,249
Excuse me. I just have never
heard this kind of music before.

93
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:44,495
Thank you.

94
00:09:43,834 --> 00:09:44,848
Hey, Vince!

95
00:09:46,374 --> 00:09:47,572
Listen, Al...

96
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:49,847
you gotta help me out.

97
00:09:50,071 --> 00:09:52,108
I'm into the Klane
brothers for $20,000.

98
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,632
-You borrowed money from a loan shark?
-What do you got?

99
00:09:56,588 --> 00:09:58,321
-Got anything for me?
-I got something for you

100
00:09:58,382 --> 00:09:59,081
See what you got.

101
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:01,960
We're doing this too often, Vince.

102
00:10:02,021 --> 00:10:03,203
Alright. I'll give you something.

103
00:10:03,892 --> 00:10:08,219
Lemme see. Alright. I got a
nice BMW up on 4, stall 20.

104
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,504
Vince, I'll take all
of these you can get.

105
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,318
All right, Tony.

106
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,179
-For you.
-Thanks, Tony.

107
00:10:52,387 --> 00:10:53,134
Yeah.

108
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,893
Whoa, Tony!

109
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:59,455
There's only $4000 here.
For a car like this is $6000.

110
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:01,873
We're in a recession.
Everything's tough.

111
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,329
You wanna try someone else,
no hard feelings.

112
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,753
No, I just could've used some more.

113
00:11:08,654 --> 00:11:11,006
-You okay, Vince? You seem worried.
-Yeah.

114
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:12,907
What's the matter? Your
bowels troubling you?

115
00:11:23,272 --> 00:11:24,724
What an amazing country.

116
00:11:26,139 --> 00:11:26,656
Hey.

117
00:11:28,266 --> 00:11:29,117
Gotta light, pal?

118
00:11:30,821 --> 00:11:33,783
Oh, excuse me.
I don't smoke, pal.

119
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:35,405
Yeah. Ha-ha.

120
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,453
Yeah, good stuff, huh?

121
00:11:39,577 --> 00:11:42,590
-Pickin' up something for the girlfriend?
-I don't have a girlfriend.

122
00:11:42,987 --> 00:11:44,964
Do women really wear those things?

123
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,007
If you're lucky, they do.

124
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:47,622
I can't believe it.

125
00:11:49,088 --> 00:11:51,656
-You're from out of town?
-Yes.

126
00:11:51,717 --> 00:11:54,807
As a matter of fact, I come from
an island in the South Pacific.

127
00:11:57,808 --> 00:11:58,714
Whoa!

128
00:12:01,718 --> 00:12:03,765
What the hell did you do to him, man!

129
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:06,747
I did nothing.
The pavement was his enemy.

130
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:08,335
Let me check him out.

131
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:10,797
A light concussion.

132
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,317
Uh-oh.

133
00:12:13,378 --> 00:12:15,324
-I carry him to a hospital.
-No!

134
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:17,355
I think you should just take off, man.

135
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,198
Find your horse you came in on.
Good bye.

136
00:12:19,302 --> 00:12:21,220
I'm so sorry about this.

137
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,067
-I feel terrible.
-Me, too. Thanks a lot.

138
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:25,874
-Sorry.
-Yeah, I'm sorry.

139
00:12:27,223 --> 00:12:29,651
The next time you should
really consider wearing helmets.

140
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:32,415
Yeah, have a nice day.

141
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:36,139
You don't have to buy them.
Just don't say they're cheap!

142
00:12:36,363 --> 00:12:38,139
These are quality socks.

143
00:12:39,974 --> 00:12:43,418
What a day it's been.
Oh, no, no, no!

144
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:46,247
Oh, oh! Jesus Christ!

145
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:49,604
$53! Are you out of your mind?

146
00:12:50,774 --> 00:12:53,129
Your vehicle is in a handicapped zone,
if you didn't notice.

147
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:55,337
So, do I look normal to you?

148
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:57,780
You don't have a handicapped
sticker in your windshield.

149
00:12:57,838 --> 00:13:00,967
Oh, come on.
You don't need a sticker.

150
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,052
Handicapped, my ass!

151
00:13:03,136 --> 00:13:05,647
I'll need your driver's license, sir.

152
00:13:05,972 --> 00:13:08,442
Look, I'm sorry I lost my temper.

153
00:13:08,503 --> 00:13:09,591
Driver's license, please.

154
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:12,806
-Look, I had a very bad day.
-Driver's license... please.

155
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:17,317
You've got over 200 outstanding
parking tickets, Mr. Benedict.

156
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:20,163
You just had your birthday.
Your driver's license expired.

157
00:13:20,677 --> 00:13:22,214
Happy Birthday. Watch your head.

158
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:22,948
Thanks.

159
00:13:32,157 --> 00:13:32,931
Come along, now.

160
00:13:34,488 --> 00:13:36,580
So this is where my brother grew up.

161
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,374
I'm so happy he had so many
children to play with.

162
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:47,061
And that's where he must have slept!

163
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,246
Yes, it was.

164
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,544
How did you know?

165
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:55,418
It's the one I'd have chosen,
close to the fire extinguisher.

166
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,742
In case of a fire...

167
00:13:56,803 --> 00:14:00,265
I could have given the alarm
and saved all the other orphans.

168
00:14:01,647 --> 00:14:04,289
We've had only one fire
in here at St. Charlotte's.

169
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:08,257
Vince Benedict started it,
we like to think by accident.

170
00:14:11,146 --> 00:14:12,964
Tell me a little bit about Vincent.

171
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:17,927
Was he a great athlete?
Interested in chess and poetry?

172
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm certain God had a purpose
when he created Vince Benedict...

173
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:23,618
but it had nothing
to do with chess or poetry.

174
00:14:23,702 --> 00:14:24,711
Oh, I'm sorry.

175
00:14:26,926 --> 00:14:30,007
Odd, the contents
of his files are missing.

176
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:32,895
That is Vince?

177
00:14:34,127 --> 00:14:35,494
He looks so happy.

178
00:14:35,865 --> 00:14:38,167
He should.
That's sister Maria...

179
00:14:38,228 --> 00:14:41,680
-his biology teacher.
-I always liked biology.

180
00:14:42,303 --> 00:14:43,353
So did Vincent.

181
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:45,846
He disgraced sister Maria...

182
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:47,593
who had to leave the order.

183
00:14:47,796 --> 00:14:51,416
Then he stole all the money from
the library fund, and ran away.

184
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:53,970
I must find my brother.

185
00:14:54,204 --> 00:14:55,562
Do you know where he might be?

186
00:14:55,623 --> 00:14:58,571
Jail, a man of his character
can only be in jail.

187
00:14:59,672 --> 00:15:03,589
You're full of goodness, Julius.
I pray you never find him.

188
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:10,111
Benedict, visitor.

189
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:02,499
-I'm looking for Vincent Benedict.
-You got him.

190
00:16:31,112 --> 00:16:33,596
I have rowed halfway
across the world-

191
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:35,411
Wrong, I just rowed a day-

192
00:16:38,827 --> 00:16:42,157
I've been looking forward to
this moment my whole life.

193
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:45,366
I've been on my island,
I'm telling you.

194
00:16:45,435 --> 00:16:48,800
This is incredible that-
I have looked for-

195
00:16:57,014 --> 00:17:00,017
You've gotta talk into the phone, Bozo.

196
00:17:01,533 --> 00:17:04,694
Vincent. Dearest, Vincent...

197
00:17:04,925 --> 00:17:06,627
I know you don't know who I am.

198
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:09,659
-But believe me, I came-
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!

199
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,172
I've got another six hours
to pay the money back.

200
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:15,969
Tell the Klane brothers that harassing
a man already in the slammer...

201
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:17,537
is beneath even them, all right?

202
00:17:17,656 --> 00:17:21,519
I don't know any Klane brothers.
I'm your brother, Julius.

203
00:17:22,978 --> 00:17:24,599
Huh? Come again?

204
00:17:25,275 --> 00:17:28,277
My name is Julius,
and I'm your twin brother.

205
00:17:33,574 --> 00:17:34,759
Oh, obviously.

206
00:17:35,134 --> 00:17:38,076
The moment I sat down, I thought
I was looking into a mirror.

207
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:40,499
We are not identical twins.

208
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,603
-Oh, no?
-No.

209
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:44,374
I wouldn't be too sure, pal.

210
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:46,764
I don't lie. I am your brother.

211
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:49,043
You must let me help
you get out of here.

212
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:51,281
You want to help me get out?

213
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:52,825
Yes, right now.

214
00:17:53,952 --> 00:17:56,711
Well, money talks, and bullshit walks.

215
00:18:00,936 --> 00:18:04,206
How can bullshit walk?
That's slang, huh?

216
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:05,559
Yeah.

217
00:18:06,015 --> 00:18:07,553
I'm in fast company here.

218
00:18:07,614 --> 00:18:09,433
Take a look over there.
See that man?

219
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:12,830
Pay him money, all right?
They let me out.

220
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:16,375
I'll be anything you want,
your aunt, Uncle, sister...

221
00:18:16,436 --> 00:18:18,512
your cousin,
brother-in-law, anything.

222
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,680
-All right?
-Okay, I pay right now.

223
00:18:20,741 --> 00:18:22,164
-You pay now.
-Okay, Vince.

224
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:23,901
Okay. Go pay.

225
00:18:25,069 --> 00:18:26,105
All right, pay him.

226
00:18:28,998 --> 00:18:30,591
What is this, 'candid camera'?

227
00:18:32,881 --> 00:18:35,196
Ahhh, oof!

228
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,036
Twinny, I hope you didn't
blow your wad on the tickets...

229
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,231
because I'm gonna need
a lot more money to get my car.

230
00:18:44,403 --> 00:18:46,363
-I have more money.
-You do?

231
00:18:46,602 --> 00:18:49,453
I'm glad to help you.
Vincent, I'm your brother.

232
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,948
-I love you.
-Whoa!

233
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:54,987
Look, ease up on the love talk...

234
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:57,670
because I'm gonna be tossing
my cookies in a minute.

235
00:18:58,889 --> 00:18:59,995
Tossing your cookies?

236
00:19:00,326 --> 00:19:02,018
Oh, that's more slang!

237
00:19:03,687 --> 00:19:04,987
Where the hell is it?

238
00:19:08,568 --> 00:19:10,866
-This is your car, isn't it?
-Yeah, that's it.

239
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,191
You pay a huge fine,
then they hide it on you.

240
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:16,144
-How'd you know this was my car?
-We're twins!

241
00:19:16,817 --> 00:19:20,321
I'm so excited. Now we can
go to museums together...

242
00:19:20,421 --> 00:19:22,914
talk philosophy together,
read books together.

243
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,675
-Play chess together.
-Get lost together.

244
00:19:29,813 --> 00:19:30,559
Vincent!

245
00:19:37,082 --> 00:19:38,364
He's so full of energy.

246
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:45,524
Blue sedan DeVille.

247
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:47,561
This is beautiful.

248
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:49,722
Where you guys going, out to Hawaii?

249
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,354
-Catch some of them big waves?
-Yeah, something like that.

250
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:54,837
We have plenty of room on level 4.

251
00:20:42,296 --> 00:20:43,456
I'll call you next Saturday.

252
00:20:45,044 --> 00:20:46,218
Whoa, where you going with my desk?

253
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,240
Takin' back this furniture, man.

254
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:50,042
You're six months behind.

255
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:52,535
You're behind!

256
00:20:53,214 --> 00:20:55,383
Six months behind.
That's the problem.

257
00:20:55,444 --> 00:20:57,738
There's no trust in the world any more.

258
00:20:58,514 --> 00:20:59,950
I tried to stop them, Mr. Benedict.

259
00:21:00,011 --> 00:21:02,659
That's all right, it was
time to redecorate anyway.

260
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:07,076
Vincent Benedict incorporated.

261
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:09,177
-Sports agent...
-Airborne!

262
00:21:11,242 --> 00:21:13,083
-Mr. Benedict?
-Yeah?

263
00:21:13,705 --> 00:21:16,578
-It's Al.
-It's Al? Ooh, Al, Al, Al.

264
00:21:17,947 --> 00:21:21,096
Look, Miss Busby, uh-
Al, hang on a second.

265
00:21:21,742 --> 00:21:24,635
The corporation's in
a transitional period right now.

266
00:21:24,696 --> 00:21:28,730
Take a couple of days off.
When we regroup, I'll call you.

267
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:30,703
Whatever you think is best.

268
00:21:30,764 --> 00:21:32,015
-All right.
-I'll take this.

269
00:21:33,424 --> 00:21:34,576
Yeah, go ahead. Take that.

270
00:21:34,817 --> 00:21:36,402
Before I forget,

271
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:39,081
Happy Birthday.

272
00:21:41,784 --> 00:21:43,166
Oh, how sweet.

273
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:45,898
That's very, very nice of you.

274
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:49,849
-Aqua Velva?
-Mm-hmm.

275
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,228
You shouldn't have. Stacey.

276
00:21:56,176 --> 00:21:57,500
I'll give you a call, okay?

277
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,787
All right, all right.

278
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:02,977
Al, save me!

279
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:05,108
Brand-new caddy on level 4.

280
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:07,955
I'll be there! Don't move! Bye.

281
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:14,775
Whoa!

282
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:20,800
Time's up, Vincent.

283
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:30,785
Did you hit me?
Because I didn't feel a thing.

284
00:22:33,443 --> 00:22:34,446
I felt that.

285
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:38,173
You gotta understand
something, Benedict.

286
00:22:38,801 --> 00:22:39,913
I like my work.

287
00:22:44,617 --> 00:22:46,847
These are the most unfriendly acts
you're committing.

288
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:48,213
I don't know what the problem is...

289
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:49,585
but I'm sure it can be resolved...

290
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:51,899
-without resorting to violence.
-Yeah.

291
00:22:53,491 --> 00:22:54,171
Okay?

292
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:54,970
Okay.

293
00:23:00,705 --> 00:23:02,537
-You moved too soon.
-He did?

294
00:23:02,633 --> 00:23:03,717
Ahhh!

295
00:23:06,351 --> 00:23:08,298
A little chest pain?

296
00:23:09,585 --> 00:23:11,771
The first rule in a crisis situation:

297
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:15,573
You negotiate first
and you attack last.

298
00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:17,411
You negotiate first, then you attack.

299
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:19,327
-You never negotiated.
-Na-hah!

300
00:23:19,388 --> 00:23:20,945
You don't know what
kind of an enemy I am.

301
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:23,779
-Who are you?
-I'm Vincent's brother.

302
00:23:24,882 --> 00:23:26,968
-We're twins.
-That's right.

303
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:31,065
-You're firewood!
-Axe, axe, axe!

304
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:34,583
You have no respect for logic.

305
00:23:35,051 --> 00:23:37,244
-But he's got an axe!
-Ahhhh!

306
00:23:41,017 --> 00:23:44,112
And I have no respect for those
who have no respect for logic.

307
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:49,119
You're a very stupid person.

308
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:54,132
You tell your brother...

309
00:23:54,219 --> 00:23:57,716
he messes with me, he messes
with my whole family!

310
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,378
I love it when you hit people, Julius.

311
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:06,353
Boom!

312
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:09,151
That was great!

313
00:24:09,819 --> 00:24:11,175
Actually, I hate violence.

314
00:24:11,342 --> 00:24:12,731
But you're so good at it!

315
00:24:13,557 --> 00:24:15,942
I've got an idea. We should
go into business together.

316
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:18,268
You could be a boxer.
I could be your manager.

317
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,579
-I don't think I could fight for money.
-No problem!

318
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,550
You do all the fighting,
I'll keep all the money.

319
00:24:25,532 --> 00:24:27,271
I'm really worried about you, Vincent.

320
00:24:29,658 --> 00:24:30,924
How much money do you owe?

321
00:24:32,715 --> 00:24:35,510
Don't lie to me. We're twins.

322
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,556
-I can feel your pain.
-Why do you keep saying that?

323
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:41,061
We're not twins.
We're not brothers.

324
00:24:41,199 --> 00:24:42,025
We're nothin'!

325
00:24:48,606 --> 00:24:49,495
Twenty thousand.

326
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,115
Due this morning.

327
00:25:00,418 --> 00:25:01,618
Come on.

328
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:13,672
Don't worry about anything, Vincent.

329
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:17,726
As long as I'm with you,
I won't let anyone harm you, okay?

330
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:24,254
Well, you're a good guy, Julius.

331
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:27,889
Now, hang on to your seat!

332
00:25:38,736 --> 00:25:41,578
You know what?
I completely forgot.

333
00:25:41,745 --> 00:25:43,437
I promised this friend, Sammy...

334
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,671
that I'd pick his car up
from the airport.

335
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:46,967
Put it in the slot.

336
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:48,917
Would you do me a big favour?

337
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:51,976
Would you drive this car back
from the airport for me?

338
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,171
Oh, I would love to.

339
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,728
Good, that would really be a big help.

340
00:25:58,026 --> 00:25:59,552
Do you have a manual, please?

341
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,159
-A manual?
-Yeah.

342
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,813
-It's in the glove compartment.
-Oh, yeah.

343
00:26:09,122 --> 00:26:09,932
There it is.

344
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:20,932
-What are you doin' with the finger?
-Learning to drive.

345
00:26:21,891 --> 00:26:23,124
Whoa!

346
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,705
It's not up here.

347
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:27,608
Maybe it's under the back tyre.

348
00:26:28,644 --> 00:26:32,303
Look... I mean, usually he
leaves the keys behind the tyre.

349
00:26:32,488 --> 00:26:34,157
-Geez!
-What's the matter?

350
00:26:34,414 --> 00:26:37,493
That dopey Sam,
he forgot to leave the keys.

351
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:39,532
No. Oh, well.

352
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:43,217
A lot of handicapped children
are gonna be very disappointed.

353
00:26:44,465 --> 00:26:45,624
Handicapped children?

354
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:49,880
This car was supposed to be auctioned
off at their charity drive tomorrow.

355
00:26:50,126 --> 00:26:51,860
Oh, well. Let's go get
something to eat.

356
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:54,448
Maybe we should try
to open it ourselves.

357
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,699
Do you really think we should do that?

358
00:26:59,128 --> 00:27:00,305
It's for children.

359
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,169
You got a point.

360
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:10,256
I saw a guy from
the auto club do this once.

361
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:13,856
What do you know, beginners luck!

362
00:27:16,387 --> 00:27:18,550
These cars have terrific alarms!

363
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:19,971
I'll get it in a minute.

364
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,132
Just a second, Jules.

365
00:27:26,043 --> 00:27:26,889
Whoa!

366
00:27:29,123 --> 00:27:30,624
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

367
00:27:40,566 --> 00:27:44,863
If you lift the rear end
at an angle greater than 45%...

368
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:47,945
the Mercury switch activates
the automatic cut-off system...

369
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:49,948
so that the alarm's computer thinks...

370
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:52,039
that the car is being
towed and shuts off.

371
00:27:54,227 --> 00:27:55,640
Can I have the keys to your car?

372
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:00,566
You know, the keys to your car?

373
00:28:00,627 --> 00:28:03,793
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No yodelling.

374
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,168
Lovely day.

375
00:28:10,492 --> 00:28:11,719
Come on, Julius.

376
00:28:27,855 --> 00:28:28,928
Step on it!

377
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,524
Yeeeoow!

378
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:45,974
Oh, my God!

379
00:28:46,576 --> 00:28:49,711
-I am amazed at how well it's going.
-You're doing good.

380
00:28:49,837 --> 00:28:52,422
Don't use both feet at the same time.

381
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:56,207
-Just use the gas.
-Okay, one foot.

382
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,625
-One pedal at a time.
-Okay! I will do it!

383
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:21,059
Pick up the phone, the phone.

384
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,721
The little thing down on
the right that's making noise.

385
00:29:30,984 --> 00:29:33,341
This is Vincent's car.
Can I help you, please?

386
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:36,096
-Julius!
-Vincent, where are you?

387
00:29:36,157 --> 00:29:38,701
Look in your rear-view mirror.
You see that little dot?

388
00:29:40,956 --> 00:29:41,896
That's me.

389
00:29:41,957 --> 00:29:43,868
Hello, yeah. Hello!

390
00:29:45,553 --> 00:29:47,009
What are you doing back there?

391
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:51,452
There's going to be a lot of
lights coming up, a supermarket.

392
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:55,025
-Supermarket.
-Take your foot off the gas.

393
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:58,191
Apply it to the brake.
It's the thing next to the gas.

394
00:29:58,252 --> 00:29:59,338
The brake pedal.

395
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,193
-Very gently.
-You got it.

396
00:30:02,393 --> 00:30:03,505
Bye, Vincent.

397
00:30:04,924 --> 00:30:05,775
All right.

398
00:30:12,817 --> 00:30:14,383
Okay, it's a supermarket.

399
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:23,791
Ohhh!

400
00:30:24,017 --> 00:30:25,252
Ohhh!

401
00:30:37,786 --> 00:30:39,062
That's what I call fun.

402
00:30:39,175 --> 00:30:40,965
Did you see me with the two wheels?

403
00:30:41,165 --> 00:30:42,960
I can teach you that, Vincent.

404
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,722
Julius, let me tell you
something about America.

405
00:30:46,793 --> 00:30:49,047
Nobody likes a smart ass, all right?

406
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,473
So, what do you think?

407
00:30:52,248 --> 00:30:54,048
Angel's food or devil's food?

408
00:30:55,513 --> 00:30:56,207
Devil's.

409
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:59,328
-You know what I really love about Vince?
-What?

410
00:31:00,206 --> 00:31:01,519
He's a force of nature.

411
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,553
-You're outta control.
-No, I'm not.

412
00:31:03,614 --> 00:31:06,367
That poetry he pretends to write,
they're old song lyrics.

413
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:09,666
I know. Geez,
you think I don't know that!

414
00:31:09,727 --> 00:31:11,547
-I don't think you know that.
-Well, I do.

415
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,416
It's this style thing.
That's how he expresses himself.

416
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:18,482
And he means it, even if
he doesn't know he means it.

417
00:31:18,897 --> 00:31:23,860
-Vince has a truly romantic soul.
-I can't hear this any more.

418
00:31:24,297 --> 00:31:27,463
Well, don't, 'cause if you
had a boyfriend like I have...

419
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:30,064
you'd make him a cake
and he'd love it...

420
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,429
and you'd get laid.

421
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:48,072
-Ah!
-Excuse me.

422
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:49,968
Excuse me.

423
00:31:53,148 --> 00:31:54,268
She's not bad.

424
00:31:55,092 --> 00:31:57,906
I had no idea that these magazines...

425
00:31:57,967 --> 00:32:01,664
had things like
this inside, inside them.

426
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:04,816
You didn't? Where've you been?
A desert island?

427
00:32:06,295 --> 00:32:09,245
I come from a tropical island
in the South Pacific.

428
00:32:09,328 --> 00:32:13,208
It's around 300 nautical Miles,
South, southwest of Fiji.

429
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,024
I just got here yesterday
and I already found my brother.

430
00:32:17,762 --> 00:32:18,544
Your brother?

431
00:32:20,606 --> 00:32:21,613
That's right.

432
00:32:21,913 --> 00:32:23,376
My twin brother, Vincent.

433
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:26,072
-Twins?
-Vince!

434
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:29,175
-Linda.
-Hi.

435
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:32,689
Oh, you look gorgeous in this light.

436
00:32:33,366 --> 00:32:34,640
-You do.
-Really?

437
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:42,546
Hi. Who's this guy?

438
00:32:42,775 --> 00:32:44,562
This is Vincent's brother.

439
00:32:44,623 --> 00:32:47,748
-I didn't know you had a brother.
-Me, either.

440
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,459
You know each other?

441
00:32:50,508 --> 00:32:52,708
Allow me to introduce
these lovely ladies.

442
00:32:52,886 --> 00:32:54,923
-This is Linda.
-Hi.

443
00:32:57,034 --> 00:32:59,632
-Hello.
-Her charming sister, Marnie.

444
00:33:02,957 --> 00:33:04,057
Sisters?

445
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:06,074
Twins?

446
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:09,468
Are you sure this guy's all right?

447
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,095
He's okay. He's helping me out.

448
00:33:11,994 --> 00:33:15,420
He's from outta town,
kinda latched on to me.

449
00:33:16,234 --> 00:33:18,286
Okay, well, great seeing ya.

450
00:33:18,436 --> 00:33:19,510
Catch ya later.

451
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:24,059
Great seeing ya. Catch ya later.

452
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,442
Oops!

453
00:33:29,082 --> 00:33:30,797
I've only been driving an hour.

454
00:33:35,043 --> 00:33:37,845
-Linda's your girlfriend, isn't she?
-Yeah, kinda.

455
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,644
-Is Marnie your girlfriend, too?
-Marnie?

456
00:33:41,705 --> 00:33:45,272
Marnie hates my guts.
She kinda likes you, though.

457
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:47,294
-Me?
-Yeah.

458
00:33:48,723 --> 00:33:51,450
-She hardly knows me.
-That's the best way.

459
00:33:52,467 --> 00:33:54,950
You see, women love men...

460
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:57,177
who are mysterious and devious.

461
00:33:57,389 --> 00:33:59,391
Keeps them on their toes.

462
00:33:59,452 --> 00:34:01,634
-It excites them. You know what I mean?
-No.

463
00:34:02,162 --> 00:34:04,832
-You do like women?
-Very much so.

464
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:06,812
They're strange and sensitive.

465
00:34:07,566 --> 00:34:08,740
They have compassion.

466
00:34:09,458 --> 00:34:11,513
I have the highest respect for women.

467
00:34:17,814 --> 00:34:18,887
You're a virgin!

468
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:23,431
That's private.

469
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,419
A 230-pound virgin.

470
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:32,321
It's all right. It's something-

471
00:34:32,382 --> 00:34:33,971
it's just one of those things.

472
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:39,617
Oh, Julius.
My little baby poodle.

473
00:34:40,092 --> 00:34:44,065
Such a baby cat.
Look, did I neglect you?

474
00:34:44,269 --> 00:34:46,182
Not any more. Come on.

475
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:49,993
That's a good little pussy cat.
This is sweet Julius.

476
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:52,198
Okay, here you go.

477
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,249
You named your cat Julius?

478
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:04,004
The secret to take-out eggplant
parmesan is extra cheese.

479
00:35:04,784 --> 00:35:07,537
-There we go.
-That much cheese?

480
00:35:07,598 --> 00:35:09,588
Oh, yeah.
The more cheese, the merrier.

481
00:35:10,732 --> 00:35:11,545
There you go.

482
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:16,317
I know you're probably used to
growing your own vegetables...

483
00:35:16,378 --> 00:35:20,154
and spearing fish on the lagoon,
but here on the mainland...

484
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:22,034
we just nuke it.

485
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,764
That's it. Here we go.

486
00:35:26,176 --> 00:35:29,481
Feast your eyes.
Dinner is served.

487
00:35:31,323 --> 00:35:33,369
-Yummy.
-Yeah.

488
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:51,049
-Ahhh!
-Ahhh!

489
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,782
Through the lips, over the gums,

490
00:35:52,843 --> 00:35:55,633
look out stomach, here it comes.
Ta-dum!

491
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,201
-Julius!
-Oh, I like nuked food.

492
00:35:59,262 --> 00:36:01,369
-Mm-mmm!
-Mmm!

493
00:36:25,863 --> 00:36:27,093
Now let me get this straight.

494
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:31,582
One of our fathers was
a famous football player?

495
00:36:31,665 --> 00:36:33,494
-Yes!
-And another one was...

496
00:36:33,555 --> 00:36:37,433
-a physicist at M.I.T.?
-Yes, he won the Nobel prize.

497
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:40,929
Naturally! All of our dads
were these big shots.

498
00:36:41,435 --> 00:36:45,786
And mom... was like...
superwoman.

499
00:36:48,817 --> 00:36:50,692
But she didn't survive the delivery.

500
00:36:52,113 --> 00:36:53,873
And I was sent to an orphanage...

501
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:56,835
while you were raised
on a tropical paradise...

502
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:59,668
By a scientist who
you do research for...

503
00:36:59,836 --> 00:37:02,839
but who doesn't pay you,
because you don't need money.

504
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:04,855
Did I leave anything out?

505
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:09,575
I think it's important we try
to find our fathers.

506
00:37:10,408 --> 00:37:12,415
Oh, you mean the geniuses
who contributed...

507
00:37:12,476 --> 00:37:13,805
to the sperm milk shake.

508
00:37:14,341 --> 00:37:16,760
Why are you being so immature
about all this?

509
00:37:16,895 --> 00:37:20,019
Do you know how many times
I've heard stories like this?

510
00:37:20,092 --> 00:37:22,197
It's every orphan's fantasy.

511
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:25,450
My real mom and dad were rich...

512
00:37:25,511 --> 00:37:26,553
and beautiful.

513
00:37:27,354 --> 00:37:30,107
But there was a mix-up
in the hospital...

514
00:37:30,483 --> 00:37:32,634
and I got switched with another baby.

515
00:37:33,233 --> 00:37:36,000
But one day, there's gonna
be a knock at the door...

516
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,738
and there they'll be...

517
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:41,858
with open arms, crying, 'my darling.'

518
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,447
'My treasure. We didn't know.

519
00:37:45,732 --> 00:37:47,547
How can we make it up to you?'

520
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,823
Let me tell you something
for your own good, Julius.

521
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:52,856
It's a crock.

522
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:58,324
I liberated this from
my file at the orphanage.

523
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:02,891
Here it is. Read it and weep.

524
00:38:04,405 --> 00:38:07,507
'Dear Sister Anderson, your request
for orphan's benefits...

525
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:10,441
-'for Vincent Benedict has been denied.'
-Denied, yeah.

526
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:14,148
'According to our files,
his mother did not die...

527
00:38:14,842 --> 00:38:16,719
-'during birth.'
-She's not dead.

528
00:38:16,841 --> 00:38:18,125
'We have a current
address for her at...

529
00:38:18,186 --> 00:38:20,861
'172 Canyon Glen Drive, Los Angeles.

530
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,234
'Vincent's case seems to be
one of simple abandonment...

531
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:27,255
and as such,
he's ineligible for aid.'

532
00:38:27,316 --> 00:38:30,710
That's right, Julius.
She abandoned me.

533
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:36,823
This letter was written 30 years ago.

534
00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:38,790
We were five years old.

535
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:41,744
Our mother didn't die
when we were born!

536
00:38:43,475 --> 00:38:45,455
You knew all this time where she was...

537
00:38:45,642 --> 00:38:47,037
and you never contacted her?

538
00:38:48,047 --> 00:38:51,442
I don't know about your mother,
'Miss Perfect, 1952'...

539
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:54,448
but my mother was a slut
and if she's still alive...

540
00:38:54,509 --> 00:38:56,231
I hope she's in a lot of pain.

541
00:38:56,863 --> 00:38:57,980
She dumped me once.

542
00:38:58,041 --> 00:39:01,035
There is no way I'm gonna give
her a chance to do it again.

543
00:39:02,349 --> 00:39:04,568
If they have lied to us about mama
for all these years...

544
00:39:04,629 --> 00:39:07,642
maybe they lied to her, too.
We got to find her.

545
00:39:07,715 --> 00:39:10,775
-We have to check this address.
-You do what you want.

546
00:39:11,123 --> 00:39:12,535
I got a cash-flow problem.

547
00:39:12,731 --> 00:39:13,488
Hello.

548
00:39:13,694 --> 00:39:16,154
Hey, Vince, we haven't
forgotten about you.

549
00:39:16,547 --> 00:39:18,925
You better have our money
tomorrow morning, or else.

550
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:20,847
Or else what, you blimp?

551
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:35,283
Oh, we're rollin'.

552
00:39:35,559 --> 00:39:37,261
Tests on the new low-temperature
gaskets look great.

553
00:39:37,322 --> 00:39:38,810
-Mr. Garfield, there's a man-
-Not now.

554
00:39:46,899 --> 00:39:47,524
Who are you?

555
00:39:49,203 --> 00:39:49,973
I'm Webster.

556
00:39:51,776 --> 00:39:52,819
It's okay!

557
00:39:53,385 --> 00:39:55,786
Christ! You were never
supposed to come here.

558
00:39:55,847 --> 00:39:57,304
We were never supposed to meet.

559
00:39:57,365 --> 00:40:00,086
-You're supposed to be-
-Driving that car down to Texas.

560
00:40:00,928 --> 00:40:04,413
I got my driving gloves.
I got my driving glasses.

561
00:40:04,474 --> 00:40:06,030
I got my driving hat.

562
00:40:07,233 --> 00:40:08,583
But I got no car.

563
00:40:09,063 --> 00:40:10,192
The car was there.

564
00:40:11,085 --> 00:40:12,447
The merchandise was in the trunk.

565
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,286
Your instructions were on the cassette.

566
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:17,119
He wants more money.
That's what this is about.

567
00:40:17,357 --> 00:40:20,130
-He wants more money.
-Whoa, whoa. Let me explain.

568
00:40:20,998 --> 00:40:21,703
Sit down.

569
00:40:26,952 --> 00:40:28,558
I got a reputation to uphold.

570
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:30,523
People put their trust in me.

571
00:40:30,704 --> 00:40:32,284
They know I always deliver the goods...

572
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:33,932
And I always come back with the money.

573
00:40:34,547 --> 00:40:37,364
This is making me look
very bad professionally.

574
00:40:37,516 --> 00:40:40,383
-This is bullshit. The car was there.
-That's right.

575
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:43,492
The parking attendant
thought we were going to Hawaii.

576
00:40:44,106 --> 00:40:46,238
-The parking attendant?
-He liked the car.

577
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:49,100
We put on those loud shirts
so we'd look like tourists.

578
00:40:50,853 --> 00:40:52,426
You know, I just realized that...

579
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:56,031
in over 20 years of service,
not one of my clients...

580
00:40:56,092 --> 00:40:57,403
has ever seen my face.

581
00:40:57,464 --> 00:40:58,445
I don't think that's a problem.

582
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:00,341
Hey!

583
00:41:02,111 --> 00:41:03,274
No, please, please!

584
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:25,267
-Hi.
-Hi.

585
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:28,328
Oh, excuse me, could you
tell me who lives here?

586
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,051
Grandpa...

587
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:33,206
this man wants to talk to you.

588
00:41:34,588 --> 00:41:35,374
Thank you.

589
00:41:40,427 --> 00:41:41,440
Hello?

590
00:41:42,123 --> 00:41:42,762
Yes, can I help you?

591
00:41:43,275 --> 00:41:45,522
I'm terribly sorry
to disturb your party.

592
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,589
I know this may sound strange...

593
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,494
but I'm looking for someone
that lived here a long time ago.

594
00:41:51,006 --> 00:41:52,278
Mary Ann Benedict.

595
00:42:00,523 --> 00:42:01,523
She was my mother.

596
00:42:05,604 --> 00:42:06,908
You're Mary Ann's son?

597
00:42:09,786 --> 00:42:12,313
That looks just like you, grandpa.

598
00:42:14,118 --> 00:42:15,437
Honey, why don't you go inside...

599
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:17,597
and help grandma with lunch, okay?

600
00:42:31,653 --> 00:42:32,313
Dad?

601
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:35,235
Uh... no!

602
00:42:36,949 --> 00:42:39,694
-But maybe technically speaking.
-Dad!

603
00:42:40,085 --> 00:42:40,864
Dad!

604
00:42:42,054 --> 00:42:44,348
-Wait a minute!
-Dad! It is you!

605
00:42:45,319 --> 00:42:46,526
This is a big surprise.

606
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:49,250
Dad, this is incredible.
I don't know what to-

607
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:51,619
We could use a drink.
Why don't... why don't we go inside?

608
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,642
One of my fathers! You don't know
what this means to me.

609
00:43:13,888 --> 00:43:16,411
Uh, Mr. Webster,
I hope you are happy with the vehicle...

610
00:43:16,472 --> 00:43:17,671
we chose for your little journey.

611
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:22,676
When you get near Houston,
phone 713-555-0342...

612
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:26,476
and ask for uh, uh, Beetroot McKinley.

613
00:43:27,106 --> 00:43:30,586
He will arrange to trade you a briefcase
for the merchandise in the trunk.

614
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:31,432
Thank you.

615
00:43:34,372 --> 00:43:35,832
Mary Ann Benedict.

616
00:43:37,739 --> 00:43:40,770
I haven't said that name
out loud for over 30 years.

617
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:45,480
Your mother was...
an amazing woman.

618
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:50,228
Oh, the times I've wondered what would
have happened if I'd have married her.

619
00:43:51,431 --> 00:43:52,445
Why didn't you?

620
00:43:53,182 --> 00:43:55,487
Oh, I asked her to.
She turned me down.

621
00:43:58,375 --> 00:43:59,005
She...

622
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,837
said she was afraid... to
have any more children.

623
00:44:04,125 --> 00:44:06,862
See, they told her
you had died at birth.

624
00:44:07,655 --> 00:44:08,944
Who told her we died?

625
00:44:14,052 --> 00:44:16,305
Mitchell Traven,
the guy with the clipboard.

626
00:44:16,495 --> 00:44:18,488
He supervised the experiment
for the government.

627
00:44:19,341 --> 00:44:22,762
He still runs a genetics lab
at Los Alamos, New Mexico.

628
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:25,914
I'll have to pay him a visit.

629
00:44:26,627 --> 00:44:27,746
Watch out for him.

630
00:44:28,912 --> 00:44:31,718
He's kind of a dick head,
if you know what I mean.

631
00:44:32,493 --> 00:44:33,235
Dick head?

632
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:36,862
No, I don't.

633
00:44:38,655 --> 00:44:40,992
But... I'm learning.

634
00:44:47,507 --> 00:44:49,334
I'm concerned about the time frame.

635
00:44:50,197 --> 00:44:52,544
That's my private line, honey.
I'll take care of that.

636
00:44:52,996 --> 00:44:54,579
You boys, excuse me.

637
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,024
Beetroot McKinley talkin'.
Who is this?

638
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:07,789
Uh, Webster.

639
00:45:08,555 --> 00:45:11,983
I'm callin' from California.
I happen to have something-

640
00:45:12,088 --> 00:45:15,657
some merchandise that you might want.

641
00:45:17,813 --> 00:45:19,394
Well, bring it to me, son.

642
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:20,485
Let me enrich you.

643
00:45:20,744 --> 00:45:23,337
Well, uh, Mr. Beetroot...

644
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,374
it's the amount of enrichment...

645
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:27,835
that I wanted to talk about.

646
00:45:28,082 --> 00:45:30,969
Don't try and renegotiate
with old Beetroot, son.

647
00:45:32,207 --> 00:45:33,321
Now look, Beetroot...

648
00:45:34,243 --> 00:45:37,674
if we can't renegotiate,
we wither and die.

649
00:45:38,227 --> 00:45:40,082
Look, there's no way, Mr. Beetroot...

650
00:45:40,165 --> 00:45:43,175
that I am going to deliver
any damn Cadillac...

651
00:45:43,622 --> 00:45:47,209
unless I know for sure that I have...

652
00:45:49,425 --> 00:45:50,878
twenty for my cut.

653
00:45:50,939 --> 00:45:53,904
Twenty! You little
shit-for-brains peckerwood!

654
00:45:54,108 --> 00:45:56,773
You're out of your goddam, greedy mind!

655
00:45:56,926 --> 00:46:01,104
-I guess that seems a little high for you.
-Yeah!

656
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:06,145
I'm a reasonable man.
How about fifteen?

657
00:46:06,236 --> 00:46:07,556
The deal is five!

658
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,076
Five?

659
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:13,238
I could do better than five here.

660
00:46:14,944 --> 00:46:18,784
If you can do better
than five million dollars...

661
00:46:20,067 --> 00:46:21,924
well, then, son, you take it.

662
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:38,987
Beetroot, I'll see you in Houston.

663
00:46:40,202 --> 00:46:41,993
After all, fair is fair.

664
00:46:43,443 --> 00:46:46,251
I'll just have to find it in
my heart to live with your offer.

665
00:46:46,835 --> 00:46:47,678
Well, good.

666
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,866
Five million!

667
00:47:02,044 --> 00:47:03,981
Five million dollars!

668
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:06,441
Five mil-l-lion dollars!

669
00:47:06,752 --> 00:47:08,592
Five million dollars!

670
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:12,128
Five, five million dollars!

671
00:47:12,254 --> 00:47:15,174
Five million dollars!

672
00:47:15,323 --> 00:47:18,427
Five m-m-million!

673
00:47:21,101 --> 00:47:23,478
Cash, lots of cash.

674
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:25,976
Whoa!

675
00:47:26,714 --> 00:47:30,011
Listen, the most amazing thing
has happened, Vincent.

676
00:47:30,072 --> 00:47:33,446
-You scared the living shit outta me.
-I met one of our fathers.

677
00:47:33,865 --> 00:47:35,553
He told me about a man in New Mexico...

678
00:47:35,621 --> 00:47:38,915
-who probably knows where mom is.
-Oh, great! Yes!

679
00:47:39,774 --> 00:47:42,068
-Listen, she didn't abandon you.
-No?

680
00:47:42,786 --> 00:47:44,915
You know what I mean?
She didn't abandon you.

681
00:47:44,976 --> 00:47:46,897
-She didn't even know you were born.
-Oh!

682
00:47:46,958 --> 00:47:49,773
-They told her that I died.
-No kidding?

683
00:47:50,044 --> 00:47:52,757
Look, Julius, I'm in a hurry.

684
00:47:53,195 --> 00:47:55,787
-You know Sammy, who gave me this car?
-Yeah.

685
00:47:56,663 --> 00:47:59,939
You remember Sammy? He wants me
to take this car to Houston.

686
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,059
-So I'm gonna be gone a couple of days.
-Houston?

687
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:07,143
Hous... Hou-no!
-You know something?

688
00:48:08,321 --> 00:48:10,471
New Mexico's on the way to Houston.

689
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:13,322
A lot of places are
on the way to Houston.

690
00:48:15,914 --> 00:48:18,643
Use the house, make some phone calls.

691
00:48:18,704 --> 00:48:21,445
Throw wild parties.
Take advantage of your brother.

692
00:48:21,506 --> 00:48:23,925
We have to see this man, Traven,
in new Mexico.

693
00:48:23,986 --> 00:48:26,193
No, we don't have to see
this man in new Mexico.

694
00:48:26,459 --> 00:48:27,366
Yes, we do!

695
00:48:27,526 --> 00:48:28,784
And I'm coming with you.

696
00:48:36,887 --> 00:48:37,894
We'll go see the man.

697
00:48:37,955 --> 00:48:41,167
-I take a shower. I get my bags.
-Get your bags.

698
00:48:41,228 --> 00:48:42,805
Be right out. Oh, boy!

699
00:48:43,674 --> 00:48:45,436
I'll be here, bro. Okay.

700
00:48:55,844 --> 00:48:56,958
This place is a zoo!

701
00:48:58,171 --> 00:48:58,894
Wait, wait.

702
00:49:03,364 --> 00:49:04,730
-Happy Birthday, Vince.
-Oh.

703
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:06,474
-Happy Birthday, Vince.
-God.

704
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:09,974
It's not my birthday any more.

705
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:12,270
Better late than never.

706
00:49:13,842 --> 00:49:15,254
Look what Marnie made for Julius.

707
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:18,716
-You baked?
-Yeah. Is Julius around?

708
00:49:19,245 --> 00:49:22,679
-He's taking a shower.
-I'll go give these to him.

709
00:49:24,234 --> 00:49:25,270
So-o-o!

710
00:49:25,331 --> 00:49:28,858
-Where'd you get this car?
-Sammy. You know Sammy.

711
00:49:30,502 --> 00:49:33,210
-Where you going?
-Inside. Have some coffee?

712
00:49:34,664 --> 00:49:37,025
You're going somewhere and you
weren't even gonna say goodbye.

713
00:49:37,238 --> 00:49:39,601
Take out your papers and your trash

714
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,160
or you don't get no spending cash

715
00:49:43,052 --> 00:49:45,285
if you don't scrub the kitchen floor

716
00:49:45,959 --> 00:49:48,174
you ain't gonna rock and roll no more

717
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:51,082
yakety-yak yakety-yak
don't talk back

718
00:49:51,418 --> 00:49:52,339
Marnie!

719
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,376
Excuse me, but I was
just taking a shower.

720
00:49:57,613 --> 00:49:58,549
Good singing.

721
00:49:59,604 --> 00:50:01,627
I baked you some cookies.

722
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:05,218
-Cookies?
-I guess it was a dumb idea.

723
00:50:05,279 --> 00:50:09,266
No, not at all. I'm really
looking forward to tossing them.

724
00:50:13,389 --> 00:50:16,314
-I should put on some clothes.
-I'm sorry, I'll turn around.

725
00:50:16,788 --> 00:50:19,249
Linda and I just came by
'cause she baked him a cake...

726
00:50:19,615 --> 00:50:22,452
-for his birthday.
-I had birthday, too.

727
00:50:22,882 --> 00:50:23,897
Oh, that's right.

728
00:50:26,187 --> 00:50:27,087
You're twins.

729
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:34,653
Huh?

730
00:50:35,224 --> 00:50:36,106
Whoa.

731
00:50:39,685 --> 00:50:40,438
What is it?

732
00:50:40,499 --> 00:50:43,297
I don't know what it is,
but it's worth a fortune.

733
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:46,341
-A fortune? That's great!
-Yeah!

734
00:50:47,404 --> 00:50:48,321
Excuse me!

735
00:50:50,356 --> 00:50:51,515
Excuse me.

736
00:50:51,576 --> 00:50:53,901
Never sleep with that man,
never loan him money...

737
00:50:53,962 --> 00:50:56,922
never believe a word he
tells you. That's free advice.

738
00:50:58,130 --> 00:50:59,235
Good morning, Agnes.

739
00:51:01,444 --> 00:51:02,130
Vince?

740
00:51:02,201 --> 00:51:05,414
I cleaned her pipes once.
Let's go have a cup of coffee.

741
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,699
Vincent, I'm comin' with you.

742
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,462
Linda, no, you're not coming with me.

743
00:51:11,523 --> 00:51:13,650
-Yes, I am.
-No, you're not coming.

744
00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:16,104
You could get killed and die and
I wouldn't know what happened.

745
00:51:17,477 --> 00:51:19,594
-No!
-You say 'no' one more time...

746
00:51:19,655 --> 00:51:23,367
-I'm gonna tell everybody that there's-
-Shut up! Shut up!

747
00:51:27,008 --> 00:51:29,719
All right. Oh, God.

748
00:51:31,314 --> 00:51:32,171
All right, you're coming.

749
00:51:32,232 --> 00:51:35,694
But you do not tell Julius
what's in that trunk.

750
00:51:37,210 --> 00:51:39,004
He thinks we're going
to look up our ancestors...

751
00:51:39,065 --> 00:51:41,148
like in 'Roots' or something.
All right?

752
00:51:41,669 --> 00:51:44,144
-Does this one look okay?
-It looks fine.

753
00:51:44,403 --> 00:51:46,468
It's good you didn't have
to borrow his pants.

754
00:51:47,932 --> 00:51:49,300
-Marnie...
-Linda, what?

755
00:51:49,361 --> 00:51:50,311
-Guess what?
-What?

756
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:53,729
Vince just asked us to go to
New Mexico and Texas with him.

757
00:51:54,451 --> 00:51:56,105
This is a great idea.

758
00:51:56,194 --> 00:51:58,355
Vincent, is this true?
We all go together?

759
00:51:58,416 --> 00:51:59,284
Yeah.

760
00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:03,318
I thought it was a great idea
if we all hopped in the car...

761
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:05,335
and spent a few days
on the road together.

762
00:52:06,666 --> 00:52:07,511
Nice shirt.

763
00:52:08,297 --> 00:52:12,136
-Feels great. It's all cotton.
-Well, it breathes.

764
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,562
It's okay. Come out.

765
00:52:17,558 --> 00:52:19,854
All right. Here, Linda.

766
00:52:20,209 --> 00:52:22,464
Oh, can I ride in front with Vincent?

767
00:52:23,415 --> 00:52:24,925
-Sure.
-Thanks.

768
00:52:42,713 --> 00:52:43,778
Now, let me see.

769
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:45,293
I'm supposed to be
giving you one of these.

770
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,363
Sorry, it's my first day on the job.

771
00:52:48,424 --> 00:52:49,516
Have a nice day.

772
00:52:53,993 --> 00:52:58,418
Now, where do I find
this very special person...

773
00:52:58,792 --> 00:53:00,828
Mr. Vince Benedict?

774
00:53:30,725 --> 00:53:31,909
Well, what have we here?

775
00:53:33,517 --> 00:53:35,253
What a cute little kitty.

776
00:53:36,529 --> 00:53:37,917
Where's daddy?

777
00:53:48,343 --> 00:53:51,697
Well, well, well.
Thank you very much.

778
00:53:51,947 --> 00:53:53,585
Open up, Vince.
We know you're in there.

779
00:53:53,646 --> 00:53:54,954
Come on, we just wanna talk to you.

780
00:53:57,475 --> 00:53:58,143
Howdy!

781
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:05,504
Who are you?

782
00:54:05,888 --> 00:54:07,396
It's not really important, is it?

783
00:54:07,457 --> 00:54:09,500
I was just feeding the cat,
then I was gonna leave.

784
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:11,002
I asked you a question.

785
00:54:12,114 --> 00:54:14,437
-Well, who are you?
-We're the Klane brothers.

786
00:54:15,329 --> 00:54:17,268
That's Burt, this is
Morris, and I'm Bob.

787
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:21,056
-Interesting gene pool.
-Don't cast dispersions at my family.

788
00:54:21,117 --> 00:54:24,479
I beg your pardon. But you're
looking for Vince Benedict.

789
00:54:25,174 --> 00:54:26,979
-Right.
-Am I Vince Benedict?

790
00:54:28,761 --> 00:54:30,269
So what difference
does it make who I am?

791
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,100
-Hit him, Bobby.
-Yeah.

792
00:54:33,676 --> 00:54:35,419
Hey! All right.

793
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:37,893
Your brothers seem to have
a problem with their feet.

794
00:54:38,187 --> 00:54:41,631
-Could be contagious. Bye, bye.
-Ow! Ow!

795
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:46,686
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

796
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:51,993
-You want a doctor?
-Ow!

797
00:54:52,331 --> 00:54:53,680
I'll call a doctor.

798
00:55:43,062 --> 00:55:46,159
Sorry I tore your shirt.
I don't know what happened.

799
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:46,965
It's all right.

800
00:55:49,399 --> 00:55:50,758
-Julius!
-What?

801
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:54,197
-Are you allergic to something?
-No.

802
00:55:54,634 --> 00:55:56,918
Then why are these bumps
all over your body?

803
00:55:57,257 --> 00:56:00,551
You're all swelled up.
You look like you're ready to explode.

804
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,601
Put this shirt on. There are
women and children present.

805
00:56:04,526 --> 00:56:06,842
And your back,
it's worse than the front.

806
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:11,714
-It's like North Dakota.
-You're so funny, Vincent.

807
00:56:13,434 --> 00:56:15,830
This is for the T-shirt
and the sandwiches.

808
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:22,183
-Born to be bad.
-Yes, we are.

809
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:24,295
Ooh, you're so scary.

810
00:56:25,653 --> 00:56:26,347
Linda.

811
00:56:27,042 --> 00:56:27,869
Linda!

812
00:56:30,502 --> 00:56:31,931
Well, what do you think?

813
00:56:33,831 --> 00:56:36,850
-Let's rock and roll.
-It's his first T-shirt.

814
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:57,346
-Honey, honey.
-Yeah?

815
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:00,352
See if you can get us
a room with a king-size bed?

816
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,780
Right.

817
00:57:02,281 --> 00:57:04,248
We'll get us settled.
We'll meet you here.

818
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:05,700
-Okay.
-Goodbye.

819
00:57:07,915 --> 00:57:10,727
I don't need a king-size bed.
I always sleep on the floor.

820
00:57:13,942 --> 00:57:17,039
Uh, I don't know, Jules.
I hope this is a good idea.

821
00:57:18,885 --> 00:57:19,637
Come on.

822
00:57:22,316 --> 00:57:23,751
Now, look, promise me something.

823
00:57:25,005 --> 00:57:27,436
If this Professor Traven
has never heard of...

824
00:57:27,823 --> 00:57:30,258
you know, mom or us twins...

825
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,155
or all our dads or the experiment...

826
00:57:33,453 --> 00:57:34,807
you won't be upset.

827
00:57:35,278 --> 00:57:37,805
All I want him to do
is tell us the truth.

828
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:41,272
I don't know who you are
and what you're talking about.

829
00:57:41,333 --> 00:57:43,297
Get the hell out of here
before I call security.

830
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,914
Well, that's that.
On to Houston.

831
00:57:50,463 --> 00:57:51,683
He's lying!

832
00:57:52,245 --> 00:57:53,848
Take it easy. He said he
was gonna call security.

833
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:57,198
For the first time in my life,
I'm pissed off!

834
00:57:57,834 --> 00:58:00,046
Julius, don't do this to me.
I got a car to deliver.

835
00:58:00,107 --> 00:58:02,028
The last thing I need is
a detour in the slammer.

836
00:58:02,089 --> 00:58:04,504
-I'm gonna make him tell us the truth.
-No!

837
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:10,570
That's our mother.
Those are our six fathers.

838
00:58:10,768 --> 00:58:13,846
That's Werner. And that is you.

839
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,517
So start talking.

840
00:58:17,097 --> 00:58:18,770
Everything okay, Dr Traven?

841
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:23,661
Um, yes. It's okay.

842
00:58:24,187 --> 00:58:25,135
I'll take care of it.

843
00:58:31,433 --> 00:58:32,590
Well, Vincent...

844
00:58:34,726 --> 00:58:36,699
you turned out just like
I thought you would.

845
00:58:36,974 --> 00:58:38,603
What did you do, escape from prison?

846
00:58:43,075 --> 00:58:44,120
How'd you know my name?

847
00:58:48,326 --> 00:58:49,556
I named you.

848
00:59:04,077 --> 00:59:07,188
We sealed this door
the day after you were born.

849
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:26,050
Well, come on in.
This is what you wanted to see.

850
00:59:42,539 --> 00:59:44,345
You came out first, of course.

851
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,939
We weren't expecting... him.

852
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:53,393
This, uh...

853
00:59:53,604 --> 00:59:55,939
must be where you made the milk shake.

854
00:59:56,037 --> 00:59:57,740
We weren't making milk shakes.

855
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:02,208
We were making the most fully-developed
human the world has ever seen.

856
01:00:04,127 --> 01:00:06,381
But instead of just one perfect kid...

857
01:00:06,797 --> 01:00:10,904
-mom had the two of us. Way to go, mom!
-Wrong!

858
01:00:11,134 --> 01:00:13,641
The embryo did split in two, but...

859
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:15,958
It didn't split equally.

860
01:00:16,758 --> 01:00:19,641
All the purity and
strength went into Julius.

861
01:00:21,251 --> 01:00:23,235
All the crap that was left over...

862
01:00:23,296 --> 01:00:25,504
went into what you see
in the mirror every morning.

863
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,000
Whoa. You telling me
I'm the crap?

864
01:00:28,618 --> 01:00:30,307
-This is not true.
-Wait, Julius. I wanna hear this.

865
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:35,092
You're telling me that I am
the leftover crap? I'm no good?

866
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:36,690
-He's wrong.
-Look at him.

867
01:00:40,591 --> 01:00:41,575
Are you saying that...

868
01:00:43,555 --> 01:00:44,761
I'm a side effect?

869
01:00:45,446 --> 01:00:48,333
You haven't got the brain power
to understand this...

870
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,394
and I haven't got the time.
Show's over.

871
01:00:54,179 --> 01:00:56,681
Hey, dick head.

872
01:00:57,732 --> 01:00:59,273
Tell us where our mother is.

873
01:00:59,843 --> 01:01:02,590
Um... Whispering Pines.

874
01:01:03,001 --> 01:01:05,839
It's an artists' colony
200 miles north of Santa Fe.

875
01:01:10,823 --> 01:01:11,857
If you're lying to me,

876
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,364
I'll be back.

877
01:01:26,891 --> 01:01:27,924
Come on.

878
01:01:43,146 --> 01:01:45,364
My life just got
flushed down the toilet.

879
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,563
No, Vincent. Your life
is just about to begin.

880
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:53,572
I'm genetic garbage.

881
01:01:54,153 --> 01:01:57,121
We're twins.
We're basically the same.

882
01:01:58,967 --> 01:02:02,277
Julius, I know this is
a touchy subject for you...

883
01:02:02,338 --> 01:02:04,936
but we don't look the same,
we don't act the same...

884
01:02:04,997 --> 01:02:06,711
we don't talk the same,
we don't dress the same.

885
01:02:06,802 --> 01:02:07,782
I know.

886
01:02:07,843 --> 01:02:11,464
So if we're so much the same,
how come we're so different?

887
01:02:12,109 --> 01:02:13,414
We had six fathers.

888
01:02:14,222 --> 01:02:16,598
We're different parts of
a lot of different people.

889
01:02:18,732 --> 01:02:19,398
Yeah?

890
01:02:19,962 --> 01:02:23,423
Don't forget. I was taken
to a beautiful island.

891
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:26,602
I was loved. I was
protected, educated.

892
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,336
You had nobody, Vincent.

893
01:02:30,031 --> 01:02:33,562
Nobody to love you,
to trust you, to encourage you.

894
01:02:33,951 --> 01:02:36,895
All life taught you was
that the only person you...

895
01:02:36,956 --> 01:02:38,687
could count on was yourself.

896
01:02:48,092 --> 01:02:48,957
You see, Vincent...

897
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:51,392
you're the missing part of my life.

898
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:55,389
And I'm the missing part of your life.

899
01:02:56,027 --> 01:02:57,529
When we find mama...

900
01:02:58,455 --> 01:03:00,301
We can fill the missing part of hers.

901
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:05,099
We won't be alone any more.

902
01:03:08,386 --> 01:03:10,411
We can be a family.

903
01:03:17,244 --> 01:03:18,177
A family?

904
01:03:19,002 --> 01:03:19,690
Yes.

905
01:03:22,814 --> 01:03:24,938
You mean, like,
with a Christmas tree...

906
01:03:25,781 --> 01:03:27,457
and Thanksgiving dinner?

907
01:03:28,033 --> 01:03:29,209
And a real home...

908
01:03:29,881 --> 01:03:31,428
where you'll always be welcome.

909
01:03:34,229 --> 01:03:35,145
Always?

910
01:03:38,096 --> 01:03:39,510
Even when you've been bad.

911
01:03:48,291 --> 01:03:49,758
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

912
01:03:49,877 --> 01:03:51,239
Yeah, yeah, ooh.

913
01:03:51,509 --> 01:03:54,969
Yes, um-mm. Oh, look.

914
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:58,200
-Is this really necessary?
-Yes, of course it's necessary.

915
01:03:58,496 --> 01:04:01,958
I'm not going to introduce you to my mother
looking like a goat herder from Albania.

916
01:04:02,235 --> 01:04:03,651
You need clothes.

917
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,894
-But I feel fine the way I am.
-But you look like a-

918
01:04:06,955 --> 01:04:10,250
-Hello, can I help you?
-Do I look like I need help?

919
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:12,952
Here's the problem.
We gotta do a whole ensemble.

920
01:04:24,091 --> 01:04:28,305
-Do I look okay?
-You look better. Let's put it that way.

921
01:04:28,945 --> 01:04:30,269
You know what we have to do, Jules?

922
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:32,325
We gotta work on the way
you're walking, a little bit.

923
01:04:32,435 --> 01:04:36,031
You look a little stiff.
You ever see 'Frankenstein'?

924
01:04:36,511 --> 01:04:38,873
-I read the book.
-That's not gonna help.

925
01:04:39,926 --> 01:04:43,101
When you walk, you gotta walk
like you're moving to music...

926
01:04:43,491 --> 01:04:45,347
and I don't mean a military march.

927
01:04:45,408 --> 01:04:48,486
Like, you know, Aretha Franklin
and Otis Redding...

928
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:50,927
and Wilson Pickett,
a couple of white people.

929
01:04:50,988 --> 01:04:53,366
-Like this?
-Yeah. Bop! That's it.

930
01:04:53,427 --> 01:04:56,112
-Yeah, loose!
-Oh, I like that.

931
01:04:56,943 --> 01:04:59,670
I got something for you.
Try these on.

932
01:04:59,731 --> 01:05:01,813
-Sunglasses?
-Yeah, here you go.

933
01:05:05,422 --> 01:05:08,342
Now, that's it. There. Yeah!

934
01:05:08,403 --> 01:05:10,527
That's it. Yeah!

935
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,130
-Whoops!
-Whoa!

936
01:05:14,464 --> 01:05:17,583
-Do I look cool now?
-Mr. Ice.

937
01:05:18,052 --> 01:05:20,984
Yeah, just breeze
on through. Yeah!

938
01:05:22,631 --> 01:05:23,378
Tonight

939
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,218
Tonight's the night

940
01:05:26,497 --> 01:05:28,875
It's gonna be a good night, bro

941
01:05:28,936 --> 01:05:31,772
And everything's gonna happen, bro

942
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:33,920
And you take her in your arms

943
01:05:34,023 --> 01:05:37,020
And you plant a good
one on her... ho

944
01:05:37,385 --> 01:05:38,588
Tonight's the night

945
01:05:38,649 --> 01:05:40,865
Tonight, tonight, tonight

946
01:05:40,926 --> 01:05:42,463
Tonight is your night, bro

947
01:05:48,179 --> 01:05:50,113
Yeah, it's your night, bro!

948
01:05:50,229 --> 01:05:52,578
Oh yeah, bro you're gonna do it

949
01:05:52,858 --> 01:05:54,092
you're gonna cut it

950
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,788
You're making me nervous!

951
01:05:57,355 --> 01:05:58,622
-Well, you're nervous.
-You've got to help me.

952
01:05:58,974 --> 01:06:01,707
-What?
-I've never been out on a date before.

953
01:06:01,768 --> 01:06:03,154
-That's okay.
-I don't know what to do.

954
01:06:03,863 --> 01:06:06,495
Well, you talk to her.
You buy her a couple of drinks.

955
01:06:06,886 --> 01:06:08,763
You dance with her, bro

956
01:06:09,126 --> 01:06:10,623
You gonna dance with

957
01:06:13,239 --> 01:06:14,381
You dance?

958
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,420
Oh, you probably never
did that before, either.

959
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:23,055
No.

960
01:06:23,363 --> 01:06:24,447
Oh, well, look.

961
01:06:25,265 --> 01:06:25,877
All right.

962
01:06:28,431 --> 01:06:29,821
The first thing is, Jules...

963
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,187
forget about disco.

964
01:06:33,066 --> 01:06:35,464
-Right? No disco.
-No disco.

965
01:06:35,937 --> 01:06:38,794
When I really wanna romance a girl...

966
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:40,950
I waltz with her.

967
01:06:42,126 --> 01:06:44,916
Rah-tah-tah rah-tah-tah

968
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:47,473
-You mean, like Strauss?
-Yeah.

969
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:50,332
It turns 'em into putty in your hands.

970
01:06:57,049 --> 01:06:59,140
Come on, let's assume
the dance position.

971
01:06:59,694 --> 01:07:01,572
I'll give you a couple of pointers.

972
01:07:02,001 --> 01:07:03,727
-I really appreciate that.
-Come on. Let's go.

973
01:07:04,468 --> 01:07:06,223
I hope nobody's looking in the window.

974
01:07:06,342 --> 01:07:07,746
Come on, like this. Here you go.

975
01:07:07,807 --> 01:07:10,359
Put your feet by my feet.
Come on. Let's go.

976
01:07:15,016 --> 01:07:16,104
By my feet...

977
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:18,242
Not on my feet.
Thanks very much.

978
01:07:18,709 --> 01:07:20,682
-Sorry, Vincent.
-Minor oversight.

979
01:07:21,534 --> 01:07:22,766
Grab my hand. Come on.

980
01:07:23,577 --> 01:07:26,216
Yeow! Ah! Ease up!

981
01:07:26,681 --> 01:07:29,731
Tiny bit. Let the blood
flow through the fingers.

982
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:30,616
Oh, like loose?

983
01:07:30,677 --> 01:07:32,971
-See, come on. That's it, relax.
-I'm just nervous.

984
01:07:33,032 --> 01:07:36,327
Okay, one, two, three.
One, two, three.

985
01:07:36,492 --> 01:07:38,912
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

986
01:07:39,103 --> 01:07:40,308
-One, two, three.
-Don't, no.

987
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:42,405
-One, two, three.
-See what you're doing with your teeth?

988
01:07:42,552 --> 01:07:45,380
You're grinding them.
Don't grind your teeth.

989
01:07:45,998 --> 01:07:47,518
Don't grind your teeth.

990
01:07:48,636 --> 01:07:50,175
Relax your jaws, yeah.

991
01:07:51,281 --> 01:07:55,077
Now try to count without
moving your lips, all right?

992
01:07:55,232 --> 01:07:58,249
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

993
01:07:58,369 --> 01:08:01,232
See? That's it.
You're not wrestling a boar...

994
01:08:01,508 --> 01:08:04,621
300 Miles South, southwest of Fiji.

995
01:08:41,486 --> 01:08:44,531
Good, Jules.

996
01:09:15,396 --> 01:09:16,250
Yeah!

997
01:09:45,928 --> 01:09:47,622
Way to go, Jules!

998
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:54,771
Did you know they had beer
in ancient Egypt?

999
01:09:54,986 --> 01:09:56,233
-Oh, yeah?
-No.

1000
01:09:56,533 --> 01:09:59,882
It was actually the Assyrians
that developed the beer.

1001
01:10:00,104 --> 01:10:02,366
And it was the Egyptians
who were the first people

1002
01:10:02,427 --> 01:10:04,371
to perfect the malt
fermentation process.

1003
01:10:05,115 --> 01:10:08,209
-You know a lot about beer.
-He knows about everything.

1004
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:12,196
It's all from books.
Until tonight, I've never had a beer.

1005
01:10:13,833 --> 01:10:17,360
All theory, no practise.
The story of my life.

1006
01:10:17,770 --> 01:10:21,546
-Awww!
-We're gonna change all that.

1007
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:23,171
Aren't we, Marnie?

1008
01:10:25,439 --> 01:10:26,770
-Marnie.
-What?

1009
01:10:28,559 --> 01:10:29,966
Am I shit-faced yet?

1010
01:10:33,588 --> 01:10:36,933
Excuse me, but...
my back teeth are floating.

1011
01:10:38,930 --> 01:10:41,758
Excuse me, I have to check if
my back teeth are floating.

1012
01:10:43,361 --> 01:10:44,622
Good shot.

1013
01:10:49,335 --> 01:10:50,732
Woo-hoo! Ooo!

1014
01:10:53,311 --> 01:10:57,593
Oh, God. We both flushed at
the same time before we did it.

1015
01:10:59,704 --> 01:11:02,113
Yeah, right. Woo-hoo!

1016
01:11:03,116 --> 01:11:06,160
Hey, Jules. Marnie's
got the hots for you, babe.

1017
01:11:06,319 --> 01:11:08,261
Tonight is your lucky night.
I know it.

1018
01:11:08,395 --> 01:11:12,399
-I don't think Marnie likes me.
-You kidding? Piece of cake.

1019
01:11:12,524 --> 01:11:15,503
This woman is ripe.
You're nervous...

1020
01:11:15,611 --> 01:11:17,989
because it's your first time.
Perfectly natural.

1021
01:11:20,188 --> 01:11:20,840
Really.

1022
01:11:25,704 --> 01:11:27,537
Were you nervous the first time?

1023
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:34,402
I was 12 years old and she was
a nun. Talk about pressure.

1024
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,944
Whoa!

1025
01:11:38,545 --> 01:11:39,765
Come on, hit 'em.

1026
01:11:39,826 --> 01:11:41,187
-What?
-Hit 'em, hit 'em.

1027
01:11:41,248 --> 01:11:43,607
Oh, hit 'em, hit 'em.

1028
01:11:45,675 --> 01:11:46,393
Julius...

1029
01:11:48,632 --> 01:11:49,480
you know...

1030
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:52,372
Julius, I have to admit this.

1031
01:11:53,849 --> 01:11:57,435
Since you and I first met, uh...

1032
01:11:57,496 --> 01:11:59,682
my life has been just
getting better and better.

1033
01:12:01,218 --> 01:12:02,243
Mine, too.

1034
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:05,054
I'm so happy, Vincent.

1035
01:12:05,222 --> 01:12:07,067
I feel like sometimes, like...

1036
01:12:07,503 --> 01:12:10,352
-picking you up and hug you...
-Whoa!

1037
01:12:10,413 --> 01:12:11,906
and hug you, hug you, hug you.

1038
01:12:15,698 --> 01:12:17,092
Hey, he's my brother.

1039
01:12:18,392 --> 01:12:20,697
Oh, lay off the beer, Julius.

1040
01:12:30,985 --> 01:12:33,146
Did you tell anyone
we were coming to Santa Fe?

1041
01:12:33,749 --> 01:12:36,543
I called work and told them
we wouldn't be in for a few days.

1042
01:12:38,752 --> 01:12:40,880
Oh, I forgot to tell you we were fired.

1043
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,212
-Oh, no.
-You hated that job.

1044
01:12:44,362 --> 01:12:46,068
Nice of your boss to tell
us where we could find you.

1045
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:47,264
Oh, no.

1046
01:12:47,904 --> 01:12:52,722
Hi, girls, you don't mind if
we join you and listen to some music.

1047
01:12:55,654 --> 01:12:59,257
The Klane boys.
What an unpleasant surprise.

1048
01:12:59,509 --> 01:13:02,882
Vince, this has gone way beyond...

1049
01:13:02,995 --> 01:13:06,374
-a case of simple loan delinquency.
-We don't like being shot.

1050
01:13:06,765 --> 01:13:08,584
Shot? Who shot you?

1051
01:13:09,649 --> 01:13:12,046
-What do you want?
-We want to take Vince...

1052
01:13:12,232 --> 01:13:16,290
-out to the parking lot and kill him.
-Ohhh, owww!

1053
01:13:17,104 --> 01:13:18,842
Don't you think
that's a little drastic?

1054
01:13:19,398 --> 01:13:20,262
Let's go.

1055
01:13:22,143 --> 01:13:23,136
Don't touch him.

1056
01:13:25,105 --> 01:13:25,878
Ohhh!

1057
01:13:26,424 --> 01:13:28,162
Hey, big fella.

1058
01:13:29,398 --> 01:13:31,626
You wouldn't want me to hurt
the lovely lady, would you?

1059
01:13:33,766 --> 01:13:34,726
You moved too soon.

1060
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:36,570
-What?

1061
01:13:37,835 --> 01:13:39,905
-The second rule in a crisis situation...

1062
01:13:39,966 --> 01:13:43,348
Uh-oh. He's startin'
that funny talk, again.

1063
01:13:44,310 --> 01:13:45,496
If you choose to bluff...

1064
01:13:46,294 --> 01:13:48,296
you must be prepared
to have your bluff called.

1065
01:13:48,934 --> 01:13:50,304
This is no bluff.

1066
01:13:51,519 --> 01:13:54,145
These are my cousins, Sam and Dave.

1067
01:13:54,206 --> 01:13:56,278
Get these jerks outta here.

1068
01:14:11,256 --> 01:14:14,622
I'm so proud of you.
I love when you hit people.

1069
01:14:16,503 --> 01:14:18,225
You got a lot of rules, Jules.

1070
01:14:28,925 --> 01:14:29,957
What a day.

1071
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:33,563
First we visited our birthplace...

1072
01:14:34,507 --> 01:14:36,054
then we bought new clothes.

1073
01:14:36,115 --> 01:14:39,270
I got a bucket of ice and
a very good bottle of wine.

1074
01:14:39,331 --> 01:14:42,733
-Then we danced the waltz.
-Yes, we did.

1075
01:14:42,907 --> 01:14:45,896
-It's too bright.
-Then we got into a fight.

1076
01:14:46,115 --> 01:14:49,038
-We have this beautiful room.
-Perfect. Yes, it is beautiful.

1077
01:14:49,871 --> 01:14:51,803
Life just doesn't get better than this.

1078
01:14:53,078 --> 01:14:56,588
-Oh, yes, it does. Good night.
-Where are you going?

1079
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:59,830
I'm gonna go tuck Linda in
and maybe read her a bedtime story.

1080
01:15:00,379 --> 01:15:01,583
Don't wait up for me.

1081
01:15:05,157 --> 01:15:08,881
Tonight is your night, bro

1082
01:15:08,993 --> 01:15:10,954
It's your night, bro

1083
01:15:14,962 --> 01:15:17,238
Oh, Vincent, you locked yourself out.

1084
01:15:17,469 --> 01:15:20,530
-I-Marnie.
-Hi.

1085
01:15:21,179 --> 01:15:23,293
-Hi.
-Vince and Linda wanna be alone...

1086
01:15:23,354 --> 01:15:25,550
so I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to stay here tonight.

1087
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:29,934
You mean you're gonna sleep here tonight?
Uhhuh.

1088
01:15:31,694 --> 01:15:32,904
Which bed should I take?

1089
01:15:37,090 --> 01:15:38,610
Either bed will be fine.

1090
01:15:38,671 --> 01:15:40,163
I always sleep on the floo-

1091
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:52,509
-Good night.
-Good night.

1092
01:16:08,928 --> 01:16:09,828
Julius.

1093
01:16:14,394 --> 01:16:16,551
-Good night.
-Good night.

1094
01:16:33,654 --> 01:16:36,218
-Oh, no.
-What?

1095
01:16:38,658 --> 01:16:41,243
-What's the matter?
-This bed is lumpy.

1096
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:48,668
You mind if I share the floor with you?

1097
01:17:19,829 --> 01:17:21,239
You're teasing me, aren't you?

1098
01:17:22,727 --> 01:17:23,406
A little.

1099
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:29,748
What do I do now?

1100
01:17:33,673 --> 01:17:34,847
We'll figure it out.

1101
01:17:38,661 --> 01:17:41,706
-Oh, Vince.
-Tonight is our night, bro

1102
01:17:42,030 --> 01:17:43,877
Why are you doing that now?

1103
01:17:44,672 --> 01:17:46,658
Mom hasn't seen me in all these years.

1104
01:17:46,957 --> 01:17:48,248
I wanna look my best.

1105
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:52,286
Tonight -your mom's gonna
love you whatever you look like.

1106
01:17:52,628 --> 01:17:54,504
And you look really good.

1107
01:17:54,699 --> 01:17:56,676
I know, I know, I know, I know.

1108
01:17:56,887 --> 01:18:00,053
So like this. One, two, three.

1109
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:02,277
Are you a little nervous?

1110
01:18:03,289 --> 01:18:05,053
27, 28, no, 29.

1111
01:18:05,114 --> 01:18:06,085
-Just a little.
-Nine, ten.

1112
01:18:08,030 --> 01:18:09,606
-Linda.
-What?

1113
01:18:09,667 --> 01:18:12,137
Like, what if she's disappointed in me?

1114
01:18:13,647 --> 01:18:16,194
If she's disappointed,
then she's a fake.

1115
01:18:16,694 --> 01:18:19,197
I don't know what else
a mom could want in a son.

1116
01:18:19,644 --> 01:18:22,564
-Huh?
-You're right.

1117
01:18:23,056 --> 01:18:25,696
You're right, you're right.
Why am I worried?

1118
01:18:26,053 --> 01:18:27,930
-What am I worried about?
-I don't know.

1119
01:18:28,548 --> 01:18:29,609
You got it all.

1120
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,167
-I couldn't do this without you, Linda.
-Yeah.

1121
01:18:35,776 --> 01:18:38,110
You know, I've been thinking...

1122
01:18:38,592 --> 01:18:40,518
-that when we get back...
-Yeah?

1123
01:18:42,179 --> 01:18:43,900
I think we should move in together.

1124
01:18:44,977 --> 01:18:46,564
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1125
01:18:46,625 --> 01:18:48,962
-Oh, no, no.
-It's not 'oh, no.'

1126
01:18:49,023 --> 01:18:51,088
-It's not no, no, no, no, no.
-No, no, no, no, no, no.

1127
01:18:51,149 --> 01:18:53,387
I don't want to get married
and it's not that I wanna...

1128
01:18:53,448 --> 01:18:55,578
keep track of you,
because I don't need to.

1129
01:18:57,614 --> 01:18:59,343
I just wanna live with you.

1130
01:18:59,680 --> 01:19:02,021
It'd be fun.

1131
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,667
Linda, look at me.

1132
01:19:04,934 --> 01:19:06,936
Do I look like somebody
who could play house?

1133
01:19:07,207 --> 01:19:10,386
I'm cranky in the morning,
I'm grouchy in the afternoon...

1134
01:19:10,474 --> 01:19:13,176
I'm moody at night, I'm like miserable.

1135
01:19:13,435 --> 01:19:14,643
I know what you're like.

1136
01:19:17,104 --> 01:19:19,570
Let's sleep on it, okay?
Sleep on it.

1137
01:19:19,631 --> 01:19:22,050
-Okay, one night.
-This is going to be great.

1138
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:25,823
Tomorrow I'm taking my best girl
to meet my mom. I'm so excited.

1139
01:19:25,884 --> 01:19:29,290
-Your best girl?
-Yeah, you, you.

1140
01:19:29,638 --> 01:19:31,883
Linda, there's no other girls.
Not any more.

1141
01:19:32,543 --> 01:19:33,128
Yeah?

1142
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:36,833
-Just you.
-There better not be. Know why?

1143
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:42,150
-Why?
-'Cause I only have eyes for you

1144
01:19:47,105 --> 01:19:48,867
-That sounds familiar.
-It's a good song.

1145
01:19:48,928 --> 01:19:50,240
You like that song, huh?

1146
01:20:36,591 --> 01:20:38,337
Oh, it's huge.

1147
01:20:38,398 --> 01:20:39,856
Oh, it's beautiful.

1148
01:20:40,246 --> 01:20:41,970
Not to mention valuable.

1149
01:20:42,476 --> 01:20:44,853
Real estate like this
is worth a fortune.

1150
01:20:45,076 --> 01:20:46,875
You mustn't always think about money.

1151
01:20:47,231 --> 01:20:48,866
You got me all wrong, Julius.

1152
01:20:50,701 --> 01:20:53,662
I'm just saying it's nice mom's loaded.

1153
01:20:53,845 --> 01:20:56,399
That's a worry she won't
have to have in her old age.

1154
01:20:57,632 --> 01:20:59,395
Hello, can I help you?

1155
01:20:59,456 --> 01:21:02,125
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Oh, um, excuse me.

1156
01:21:02,186 --> 01:21:04,108
We are looking for
Mary Ann Benedict, please.

1157
01:21:04,305 --> 01:21:05,826
I'm sorry, but that's not possible.

1158
01:21:05,978 --> 01:21:08,661
Look, we've come a long way.

1159
01:21:09,041 --> 01:21:12,489
And believe me, she's gonna
be very happy to see us.

1160
01:21:12,676 --> 01:21:16,772
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to write to the
Benedict foundation stating your business.

1161
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:19,117
I'm sorry. Good day.

1162
01:21:24,617 --> 01:21:28,378
-Foundation?
-Millions, Julius.

1163
01:21:28,803 --> 01:21:30,859
Mama's rich.
We gotta go see her.

1164
01:21:31,012 --> 01:21:32,167
Buckaroos.

1165
01:21:32,251 --> 01:21:34,515
-Let's get in there. We gotta talk to her.
-We sneak in.

1166
01:21:34,576 --> 01:21:37,357
-How is it?
-Yeah, it's clear. Throw me over.

1167
01:21:37,418 --> 01:21:38,131
Okay.

1168
01:21:42,303 --> 01:21:44,818
Vince? Vince, are you okay?

1169
01:21:45,173 --> 01:21:46,682
Yeah, shut up. Come on, come on.

1170
01:22:11,837 --> 01:22:13,085
What a lovely day.

1171
01:22:17,585 --> 01:22:21,385
Hey, Vincent, don't you
think this is mama?

1172
01:22:22,923 --> 01:22:24,507
It could be. Yeah.

1173
01:22:26,771 --> 01:22:28,850
Don't just stand there.
Go introduce yourselves.

1174
01:22:29,651 --> 01:22:30,271
Hey!

1175
01:22:31,967 --> 01:22:34,107
-Should you people be here?
-Uh-oh.

1176
01:22:34,592 --> 01:22:37,590
That depends on how you feel
personally about trespassing.

1177
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:40,528
Does he always try
to be funny like that?

1178
01:22:42,001 --> 01:22:44,869
-We're looking for miss Mary Ann Benedict.
-Yeah.

1179
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,016
Is she here?

1180
01:22:47,103 --> 01:22:48,370
Yeah, she's here.

1181
01:22:49,065 --> 01:22:50,398
She's here!

1182
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:52,954
Sneaking in like that,
I should call the police.

1183
01:22:53,331 --> 01:22:56,074
No, no, no. You don't want
to do anything like that.

1184
01:22:56,255 --> 01:22:59,728
This is not your everyday,
average situation.

1185
01:23:09,155 --> 01:23:10,824
She's our mother, is the thing.

1186
01:23:10,997 --> 01:23:13,421
-We're her sons.
-Twin sons.

1187
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:18,863
You're comedians.

1188
01:23:19,403 --> 01:23:23,480
No. -No. We-we're
kind of a surprise.

1189
01:23:24,133 --> 01:23:25,149
I'll bet you are.

1190
01:23:27,149 --> 01:23:28,109
Follow me.

1191
01:23:33,788 --> 01:23:36,207
-We were right.
-It is her.

1192
01:23:44,673 --> 01:23:45,613
Excuse me.

1193
01:23:46,854 --> 01:23:49,410
-We thought that this is-
-Mary Ann Benedict?

1194
01:23:50,047 --> 01:23:52,648
This is an artists' colony.
There are a lot of painters.

1195
01:23:53,417 --> 01:23:54,104
Come on.

1196
01:23:58,616 --> 01:24:00,208
I can't wait to meet her.

1197
01:24:00,269 --> 01:24:01,848
-Yeah.
-It's gotta be amazing.

1198
01:24:02,351 --> 01:24:05,745
Look. Mary Ann Benedict
never understood...

1199
01:24:05,806 --> 01:24:07,730
why people wanted to buy her paintings.

1200
01:24:08,456 --> 01:24:10,862
But for a brief period,
they were considered valuable.

1201
01:24:11,277 --> 01:24:13,639
She used the money
to buy Whispering Pines.

1202
01:24:16,629 --> 01:24:18,320
May I ask you a question?

1203
01:24:18,915 --> 01:24:21,583
Why do you keep referring
to her in the past tense?

1204
01:24:22,497 --> 01:24:23,608
Because...

1205
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:28,115
she passed away some time ago.

1206
01:24:30,373 --> 01:24:31,606
She passed-

1207
01:24:33,699 --> 01:24:35,787
you jus-you just said
she was here.

1208
01:24:36,767 --> 01:24:40,364
I meant, her spirit.
Her spirit is always here.

1209
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:45,720
Come on.

1210
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:12,162
Can we get the hell
out of here, please?

1211
01:25:17,843 --> 01:25:19,489
Those damn real estate developers!

1212
01:25:19,771 --> 01:25:22,672
They won't be happy until
they turn this into a golf course.

1213
01:25:23,158 --> 01:25:24,918
Oh, is that who they were?

1214
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,059
They're shameless.
They'll try anything.

1215
01:25:30,429 --> 01:25:34,190
Do you know those men claim
to be my twin sons?

1216
01:25:34,251 --> 01:25:35,886
-If you can believe that!
-What?

1217
01:25:36,589 --> 01:25:38,013
It was really quite upsetting.

1218
01:25:39,198 --> 01:25:40,863
Mary Ann, I am sorry.

1219
01:25:41,687 --> 01:25:43,474
It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

1220
01:25:43,655 --> 01:25:44,679
You get over things.

1221
01:25:48,463 --> 01:25:49,786
I did have a child once.

1222
01:25:51,145 --> 01:25:52,522
But he died at birth.

1223
01:25:59,611 --> 01:26:02,364
You should be proud of her.

1224
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:04,240
She donates her house, land...

1225
01:26:04,301 --> 01:26:06,451
and all her paintings to young artists.

1226
01:26:07,669 --> 01:26:10,812
Linda, do I look like a
young artist to you?

1227
01:26:11,206 --> 01:26:13,872
-Vince, all she meant...
-I know what she meant...

1228
01:26:14,174 --> 01:26:15,264
and I know why she's here.

1229
01:26:15,325 --> 01:26:16,988
It's got nothing to do
with finding my mother...

1230
01:26:17,049 --> 01:26:18,573
and everything to do with money.

1231
01:26:19,113 --> 01:26:22,342
-That's not true and you know it.
-Bullshit!

1232
01:26:22,638 --> 01:26:25,631
Take it easy, Vincent.
This is not her fault.

1233
01:26:26,361 --> 01:26:28,223
Look who decided to chime in!

1234
01:26:28,359 --> 01:26:30,319
The creature from the black lagoon.

1235
01:26:30,463 --> 01:26:33,210
I should've had my head examined
listening to you in the first place.

1236
01:26:33,496 --> 01:26:35,338
A deal-of-a-lifetime
opportunity...

1237
01:26:35,399 --> 01:26:37,352
and I'm out looking for a dead mother.

1238
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:39,752
All I wanted was to
make us into a family.

1239
01:26:39,899 --> 01:26:41,471
Family, my butt!

1240
01:26:41,532 --> 01:26:42,827
There's no family here.

1241
01:26:42,888 --> 01:26:45,724
There's nothin' here
except me and three losers.

1242
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:47,423
I don't know why I listen to people.

1243
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:49,708
All my life, I'm always listening to people

1244
01:26:49,769 --> 01:26:50,840
-I don't know why I do it.
-Cut it out.

1245
01:26:50,965 --> 01:26:51,512
Vince!

1246
01:26:52,749 --> 01:26:53,646
I'm leaving.

1247
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:55,701
Stop! Please Vince!

1248
01:26:55,765 --> 01:26:59,015
Stop! You're acting
like a fourth-grader.

1249
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:00,825
Where do you think you're going?

1250
01:27:02,896 --> 01:27:05,357
He dumped us in
the middle of New Mexico.

1251
01:27:06,349 --> 01:27:07,070
I can't-

1252
01:27:09,396 --> 01:27:10,156
Julius!

1253
01:27:12,349 --> 01:27:13,233
You don't know this...

1254
01:27:13,491 --> 01:27:16,110
and I promised Vince
that I wouldn't tell you...

1255
01:27:16,171 --> 01:27:19,113
but he's got something in
the trunk that's worth millions.

1256
01:27:19,299 --> 01:27:22,917
I'm worried he's gonna get
himself killed delivering it.

1257
01:27:29,368 --> 01:27:31,450
Okay, yeah. Yes, Mr. Beetroot.

1258
01:27:32,002 --> 01:27:35,132
Yeah, I'll find it. Yeah.

1259
01:27:36,549 --> 01:27:37,925
Yes, I have a map.

1260
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:40,148
All right. I'll see you there.

1261
01:27:40,485 --> 01:27:41,607
See you in Houston in the morning.

1262
01:27:42,170 --> 01:27:43,476
I'll be looking forward to it.

1263
01:27:46,133 --> 01:27:47,034
What a coincidence.

1264
01:27:48,186 --> 01:27:49,367
That was our friend.

1265
01:27:50,355 --> 01:27:52,325
Looks like I'm gonna be
doing business with... him.

1266
01:27:54,706 --> 01:27:55,243
Sorry.

1267
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:57,529
I would have done the same thing.

1268
01:27:57,973 --> 01:28:01,074
You want the merchandise.
It's not your problem who delivers.

1269
01:28:01,668 --> 01:28:02,318
Precisely.

1270
01:28:09,063 --> 01:28:10,638
But how will you find him?

1271
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:12,828
I have him in my head.

1272
01:28:13,421 --> 01:28:16,451
Don't worry, ladies. I found
him once, I'll find him again.

1273
01:28:17,421 --> 01:28:18,924
I hope so. Bye.

1274
01:28:19,677 --> 01:28:20,351
Be careful.

1275
01:29:59,703 --> 01:30:00,789
Sorry I'm late.

1276
01:30:01,162 --> 01:30:04,309
-The directions you gave me weren't-
-Step back.

1277
01:30:09,114 --> 01:30:09,907
Get over here.

1278
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:12,037
I'm unarmed.

1279
01:30:13,686 --> 01:30:14,564
He's clean.

1280
01:30:15,841 --> 01:30:18,543
Oh, oh. Isn't that pretty!

1281
01:30:19,097 --> 01:30:20,910
Yeah, it is.

1282
01:30:21,104 --> 01:30:23,822
-Did you come here alone, unarmed?
-Yeah.

1283
01:30:24,042 --> 01:30:26,333
You're just some fool who stole a car?

1284
01:30:28,540 --> 01:30:29,664
Yeah, I guess I am.

1285
01:30:30,891 --> 01:30:33,150
You don't know what
the hell this is, do you?

1286
01:30:35,893 --> 01:30:36,353
No.

1287
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:39,776
Revolutionary fuel-injection
system for jets.

1288
01:30:40,596 --> 01:30:43,360
Worth a fortune to the company that
brings it to the market first.

1289
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:47,248
Somebody else developed it,
but I just had to have it.

1290
01:30:48,447 --> 01:30:50,059
Crafty devil, huh?

1291
01:30:52,034 --> 01:30:53,101
What are you waiting for?

1292
01:30:55,203 --> 01:30:56,418
Wait a minute, Beetroot!

1293
01:30:56,479 --> 01:30:59,010
-I thought we had a deal.
-We do.

1294
01:31:09,587 --> 01:31:10,773
Five million bucks!

1295
01:31:10,898 --> 01:31:13,643
-You wanna count it?
-No, no.

1296
01:31:14,375 --> 01:31:18,035
-But I could use a lift to town.
-Don't press your luck.

1297
01:31:19,165 --> 01:31:20,193
Okay. That's all right.

1298
01:31:20,866 --> 01:31:24,847
I gassed it up for you,
Beetroot. Thank you!

1299
01:31:25,753 --> 01:31:28,080
Five million dollars!
Five million bucks!

1300
01:31:29,918 --> 01:31:33,084
Ha-ha-ha! Five million bucks!

1301
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,538
I've gotta look at it!

1302
01:32:21,457 --> 01:32:22,564
Hey, Benedict!

1303
01:32:23,247 --> 01:32:24,583
All I want is the money.

1304
01:32:25,851 --> 01:32:28,326
Just give me what's mine
and I'll leave you alone.

1305
01:33:21,763 --> 01:33:23,119
Leave my brother alone.

1306
01:33:23,925 --> 01:33:24,499
No.

1307
01:33:26,607 --> 01:33:27,455
Julius.

1308
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,832
No, no, no.

1309
01:33:31,893 --> 01:33:33,538
No, no.

1310
01:33:37,591 --> 01:33:40,951
Julius, you're-you're here?

1311
01:33:41,031 --> 01:33:43,492
No. No, you idiot.

1312
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:45,063
Don't be nervous.

1313
01:33:45,916 --> 01:33:49,071
I hate violence.
Plus I never carry a gun.

1314
01:33:50,474 --> 01:33:51,897
Who are you?

1315
01:33:52,001 --> 01:33:53,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1316
01:33:54,056 --> 01:33:56,016
Put the gun down.
I got the money.

1317
01:33:56,114 --> 01:33:57,865
Here's your money.
Here's your money.

1318
01:34:00,294 --> 01:34:01,373
Here's the money.

1319
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:04,615
You're a goddamned millionaire.

1320
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:10,731
You, I am never
gonna forgive... never.

1321
01:34:11,554 --> 01:34:13,302
-Open it.
-Open it?

1322
01:34:16,397 --> 01:34:17,670
You were going to get killed.

1323
01:34:18,015 --> 01:34:20,077
I was trying to distract
him so you could escape.

1324
01:34:20,633 --> 01:34:21,973
I already had escaped!

1325
01:34:22,056 --> 01:34:24,763
I was halfway to Brazil
when I felt you!

1326
01:34:25,735 --> 01:34:28,480
-Close it.
-Close it?

1327
01:34:28,938 --> 01:34:31,024
Open it, close it.
Open it, close it.

1328
01:34:31,819 --> 01:34:33,876
-Why didn't you go?
-Why didn't I go?

1329
01:34:35,585 --> 01:34:38,638
Because thanks to you,
I'm not only a goddamned psychic-

1330
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:39,716
Benedict!

1331
01:34:40,409 --> 01:34:43,047
-I think the case belongs to me.
-Oh, sorry.

1332
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:47,166
I am not only a goddamned psychic, I
got this disease called a conscience.

1333
01:34:47,594 --> 01:34:50,871
-No one ever said being good was easy.
-'No one ever said being good was easy'

1334
01:34:50,939 --> 01:34:52,440
Will you two shut up!

1335
01:34:52,652 --> 01:34:55,175
Butt out, pal!
You got your money.

1336
01:34:55,236 --> 01:34:58,305
Now take it and go live in
the lap of luxury somewhere.

1337
01:34:58,366 --> 01:34:59,712
Try Brazil.

1338
01:35:00,254 --> 01:35:03,633
I'm afraid it doesn't work that way.
You've seen my face.

1339
01:35:05,321 --> 01:35:06,401
Which one's first?

1340
01:35:07,643 --> 01:35:09,922
You gonna kill us, even though
we gave you the money?

1341
01:35:10,477 --> 01:35:11,199
You got it.

1342
01:35:11,617 --> 01:35:15,592
Wait, you forgot the third rule
in a crisis situation.

1343
01:35:16,246 --> 01:35:19,019
-The third rule?
-Third rule?

1344
01:35:19,726 --> 01:35:21,981
Yeah, third rule.

1345
01:35:26,207 --> 01:35:28,084
Oooh!

1346
01:35:28,353 --> 01:35:31,575
-The third rule.
-What's the third rule?

1347
01:35:31,777 --> 01:35:32,722
Duck!

1348
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:04,529
Yo!

1349
01:36:05,436 --> 01:36:07,348
Holy-shmoly!

1350
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,453
Now there's a man
with a lot on his mind.

1351
01:36:20,547 --> 01:36:22,148
Thanks for coming back, Vincent.

1352
01:36:22,888 --> 01:36:24,046
We're brothers, right?

1353
01:36:25,681 --> 01:36:28,076
-We're family.
-That's right.

1354
01:36:30,731 --> 01:36:32,281
A rich family.

1355
01:36:35,068 --> 01:36:36,840
-A good family.
-What? What?

1356
01:36:36,901 --> 01:36:38,490
-We're gonna return this money.
-No.

1357
01:36:38,551 --> 01:36:40,719
-We don't have to give it back.
-Yes, we do.

1358
01:36:40,780 --> 01:36:42,652
-Why? Why?
-We have to, believe me.

1359
01:36:47,564 --> 01:36:48,497
-Mary Ann?
-Hmm?

1360
01:36:50,309 --> 01:36:52,398
I think you'd better come
take a look at this.

1361
01:36:53,965 --> 01:36:54,922
What is it?

1362
01:37:22,709 --> 01:37:23,596
Mary Ann?

1363
01:37:25,594 --> 01:37:27,661
What a pleasant surprise.

1364
01:37:30,963 --> 01:37:32,942
You stole my family.

1365
01:37:34,656 --> 01:37:36,974
You lying son of a bitch.

1366
01:37:42,975 --> 01:37:44,599
Linda, I'm sorry.

1367
01:37:44,923 --> 01:37:47,314
I made a terrible mistake
and I apologize.

1368
01:37:47,411 --> 01:37:50,444
I-all I'm asking for
is another chance.

1369
01:37:50,728 --> 01:37:52,808
I know I don't deserve this-

1370
01:37:52,869 --> 01:37:55,154
That's right, you don't deserve it.

1371
01:38:10,668 --> 01:38:11,429
Vince?

1372
01:38:27,467 --> 01:38:29,594
Yes, this is the Benedict corporation.

1373
01:38:30,232 --> 01:38:32,818
We are a consulting firm...
a think tank.

1374
01:38:33,527 --> 01:38:36,512
Something like the Rand Corporation.

1375
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:39,242
-Only smarter.
-Only smarter.

1376
01:38:39,523 --> 01:38:41,236
Tomorrow at 3:00.

1377
01:38:41,297 --> 01:38:43,126
Yes, I'll put you down.

1378
01:38:45,040 --> 01:38:46,958
Good night, Mr. Benedicts.

1379
01:38:47,045 --> 01:38:48,267
-Good night.
-Good night.

1380
01:38:49,127 --> 01:38:52,029
That's it.
The last cheque is written.

1381
01:38:52,854 --> 01:38:56,215
What do we have left out of
the $50,000 reward?

1382
01:38:56,752 --> 01:38:58,607
After we've paid off all our debts...

1383
01:38:59,290 --> 01:39:02,312
we have exactly $12,278.

1384
01:39:02,933 --> 01:39:06,114
-$12,278. That's terrible.
-What?

1385
01:39:06,312 --> 01:39:09,150
You're just upset because
I made you return that suitcase.

1386
01:39:12,492 --> 01:39:14,046
Oh, the money.

1387
01:39:15,738 --> 01:39:17,601
You mean the four million dollars.

1388
01:39:19,368 --> 01:39:21,440
Four million dollars.
Just say it.

1389
01:39:21,543 --> 01:39:24,695
Say it... four million dollars.

1390
01:39:25,074 --> 01:39:26,482
It's a lot of money, Jules.

1391
01:39:27,918 --> 01:39:30,796
Vincent...
I'm very proud of you.

1392
01:39:33,102 --> 01:39:33,789
Well...

1393
01:39:34,949 --> 01:39:36,502
yeah, I'm kinda proud of myself.

1394
01:39:38,888 --> 01:39:41,543
Isn't it great to be one
of the good guys for a change?

1395
01:39:42,350 --> 01:39:44,800
It feels great to be a good guy!

1396
01:39:45,663 --> 01:39:48,648
You're a great guy, too.
You came back for me, huh?

1397
01:39:48,906 --> 01:39:51,559
-You did steal a car though.
-I borrowed one.

1398
01:39:51,620 --> 01:39:55,110
I brought it back the next day.
I explained it to the man.

1399
01:39:55,530 --> 01:39:56,662
He was a cowboy.

1400
01:39:57,768 --> 01:39:59,909
Excuse me? I'm-

1401
01:40:01,946 --> 01:40:04,164
Oh, my God. I don't even know
which one is which.

1402
01:40:08,462 --> 01:40:10,464
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

1403
01:40:11,787 --> 01:40:14,055
You see, I didn't believe your story.

1404
01:40:14,995 --> 01:40:17,344
Who would believe
a crazy story like that?

1405
01:40:21,747 --> 01:40:23,416
They lied to me all these years.

1406
01:40:24,209 --> 01:40:25,469
They lied to you, too.

1407
01:40:36,021 --> 01:40:37,148
You found each other.

1408
01:40:44,759 --> 01:40:45,866
Now you found me.

1409
01:41:06,599 --> 01:41:07,448
Mama?

1410
01:41:09,505 --> 01:41:10,245
Mama!

1411
01:41:13,045 --> 01:41:14,018
Mama!

1412
01:41:14,079 --> 01:41:15,072
Oh, mama!

1413
01:41:35,182 --> 01:41:35,875
Good.

1414
01:41:37,220 --> 01:41:37,872
Tickets?

1415
01:41:39,730 --> 01:41:40,816
Thanks. This is gonna be great.

1416
01:41:41,599 --> 01:41:44,022
I just can't get over
how alike they are.

1417
01:41:44,829 --> 01:41:47,166
Yes, it's a beautiful day.
